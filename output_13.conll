Glutaric B-Disease
acidemia I-Disease
type I-Disease
1 I-Disease
(GA-1) O
is O
an O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
of O
lysine, O
hydroxylysine, O
and O
tryptophan B-Chemical
metabolism O
caused O
by O
deficiency O
of O
glutaryl-CoA O
dehydrogenase. O
It O
results O
in O
the O
accumulation O
of O
3-hydroxyglutaric O
and O
glutaric O
acid. O
Affected O

and O
with O
acute O

be O
identified O
by O
increased O
glutaryl B-Chemical
(C5DC) O

Therapy O
consists O
in O
