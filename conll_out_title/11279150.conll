# Abstract
While O
studying O
the O
cellular O
localization O
and O
activity O
of O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
we O
discovered O
that O
the O
published O
sequence O
for O
the O
glucuronic O
acid O
C5-epimerase O
responsible O
for O
the O
interconversion O
of O
d-glucuronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
l-iduronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
residues O
encodes O
a O
truncated O
protein. O
Genome O
analysis O
and O
5'-rapid O
amplification O
of O
cDNA O

was O
used O
to O
clone O
the O
full-length O
cDNA O
from O
a O
mouse B-Species
mastocytoma B-Disease
cell O
line. O
The O
extended O
cDNA O
encodes O
for O
an O
additional O
174 O
amino O
acids O
at O
the O
amino O
terminus O
of O
the O
protein. O
The O
murine B-Species
sequence O
is O
95% O
identical O
to O
the O
human B-Species
epimerase O
identified O
from O
genomic O
sequences O
and O
fits O
with O
the O
general O
size O
and O
structure O
of O
the O
gene O
from O
Drosophila B-Species

and O
Caenorhabditis O
elegans. O
Full-length O
epimerase O

predicted O
to O
have O
a O
type O
II O
transmembrane O
topology O
with O
a O
17-amino O
acid O
transmembrane O
domain O
and O
an O
11-amino O
acid O
cytoplasmic O
tail. O
An O
assay O
with O
increased O
sensitivity O
was O
devised O
that O
detects O
enzyme O
activity O
in O
extracts O
prepared O
from O
cultured O
cells O
and O
in O
recombinant O
proteins. O
Unlike O
other O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
glycosaminoglycan O
biosynthesis, O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
c-myc O

or O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
to O
the O
highly O
conserved O
COOH-terminal O
portion O
of O
the O
protein O
inhibits O
its O
activity. O
The O
amino-terminally O
truncated O
epimerase O
does O
not O
localize O
to O
any O
cellular O
compartment, O
whereas O
the O
full-length O
enzyme O
is O
in O
the O
Golgi, O
where O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
synthesis O
is O
thought O
to O
occur. O
