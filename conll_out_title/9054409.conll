# Abstract
The O
crystal O
structure O
of O
the O
recombinant O
form O
of O
rat B-Species
liver O
fatty O
acid-binding O
protein O
was O
completed O
to O
2.3 O
A O
and O
refined O
to O
an O
R O
factor O
of O
19.0%. O
The O
structural O
solution O
was O
obtained O
by O
molecular O
replacement O
using O
superimposed O
polyalanine B-Chemical
coordinates O
of O
six O
intracellular O
lipid-binding O
proteins O
as O
a O
search O
probe. O
The O
entire O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
of O
rat B-Species
liver O
fatty O
acid-binding O
protein O
along O
with O
an O
amino-terminal O
formyl-methionine B-Chemical
was O
modeled O
in O
the O
crystal O
structure. O
In O
addition, O
the O
crystal O
was O
obtained O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
oleic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
the O
initial O
electron O
density O
clearly O
showed O
two O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
molecules O
bound O
within O
a O
central O
cavity. O
The O
carboxylate B-Chemical
of O
one O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
molecule O
interacts O
with O
arginine B-Chemical
122 O
and O
is O
shielded O
from O
free O
solvent. O
It O
has O
an O
overall O
bent O
conformation. O
The O
more O
solvent-exposed O
carboxylate B-Chemical
of O
the O
other O
oleate O
is O
located O
near O
the O
helix-turn-helix O
that O
caps O
one O
end O
of O
the O
beta-barrel, O
while O
the O
acyl O
chain O
lies O
in O
the O
interior. O
The O
cavity O
contains O
both O
polar O
and O
nonpolar O
residues O
but O
also O
shows O
extensive O
hydrophobic O
character O
around O
the O
nonpolar O
atoms O
of O
the O
ligands. O
The O
primary O
and O
secondary O
oleate O
binding O
sites O
appear O
to O
be O
totally O
interdependent, O
mainly O
because O
favorable O
hydrophobic O
interactions O
form O
between O
both O
aliphatic O
chains. O
