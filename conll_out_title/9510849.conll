# Abstract
We O
present O
a O
new O
derivatization O
procedure O
for O
the O
simultaneous O
gas O
chromatographic-mass O
spectrometric O
analysis O
of O
free O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
3-hydroxyfatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
in O
plasma. O
Derivatization O
of O
target O
compounds O
involved O
trifluoroacetylation O
of O
hydroxyl O
groups O
and O
tert-butyldimethylsilylation O
of O
the O
carboxyl O
groups. O
This O
new O
derivatization O
procedure O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
allowing O
the O
complete O
baseline O
separation O
of O
free O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
3-hydroxyfatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
while O
the O
superior O
gas O
chromatographic O
and O
mass O
spectrometric O
properties O
of O
tert-butyldimethylsilyl B-Chemical
derivatives O
remained O
unchanged, O
permitting O
a O
sensitive O
analysis O
of O
the O
target O
compounds. O
Thirty-nine O
plasma O
samples O
from O
control O
subjects O
and O
patients B-Species
with O
known O
defects O
of O
mitochondrial B-Disease
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical

were O
analyzed. O
A O
characteristic O
increase O
of O
long-chain B-Chemical
3-hydroxyfatty I-Chemical

was O
observed O
for O
all O

and O
mitochondrial B-Disease
trifunctional I-Disease
protein-deficient I-Disease

For O
medium-chain B-Disease

and O
very-long-chain B-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
decenoic B-Chemical
and O
tetradecenoic B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
respectively, O
were O
the O
main O
abnormal O
fatty B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
whereas O
the O
multiple B-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase-deficient I-Disease
patients B-Species
showed O
variable O

of O
these O
unusual O

The O
results O
showed O
that O
this O
selective O
and O
sensitive O
method O
is O
a O
powerful O
tool O
in O
the O
diagnosis O

monitoring O
of O
