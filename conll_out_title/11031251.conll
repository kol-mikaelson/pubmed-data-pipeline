# Abstract
Mammals O
contain O
a O
diverse O
set O
of O
secreted O
phospholipases O
A(2) O
(sPLA(2)s) B-Gene
that O
liberate O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
from O
phospholipids B-Chemical
for O
the O
production O
of O
eicosanoids B-Chemical
and O
exert O
a O
variety O
of O
physiological O
and O
pathological O
effects. O
We O
report O
the O
cloning, O
recombinant O
expression, O
and O
kinetic O
properties O
of O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
sPLA(2) B-Gene
that O
defines O
a O
new O
structural O
class O
of O
sPLA(2)s B-Gene
called O
group O
XII. O
The O
human B-Species
group O
XII O
(hGXII) O
cDNA O
contains O
a O
putative O
signal O
peptide O
of O
22 O
residues O
followed O
by O
a O
mature O
protein O
of O
167 O
amino O
acids O
that O
displays O
homology O
to O
all O
known O
sPLA(2)s B-Gene
only O
over O
a O
short O
stretch O
of O
amino O
acids O
in O
the O
active O
site O
region. O
Northern O
blot O
and O
reverse O
transcription-polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
analyses O
show O
that O
the O
tissue O
distribution O
of O
hGXII O
is O
distinct O
from O
the O
other O
human B-Species
sPLA(2)s B-Gene
with O
strong O
expression O
in O
heart, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
kidney, O
and O
pancreas O
and O
weaker O
expression O
in O
brain, O
liver, O
small O
intestine, O
lung, O
placenta, O
ovaries, O
testis, O
and O
prostate. O
Catalytically O
active O
hGXII O
was O
produced O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
shown O
to O
be O
Ca(2+)-dependent O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
predicted O
to O
have O
an O
unusual O
Ca(2+)-binding O
loop. O
Similar O
to O
the O
previously O
characterized O
mouse B-Species
group O
IIE O
sPLA(2)s, B-Gene
the O
specific O
activity O
of O
hGXII O
is O
low O
in O
comparison O
to O
that O
of O
other O
mammalian O
sPLA(2), B-Gene
suggesting O
that O
hGXII O
could O
have O
novel O
functions O
that O
are O
independent O
of O
its O
phospholipase B-Gene
A(2) I-Gene
activity. O
