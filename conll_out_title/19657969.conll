# Abstract
The O
system O
IMINO O
transporter O
plays O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
the O
transport O
of O
proline B-Chemical
and O
hydroxyproline B-Chemical
in O
the O
intestine O
and O
kidney. O
Its O
molecular O
correlate O
has O
been O
identified O
and O
named O
SIT1 B-Gene
or O
IMINO O
(SLC6A20). B-Gene
Initial O
characterization O
of O
the O
transporter O
showed O
it O
to O
be O
Na(+) O
and O
Cl(-)-dependent, O
but O
the O
stoichiometry O
remained O
unresolved. O
Using O
homology O
modeling O
along O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
bacterial O
leucine O
transporter O
LeuT, B-Gene
we O
identified O
two O
highly O
conserved O
Na(+)-binding O
sites O
and O
a O
putative O
Cl(-)-binding O
site. O
Mutation O
of O
all O
residues O
in O
the O
two O
proposed O
Na(+)-binding O
sites O
revealed O
that O
most O
of O
them O
were O
essential O
for O
uptake O
and O
completely O
inactivated O
the O
transporter. O
However, O
mutants O
A22V B-ProteinMutation
(Na(+)-binding O
site O
1) O
and O
mutants O
S20A, B-ProteinMutation
S20G, B-ProteinMutation
S20G B-ProteinMutation
G405S B-ProteinMutation
(Na(+)-binding O
site O
2) O
were O
partially O
active O
and O
characterized O
further. O
Flux B-Chemical
studies O
suggested O
that O
mutations O
of O
Na(+)-binding O
site O
1 O
caused O
a O
decrease O
of O
the O
Na(+)-K(0.5), O
whereas O
mutations O
of O
site O
2 O
increased O
the O
K(0.5). O
Mutation O
of O
Na(+)-binding O
site O
1 O
also O
changed O
the O
ion O
selectivity O
of O
the O
IMINO O
transporter. O
IMINO O
actively O
translocates O
(36)Cl(-) B-Chemical
demonstrating O
that O
the O
proposed O
chloride B-Chemical
binding O
site O
is O
used O
in O
the O
transporter. O
Accumulation O
experiments O
and O
flux B-Chemical
measurements O
at O
different O
holding O
potentials O
showed O
that O
the O
transporter O
can O
work O
as O
a O
2Na(+) O
1Cl(-)-proline O
cotransporter. O
The O
proposed O
homology O
model O
allows O
to O
study O
mutations O
in O
IMINO O
associated O
with O
iminoglycinuria. B-Disease
