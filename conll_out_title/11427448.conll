# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
The O
diagnosis O
of O
long-chain B-Disease
L-3-hydroxy-acyl-coenzyme I-Disease
A I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
(LCHAD) B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
frequently O
requires O
the O
study O
of O
cultured O
fibroblasts. O
We O
developed O
such O
a O
test O
that O
does O
not O
require O
disruption O
and O
loss O
of O
the O
cells. O
METHODS: O
We O
measured O
free B-Chemical
3-hydroxy I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(3-OHFAs) B-Chemical
in O
media O
of O
skin O
fibroblasts O
cultures O
from O
11 O
patients B-Species
with O
a O
genetic O
deficiency B-Disease
of I-Disease
LCHAD B-Disease
and O
the O
associated O
disorder O
of O
mitochondrial O
trifunctional O
protein O
(MTFP). O
Fibroblasts O
were O
cultured O
for O
24 O
h O
with O
100 O
micromol O
L O
nonisotopic O
palmitate B-Chemical
added. O
3-OHFAs B-Chemical
were O
measured O
by O
selected-ion O
monitoring, O
stable-isotope O
dilution O
gas O
chromatography-mass O
spectrometry O
with O
[(13)C]-labeled O
internal O
standards. O
RESULTS: O
3-OH-hexadecanoic B-Chemical
and O
3-OH-tetradecanoic B-Chemical
FAs I-Chemical
were O
increased O
14- O
and O
11-fold, O
respectively, O
in O
all O
patients B-Species
with O
LCHAD B-Disease
or O
MTFP B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
when O
compared O
with O
control O
fibroblast O
cell O
lines O
after O
overnight O
incubation O
with O
palmitate. B-Chemical
3-OH-dodecanoic B-Chemical
FA I-Chemical
demonstrated O
a O
modest, O
fivefold O
increase O
in O
LCHAD-deficient O
cells. O
The O
concentrations O
of O
all O
3-OHFAs B-Chemical
were O
similar O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
medium O
samples O
were O
hydrolyzed O
to O
release O
conjugated O
species O
such O
as O
acylcarnitines, B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
3-OHFAs B-Chemical
accumulate O
in O
the O
media O
as O
free O
FAs. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Measurement O
of O
3-OHFA O
excretion O
from O
LCHAD- B-Disease
or O
MTFP-deficient O
cell O
lines O
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
diagnostic O
tool. O
Free O
FAs O
are O
the O
predominant O
form O
of O
these O
abnormal O
metabolic O
intermediates O
in O
culture O
media. O
