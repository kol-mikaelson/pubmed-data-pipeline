# Abstract
Enantioselective O
multidimensional O
gas O
chromatography-mass O
spectrometry O
(enantio-MDGC-MS) O
is O
a O
valuable O
tool O
for O
the O
differentiation O
of O
enantiomers O
from O
complex O
matrices O
when O
present O
in O
trace O
amounts. O
The O
separation O
of O
chiral O
compounds O
provides O
further O
information O
on O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
diseases, O
and O
on O
normal O
and O
abnormal O
biochemical O
pathways. O
The O
formation O
of O
the O
normal O
urinary O
metabolite O
3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(HMBA), B-Chemical
excreted O
in O
abnormally O
high O
amounts O
in O
beta-ketothiolase B-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
is O
not O
absolutely O
clarified. O
Metabolic O
pathways O
involving O
this O
metabolite O
are O
isoleucine B-Chemical
catabolism, O
as O
well O
as O
presumably O
beta-oxidation O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
ketogenesis. O
The O
latter O
two O
pathways O
are O
distinguishable O
in O
their O
enantioselectivity. O
Enantioselective O
analysis O
gives O
further O
information O
on O
interfering O
metabolic O
pathways O
and O
the O
selectivity O
of O
the O
enzyme(s) O
forming O
HMBA. B-Chemical
Different O
ratios O
of O
the O
stereoisomers O
of O
HMBA B-Chemical
in O
control O
urine O
samples O
and O
patients B-Species
with O
beta-ketothiolase B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
were O
detected. O
Analogous O
to O
HMBA B-Chemical
urinary O
3-hydroxybutanoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(HBA) B-Chemical
was O
investigated O
in O
several O
diseases. O
The O
formation O
of O
HBA B-Chemical
and O
HMBA B-Chemical
is O
expected O
to O
result O
from O
the O
same O
or O
similar O
metabolic O
pathways. O
Differences O
in O
the O
enantiomeric O
ratio O
of O
HMBA B-Chemical
may O
originate O
from O
the O
enantioselectivity O
of O
different O
enzyme O
systems. O
