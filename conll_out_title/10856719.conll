# Abstract
Sphingolipids B-Chemical
constitute O
a O
sizeable O
fraction O
of O
the O
membrane O
lipids B-Chemical
in O
all O
eukaryotes O
and O
are O
indispensable O
for O
eukaryotic O
life. O
First O
of O
all, O
the O
involvement O
of O
sphingolipids B-Chemical
in O
organizing O
the O
lateral O
domain O
structure O
of O
membranes O
appears O
essential O
for O
processes O
like O
protein O
sorting O
and O
membrane O
signaling. O
In O
addition, O
recognition O
events O
between O
complex O
glycosphingolipids O
and O
glycoproteins O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
required O
for O
tissue O
differentiation O
in O
higher O
eukaryotes O
and O
for O
other O
specific O
cell O
interactions. O
Finally, O
upon O
certain O
stimuli O
like O
stress O
or O
receptor O
activation, O
sphingolipids B-Chemical
give O
rise O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
second O
messengers O
with O
effects O
on O
cellular O
homeostasis. O
All O
sphingolipid B-Chemical
actions O
are O
governed O
by O
their O
local O
concentration. O
The O
intricate O
control O
of O
their O
intracellular O
topology O
by O
the O
proteins O
responsible O
for O
their O
synthesis, O
hydrolysis O
and O
intracellular O
transport O
is O
the O
topic O
of O
this O
review. O
