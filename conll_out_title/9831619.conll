# Abstract
In O
mammalian O
cells, O
membrane O
uptake O
of O
long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
is O
mediated O
by O
two O
separate O
components; O
a O
passive O
component O
that O
is O
a O
linear O
function O
of O
the O
concentration O
of O
free O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
in O
the O
extracellular O
medium O
and O
a O
saturable O
component O
that O
exhibits O
the O
characteristics O
of O
a O
protein-facilitated O
process. O
This O
review O
summarizes O
the O
body O
of O
work O
that O
has O
accumulated O
related O
to O
the O
mechanism O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transport. O
Evidence O
in O
support O
of O
a O
facilitated O
uptake O
process O
is O
presented O
with O
relation O
to O
the O
different O
cell O
types O
or O
membrane O
systems O
where O
it O
was O
collected. O
The O
evidence O
includes O
saturation O
kinetics, O
competition O
between O
different O
substrates, O
and O
sensitivity O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
inhibitors. O
Recent O
knowledge O
related O
to O
membrane O
proteins O
thought O
to O
be O
implicated O
in O
the O
uptake O
process O
is O
reviewed. O
Factors O
that O
may O
modulate O
uptake O
or O
alter O
the O
relative O
contribution O
of O
passive O
versus O
facilitated O
components O
are O
briefly O
discussed. O
These O
include O
the O
molar O
ratio O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
its O
physiological O
carrier, O
plasma O
albumin O
and O
the O
metabolic O
or O
hormonal O
milieu. O
