# Abstract
A O
cDNA O
was O
isolated O
from O
the O
mouse B-Species
brain O
that O
encodes O
a O
novel O
Na(+)-independent O
neutral O
amino O
acid O
transporter. O
The O
encoded O
protein, O
designated O
as O
Asc-1 B-Gene
(asc-type B-Gene
amino I-Gene
acid I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
1), I-Gene
was O
found O

be O
structurally O

or O

Asc-1 B-Gene
required O
4F2hc B-Gene
for O
its O
functional O
expression. O
In O
Western O

in O
the O
nonreducing O
condition, O
a O
118-kDa O
band, O
which O
seems O
to O
correspond O
to O
the O
heterodimeric O
complex O
of O
Asc-1 B-Gene
and O
4F2hc, B-Gene
was O
detected O
in O
the O
mouse B-Species
brain. O
The O
band O
shifted O
to O
33 O
kDa O
in O
the O
reducing O
condition, O
confirming O
that O
Asc-1 B-Gene
and O
4F2hc B-Gene
are O
linked O
via O
a O
disulfide B-Chemical
bond. O
Asc-1-mediated O
transport O
was O
not O
dependent O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
Na(+) O
or O

Although O
