# Abstract
Sphingolipids B-Chemical
desaturated O
at O
the O
Delta4-position O
are O
important O
signaling O
molecules O
in O
many O
eukaryotic O
organisms, O
including O
mammals. O
In O
a O
bioinformatics O
approach, O
we O
now O
identified O
a O
new O
family O
of O
protein O
sequences O
from O
animals, O
plants, O
and O
fungi O
and O
characterized O
these O
sequences O
biochemically O
by O
expression O
in O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae. I-Species
This O
resulted O
in O
the O
identification O
of O
the O
enzyme O
sphingolipid B-Gene
Delta4-desaturase I-Gene
(dihydroceramide O
desaturase) O
from O
Homo B-Species
sapiens, I-Species
Mus B-Species
musculus, I-Species
Drosophila B-Species
melanogaster, I-Species
and O
Candida B-Species
albicans, I-Species
in O
addition O
to O
a O
bifunctional O
sphingolipid B-Gene
Delta4-desaturase I-Gene
C-4-hydroxylase I-Gene
from O
M. B-Species
musculus. I-Species
Among O
the O
sequences O
investigated O
are O
the O
Homo B-Species
sapiens I-Species
membrane B-Gene
lipid I-Gene
desaturase, I-Gene
the O
M. B-Species
musculus I-Species
degenerative O
spermatocyte, O
and O
the O
Drosophila B-Species
melanogaster I-Species
degenerative O
spermatocyte O
proteins. O
During O
spermatogenesis, O
but O
not O
oogenesis O
of O
des B-Gene
mutant O
flies, O
both O
cell O
cycle O
and O
spermatid O
differentiation O
are O
specifically O
blocked O
at O
the O
entry O
into O
the O
first O
meiotic O
division, O
leading O
to O
male B-Disease
sterility. I-Disease
This O
mutant O
phenotype O
can O
be O
restored O
to O
wild-type O
by O
complementation O
with O
a O
functional O
copy O
of O
the O
des B-Gene
gene O
(Endo, O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
Delta4-desaturated O
sphingolipids B-Chemical
provide O
an O
early O
signal O
necessary O
to O
trigger O
the O
entry O
into O
both O
meiotic O
and O
spermatid O
differentiation O
pathways O
during O
Drosophila O
spermatogenesis. O
