# Abstract
Atorvastatin B-Chemical
is O
a O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme B-Gene
A I-Gene
(HMG-CoA) I-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitor O
that O
is O
mainly O
metabolized O
by O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) I-Gene
3A4. I-Gene
A O
recent O
study O
showed O
that O
the O
lipid-lowering O
effect O
of O
statins O
is O
affected O
by O
the O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
polymorphism. O
Therefore, O
it O
was O
investigated O
whether O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
contributes O
to O
the O
metabolism O
of O
atorvastatin. B-Chemical
Two O
metabolites O
of O
atorvastatin, B-Chemical
para- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin, I-Chemical
were O
produced O
by O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
and O
human B-Species
recombinant O
CYP3A B-Gene
enzymes, O
and O
the O
enzyme O

exhibited O
substrate O
inhibition. O
The O
intrinsic O
clearance O
(CL(int)) O
rates O
of O
para- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin I-Chemical
by O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
were O
2.4- O
and O
5.0-fold O
of O
the O
respective O
CL(int) O
rates O
of O
CYP3A5, B-Gene
indicating O
that O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
is O
the O
major O
P450 O
isoform O
responsible O
for O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
metabolism. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
is O
preferentially O
metabolized O
by O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
rather O
than O
by O
CYP3A5, B-Gene
and O
thus O
the O
genetic O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
polymorphism O
might O
not O
be O
an O
important O
factor O
in O
the O
inter-individual O
variation O
of O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
disposition O
and O
pharmacodynamics O
in O
