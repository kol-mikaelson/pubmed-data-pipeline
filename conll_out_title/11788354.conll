# Abstract
Efficient O
uptake O
and O
channeling O
of O
long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(LCFAs) B-Chemical
are O
critical O
cellular O
functions. O
Although O
spontaneous O
flip-flop O
of O
nonionized O
LCFAs B-Chemical
from O
one O
leaflet O
of O
a O
bilayer O
to O
the O
other O
is O
rapid, O
evidence O
is O
emerging O
that O
proteins O
are O
important O
mediators O
and O
or O
regulators O
of O
trafficking O
of O
LCFAs B-Chemical
into O
and O
within O
cells. O
Genetic O
screens O
have O
led O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
proteins O
that O
are O
required O
for O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
import O
and O
utilization O
in O
prokaryotic O
organisms. O
In O
addition, O
functional O
screens O
have O
elucidated O
proteins O
that O
facilitate O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
import O
into O
mammalian O
cells. O
Although O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
these O
proteins O
mediate O
LCFA O
import O
are O
not O
well O
understood, O
studies O
in O
both O
prokaryotic O
and O
eukaryotic O
organisms O
provide O
compelling O
evidence O
that O
uptake O
of O
LCFAs B-Chemical
across O
cellular O
membranes O
is O
coupled O
to O
esterification O
by O
acyl-CoA O
synthetases. O
This O
review O
will O
summarize O
results O
of O
studies O
of O
non-protein-mediated O
and O
protein-mediated O
LCFA O
transport O
and O
discuss O
how O
these O
different O
mechanisms O
may O
contribute O
to O
cellular O
metabolism. O
