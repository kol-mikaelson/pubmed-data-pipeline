# Abstract
There O
are O
some O
indications O
from O
clinical O
studies O
(41,43) O
for O
aberrant O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolism O
resulting O
in O
formation O
of O
potentially O
toxic O
metabolites. O
When O
the O
activity O
of O
cytochrome O
P450 B-Gene
3A O
enzymes O
is O
low, O
more O
substrate O
is O
available O
for O
hypothetical O
alternative O
pathways O
of O
cyclosporine. B-Chemical
There O
are O
several O
reasons O
for O
low O
P450 B-Gene
3A O
activity O
in O
a O
liver O
graft O
such O
as O
inter-individual O
genetic O

(43,49,84), O

and O

changes O
of O
the O
P450 B-Gene

during O

(86), O
the O
influence O
of O
cytokines O
(87) O
and O
drug O
interactions O
such O
as O
inhibition O
or O
enzyme O
induction O
(88). O
Furthermore, O
low O
concentrations O
of O
cytochrome O
P450 B-Gene
3A O
influence O
the O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
blood O
trough O
concentrations. O
The O
P450 B-Gene
3A O
concentration O
as O
estimated O
by O
the O
erythromycin B-Chemical
breath O
test O
can O
be O
used O
to O
calculate O
the O
initial O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
dose O
required O
to O
obtain O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
blood O
trough O
concentrations O
in O
the O
therapeutic O
window O
(89). O
In O
vitro O
such O
alternative O
pathways O
comprising O
3-methylcholanthrene-inducible O
(44,46,47) O
and O
or O
ethinyl O
estradiol-inducible O
cytochrome O
P450 B-Gene
enzymes O
(48) O
could O
be O
identified O
and O
resulted O
in O
production O
of O
cyclized O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolites. O
The O
exact O
identification O
of O
the O
P450 B-Gene
enzymes O
involved O
requires O
metabolism O
of O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
using O
reconstituted O
purified O
enzymes O
or O
single O
P450 B-Gene
enzymes O
expressed O
in O
cell O
lines. O
In O
addition, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
clarified O
whether O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
itself O
or O
its O
metabolite O
AM1 B-Chemical
is O
the O
substrate O
for O
cyclization. O
Because O
cyclized O
metabolites O
have O
a O
low O
affinity O
to O
cyclophilin O
(58,59) O
they O
are O
mainly O
found O
in O
plasma. O
When O
more O
cyclized O
metabolites O
are O
formed O
primarily O
the O
concentration O
of O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolites O
in O
plasma O
increases. O
The O
free O
fraction O
of O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
at O
37 O
degrees O
C O
was O
found O
to O
be O
1%-1.5% O
(90,91) O
of O
the O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
concentration O
in O
blood. O
To O
date, O
nothing O
is O
known O
about O
the O
free O
fraction O
of O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolites. O
Because O
distribution O
characteristics O
of O
the O
cyclized O
metabolites O
in O
blood O
and O
urine O
are O
different O
from O
those O
of O
cyclosporine, B-Chemical
it O
can O
be O
speculated O
that O
the O
free O
fraction O
of O
the O
cyclized O
metabolites O
is O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
cyclosporine. B-Chemical
This O
might O
be O
reflected O
by O
a O
higher O
renal O
clearance O
resulting O
in O
relatively O
higher O
concentrations O
in O
urine O
compared O
with O
blood O
(61; O
Figure O

If O
this O
is O
the O
case, O
a O
shift O
in O
the O
metabolite O
pattern O
with O
increased O
concentrations O
of O
cyclized O
metabolites O
will O
lead O
to O
an O
overproportional O
increase O
of O
the O
free O
fraction O
of O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolites. O
Although O
it O
is O
tempting O
to O
assume O
that O
cyclization O
is O
the O
alternative O
pathway O
explaining O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
toxicity B-Disease
in O
patients B-Species
with O
low O
concentrations O
of O
P450 B-Gene
3A O
enzymes O
in O
the O
liver O
(Figure O

this O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
proven O
and O
will O
require O
not O
only O
quantification O
of O
P450 B-Gene
3A O
but O
of O
the O
complete O
P450 B-Gene
enzyme O
pattern O
in O
the O
liver O
in O
combination O
with O
characterization O
of O
the O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolite O
pattern O
by O
HPLC O
with O
special O
respect O
to O
the O
cyclized O
metabolites O
AM1c B-Chemical
and O
AM1c9. B-Chemical
Also, O
it O
is O
still O
unclear O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
cyclized O
metabolites O
contribute O
to O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
toxicity. B-Disease
At O
least, O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
they O
are O
involved O
in O
covalent O
binding O
to O
macromolecules O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
kidney O
(44,71). O
In O

an O
HPLC O
method O
which O
allowed O
the O

that O

it O
was O
shown O
in O
an O

that O
