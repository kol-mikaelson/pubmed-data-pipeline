# Abstract
Desmosterolosis B-Disease
is O
a O
rare O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
characterized O
by O
multiple O
congenital B-Disease
anomalies. I-Disease
Patients B-Species
with O
desmosterolosis B-Disease
have O
elevated O
levels O
of O
the O
cholesterol B-Chemical
precursor O
desmosterol, B-Chemical
in O
plasma, O
tissue, O
and O
cultured O
cells; O
this O
abnormality O
suggests O
a O
deficiency O
of O
the O
enzyme B-Disease
3beta-hydroxysterol B-Gene
Delta24-reductase I-Gene
(DHCR24), B-Gene
which, O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
catalyzes O
the O
reduction O
of O
the O
Delta24 O
double O

of O
sterol B-Chemical
intermediates. O
We O

confirmed O
that O
it O

DHCR24. B-Gene
The O

DHCR24 B-Gene
in O

spans O
approximately O
46.4 O
kb, O
is O

Sequence O
analysis O
of O
DHCR24 B-Gene
in O
two O
patients B-Species

desmosterolosis B-Disease
revealed O
four O
