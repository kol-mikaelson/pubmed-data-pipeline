# Abstract
Tattered B-Gene
(Td) O
is O
an O
X-linked, O
semi-dominant O
mouse B-Species
mutation O
associated O
with O
prenatal O
male O
lethality. O
Heterozygous O
females O
are O
small O
and O
at O
4-5 O
days O
of O
age O
develop O
patches O
of O
hyperkeratotic O
skin O
where O
no O
hair O
grows, O
resulting O
in O
a O
striping O
of O
the O
coat O
in O
adults. O
Craniofacial B-Disease
anomalies I-Disease
and O
twisted B-Disease
toes I-Disease
have O
also O
been O
observed O
in O
some O
affected O
females. O
A O
potential O
second O
allele O
of O
Td O
has O
also O
been O
described. O
The O
phenotype O
of O
Td O
is O
similar O
to O
that O
seen O
in O
heterozygous O
females O
with O
human B-Species

alternatively O
known O
as O
X-linked B-Disease

well O
as O
another O
X-linked, O
semi-dominant O
mouse B-Species
mutation, O
bare O

(Bpa). O
The O
Bpa O
gene O
has O
recently O
been O
identified O
and O
encodes O
a O
protein O
with O
homology O
to O
3beta-hydroxysteroid O
dehydrogenases O
that O
functions O
in O
one O
of O
the O
later O
steps O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
