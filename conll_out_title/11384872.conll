# Abstract
Androgens O
and O
estrogens O
are O
not O
only O
synthesized O
in O
the O
gonads O
but O
also O
in O
peripheral O
target O
tissues. O
Accordingly, O
recent O
molecular O
cloning O
has O
allowed O
us O
to O
identify O
multiple O
types O
of O
17beta-hydroxysteroid O
dehydrogenases O
(17beta-HSD), B-Gene
the O
key O
and O
exclusive O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
the O
formation O
and O
inactivation O
of O
sex O
steroids. O
However, O
only O
one O
form, O
namely, O
type O
3 O
17beta-HSD, B-Gene
is O
responsible O
for O
pseudohermaphroditism B-Disease
in O
deficient O
boys. O
To O
date, O
seven O
human B-Species
17beta-HSDs O
have O
been O
isolated O
and O
characterized. O
Although O
they O
catalyze O
substrates O
having O
a O
similar O
structure, O
17beta-HSDs O
have O
very O
low O
homology. O
In O
intact O
cells O
in O
culture, O
these O
enzymes O
catalyze O
the O
reaction O
in O
a O
unidirectional O
way O
- O
types O
1, O
3, O
5 O
and O
7 O
catalyze O
the O
reductive O
reaction, O
while O
types O
2, O
4 O
and O
8 O
catalyze O
the O
oxidative O
reaction. O
It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
rat O
type O
6 O
17beta-HSD B-Gene
also O
catalyzes O
the O
reaction O
in O
the O
oxidative O
direction. O
In O
this O
report, O
we O
analyze O
the O
different O
characteristics O
of O
the O
multiple O
types O
of O
