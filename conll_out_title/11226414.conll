# Abstract
A O
metabolite O
of O
homocysteine B-Chemical
(Hcy), B-Chemical
the O
thioester B-Chemical
Hcy B-Chemical
thiolactone, B-Chemical
damages O
proteins O
by O
modifying O
their O
lysine B-Chemical
residues O
which O
may O
underlie O
Hcy-associated O
cardiovascular B-Disease

in O
humans. B-Species
A O
protein O

Hcy B-Chemical
thiolactonase B-Chemical
(HTase) O
hydrolyzes O
thiolactone B-Chemical
to O
Hcy. B-Chemical
Thiolactonase B-Chemical
is O
a O
product O
of O
the O
polymorphic O
PON1 B-Gene
gene, O
also O
involved O
in O
detoxification O
of O
organophospates O
and O

Polymorphism O
in O
PON1 B-Gene
affects O
the O
detoxifying O
activity O
of O
PON1 B-Gene
in O
a O
substrate-dependent O
manner. O
However, O
how O
PON1 B-Gene
polymorphism O
affects O
HTase O
activity O
is O
unknown. O
Here O
we O
report O
a O
strong O
association O
between O
the O
thiolactonase B-Chemical
activity O
and O
PON1 B-Gene
genotype O
in O
human B-Species
populations. O
High O
thiolactonase B-Chemical
activity O
was O
associated O
with O
L55 O
and O
R192 O
alleles, O
more O
frequent O
in O
blacks O
than O
in O
whites. O
Low O
thiolactonase B-Chemical
activity O
was O
associated O
with O
M55 O
and O
Q192 O
alleles, O
more O
frequent O
in O
whites O
than O
in O
blacks. O
High O
thiolactonase B-Chemical
activity O
afforded O
better O
protection O
against O
protein O
homocysteinylation O
than O
low O
thiolactonase B-Chemical
activity. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
variations O
in O
HTase O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
Hcy-associated O
cardiovascular B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
