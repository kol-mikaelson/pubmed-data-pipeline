# Abstract
3-O-Sulfation O
of O
glucosamine B-Chemical
by O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
D-glucosaminyl O
3-O-sulfotransferase O
(3-OST-1) O
is O
the O
key O
modification O
in O
anticoagulant O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
synthesis. O
However, O
the O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfates I-Chemical
modified O
by O
3-OST-2 O
and O
3-OST-3A, O
isoforms O
of O
3-OST-1, O
do O
not O
have O
anticoagulant O
activity, O
although O
these O
isoforms O
transfer O
sulfate B-Chemical
to O
the O
3-OH O
position O
of O
glucosamine B-Chemical
residues. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
characterize O
the O
substrate O
specificity O
of O
purified O
3-OST-3A O
at O
the O
tetrasaccharide B-Chemical
level. O
The O
3-OST-3A O
enzyme O
was O
purified O
from O
Sf9 B-CellLine
cells O
infected O
with O
recombinant O
baculovirus O
containing O
3-OST-3A O
cDNA. O
Two O
3-OST-3A-modified O
tetrasaccharides B-Chemical
were O
purified O
from O
the O
3-O-(35)S-sulfated O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
that O
was O
digested O
by O
heparin O
lyases. O
These O
tetrasaccharides B-Chemical
were O
analyzed O
using O
nitrous B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
enzymatic O
degradation O
combined O
with O
matrix-assisted O
laser O
desorption O
ionization-mass O
spectrometry. O
Two O
novel O
tetrasaccharides B-Chemical
were O
discovered O
with O
proposed O
structures O
of O
DeltaUA2S-GlcNS-IdoUA2S-[(35)S]GlcNH(2)3S B-Chemical
and O
DeltaUA2S-GlcNS-IdoUA2S-[3-(35)S]GlcNH(2)3S6S B-Chemical
. O

The O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
3-OST-3A O
sulfates O
N-unsubstituted O
glucosamine B-Chemical
residues, O
and O
the O
3-OST-3A O
modification O
sites O
are O
probably O
located O
in O
defined O
oligosaccharide B-Chemical
sequences. O
Our O
study O
suggests O
that O
oligosaccharides B-Chemical
with O
N-unsubstituted O
glucosamine B-Chemical
are O
precursors O
for O
sulfation O
by O
3-OST-3A. O
The O
intriguing O
linkage O
between O
N-unsubstituted O
glucosamine B-Chemical
and O
the O
3-O-sulfation O
by O
3-OST-3A O
may O
provide O
a O
clue O
to O
the O
potential O
biological O
functions O
of O
3-OST-3A-modified O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate. I-Chemical
