# Abstract
Peroxisomes O
were O
long O
believed O
to O
play O
only O
a O
minor O
role O
in O
cellular O
metabolism O
but O
it O
is O
now O
clear O
that O
they O
catalyze O
a O
number O
of O
important O
functions. O
The O
importance O
of O
peroxisomes O
in O
humans B-Species
is O
stressed O
by O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
group O
of O
genetic B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
in O
man B-Species
in O
which O
one O
or O
more O
peroxisomal B-Disease
functions O
are O
impaired. O
Most O
of O
the O
functions O
known O
to O
take O
place O
in O
peroxisomes O
have O
to O
do O
with O
lipids. B-Chemical
Indeed, O
peroxisomes O
are O
capable O
of O
1. O
fatty O
acid O
beta-oxidation O
2. O
fatty O
acid O
alpha-oxidation O
3. O
synthesis O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
other O
isoprenoids B-Chemical
4. O
ether-phospholipid B-Chemical
synthesis O
and O
5. O
biosynthesis O
of O
polyunsaturated B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
In O
Chapters O
2-6 O
we O
will O
discuss O
the O
functional O
organization O
and O
enzymology O
of O
these O
pathways O
in O
detail. O
Furthermore, O
attention O
is O
paid O
to O
the O
permeability O
properties O
of O
peroxisomes O
with O
special O
emphasis O
on O
recent O
studies O
which O
suggest O
that O
peroxisomes O
are O
closed O
structures O
containing O
specific O
membrane O
proteins O
for O
transport O
of O
metabolites. O
Finally, O
the O
disorders O
of O
peroxisomal B-Disease
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism O
will O
be O
discussed. O
