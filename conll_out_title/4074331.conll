# Abstract
Human B-Species
kidney O
prolinase, O
assayed O
with O
Pro-Ala, B-Chemical
and O
non-specific O
dipeptidase, O
assayed O
with O
Gly-Leu, B-Chemical
were O
purified O
by O
using O
DEAE-cellulose, O
gel-filtration, O
metal-ion-chelate, O
hydrophobic O
and O
adsorption O
chromatography O
and O
chromatofocusing. O
Both O
enzymes O
gave O
single O
peaks O
of O
activity O
that O
were O
congruent O
and O
the O
ratio O
of O
their O
activities O
was O
constant O
throughout O
the O
purification. O
Gel O
filtration O
indicated O
an O
Mr O
of O
100 O
000 O
and O
chromatofocusing O
a O
pI O
of O
5.4. O
Ni2+-chelate O
chromatography O
demonstrated O
the O
presence O
of O
exposed O
histidine O
residues O
on O
the O
enzyme O
and O
was O
an O
effective O
separative O
procedure. O
Polyacrylamide-gel O
electrophoresis O
of O
the O
final O
preparation O
showed O
the O
two O
enzyme O
activities O
to O
be O
coincident. O
Both O
enzyme O
activities O
decayed O
at O
the O
same O
rate O
at O
53 O
degrees O
C O
and O
were O
inhibited O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
by O
p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. B-Chemical
Of O
six O
non-specific O
dipeptidase O
substrates O
tested O
Gly-Leu B-Chemical
gave O
the O
highest O
activity, O
and O
of O
six O
prolinase O
substrates O
Pro-Leu B-Chemical
had O
the O
highest O
activity. O
Gly-Leu B-Chemical
was O
hydrolysed O
at O
double O
the O
rate O
of O
Pro-Leu. B-Chemical
Pro-Ala B-Chemical
was O
a O
competitive O
inhibitor O
of O
activity O
towards O
Gly-Leu, B-Chemical
and O
Gly-Leu B-Chemical
was O
a O
competitive O
inhibitor O
of O
activity O
towards O
Pro-Ala. B-Chemical
Mixed-substrate O
studies O
strongly O
suggested O
that O
Gly-Leu B-Chemical
and O
Pro-Ala B-Chemical
were O
hydrolysed O
at O
a O
common O
active O
site. O
The O
data O
are O
consistent O
with O
prolinase O
and O
non-specific O
dipeptidase O
activity O
in O
human B-Species
kidney O
being O
due O
to O
a O
single O
enzyme. O
