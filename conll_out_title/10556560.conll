# Abstract
Tetrahydroisoquinolines B-Chemical
(TIQs) B-Chemical
are O
intraneuronal, O
catecholamine-derived O
alkaloids B-Chemical
that O
have O
been O
implicated O
in O
the O
etiology O
of O
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease I-Disease
and O
in O
alcohol B-Chemical
related O
disorders. O
The O

production O
of O
the O
cytotoxic B-Disease
hydroxyl B-Chemical
radical I-Chemical
(*OH) O
was O
recorded O
during O
the O
autoxidation O
of O
salsolinol B-Chemical
(SAL) B-Chemical
and O
salsolinol-1-carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(SAL-1C), B-Chemical
but O
not O
when O
these O
two O
catecholic O
TIQs B-Chemical
were O
oxidized O
by O
tyrosinase. B-Gene
Significantly O
higher O
levels O
of O
the O
radical O
were O
produced O
when O
these O
catecholic O
TIQs B-Chemical
were O

or O

chelated O
iron. B-Chemical
In O
contrast, O
mono-O-methylated O
TIQs B-Chemical
such O
as O
salsoline B-Chemical
(SLN) B-Chemical
and O
salsoline-1-carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical

generate O

Radical O

TIQs. B-Chemical
The O

TIQs B-Chemical
may O
result O
from O
their O

This O
