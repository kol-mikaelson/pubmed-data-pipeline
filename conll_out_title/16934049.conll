# Abstract
AIMS: O
To O
investigate O
the O
association O
between O
torsemide B-Chemical
renal O

and O
genetic O
variation O
in O
the O
basolaterally O

and O
OAT3 B-Gene
and O
in O
the O

situated O
OAT4. B-Gene
METHODS: O
We O
analysed O
22 O
polymorphisms O
in O
the O
OAT O
coding O
genes O
SLC22A6, B-Gene
SLC22A8 B-Gene
and O
SLC22A11 B-Gene
and O
their O
haplotypes O
and O
measured O
torsemide B-Chemical

In O
addition, O
the O
effect O
of O
torsemide B-Chemical
on O
the O
OAT-mediated O
transport O
was O
studied O
in O
