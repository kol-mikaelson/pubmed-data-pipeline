# Abstract
To O
determine O
the O
renal O
localization O
of O
oligopeptide O
transporters, O
Northern O
blot O
analyses O
were O
performed O
and O
polyclonal O
antisera O
were O
generated O
against O
PEPT1 B-Gene
and O
PEPT2, O
the O
two O
cloned O
rat B-Species
H+ O
peptide O
transporters. O
Under O
high-stringency O
conditions, O
a O
3.0-kb O
mRNA O
transcript O
of O
rat B-Species
PEPT1 B-Gene
was O
expressed O
primarily O
in O
superficial O
cortex, O
whereas O
a O
3.5-kb O
mRNA O
transcript O
of O
PEPT2 O
was O
expressed O
primarily O
in O
deep O
cortex O
outer O
stripe O
of O
outer O
medulla. O
PEPT1 B-Gene
antisera O
detected O
a O
specific O
band O
on O
immunoblots O
of O
renal O
and O
intestinal O
brush-border O
membrane O
vesicles O
(BBMV) O
with O
an O
apparent O
mobility O
of O
approximately O
90 O
kDa. O
PEPT2 O
antisera O
detected O
a O
specific O
broad O
band O
of O
approximately O
85 O
kDa O
in O
renal O
but O
not O
in O
intestinal O
BBMV. O
PEPT1 B-Gene
immunolocalization O
experiments O
showed O
detection O
of O
a O
brush O
border O
antigen O
in O
S1 O
segments O
of O
the O
proximal O
tubule O
and O
in O
the O
brush O
border O
of O
villi O
from O
all O
segments O
of O
the O
small O
intestine. O
In O
contrast, O
PEPT2 O
immunolocalization O
was O
primarily O
confined O
to O
the O
brush O
border O
of O
S3 O
segments O
of O
the O
proximal O
tubule. O
All O
other O
nephron O
segments O
in O
rat B-Species
were O
negative O
for O
PEPT1 B-Gene
and O
PEPT2 O
staining. O
Overall, O
our O
results O
conclusively O
demonstrate O
that O
although O
PEPT1 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
early O
regions O
of O
the O
proximal O
tubule O
(pars O
convoluta), O
PEPT2 O
is O
specific O
for O
the O
latter O
regions O
of O
proximal O
tubule O
(pars O
recta). O
