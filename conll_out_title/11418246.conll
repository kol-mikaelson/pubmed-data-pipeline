# Abstract
The O
first O
step O
in O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
(GPI) B-Chemical
membrane O
anchor O
biosynthesis O
that O
is O
defective O
in O
paroxysmal B-Disease
nocturnal I-Disease
haemoglobinuria I-Disease
is O
mediated O
by O
an O
N-acetylglucosaminyl O
transferase O
expressed O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum. O
Six O
human B-Species
genes O
encode O
subunits O
of O
this O
enzyme, O
namely O
PIG-A, B-Gene
PIG-C, B-Gene
PIG-H, B-Gene
PIG-P, B-Gene
GPI1, B-Gene
and O
DPM2. B-Gene
Here, O
the O
human B-Species
GPI1 B-Gene
gene O
is O
characterised. O
This O
gene O
is O
organised O
into O
eleven O
exons. O
The O
locus O
was O
mapped O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
16p13.3 I-Chromosome
near O
the O
haemoglobin O
alpha O
chain O
locus. O
GPI1 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
ubiquitously O
in O
human B-Species
cells O
and O
tissues. O
Expression O
levels O
are O
markedly O
elevated O
in O
haematopoietic O
tissues O
(bone O
marrow, O
foetal O
liver). O
To O
determine O
whether O
human B-Species
GPI1 B-Gene
is O
essential O
for O
human B-Species
GPI B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
antisense O
RNA O
was O
expressed O
in O
HEK293 B-CellLine
cells. O
Transfectants O
exhibited O
a O
marked O
but O
incomplete O
decrease O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
a O
GPI-linked O
reporter O
protein, O
confirming O
that O
GPI1 B-Gene
is O
required O
for O
efficient O
GPI B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
In O
contrast, O
expression O
of O
GPI-linked O
proteins O
is O
normal O
in O
lymphatic O
cell O
lines O
from O
individuals O
with O
the O
alpha B-Disease
thalassaemia I-Disease
mental B-Disease
retardation I-Disease
syndrome, I-Disease
which O
is O
characterised O
by O
large O
deletions O
from O
chromosome O
16p O
removing O
one O
of O
the O
two O
GPI1 B-Gene
alleles O
along O
with O
the O
haemoglobin O
alpha O
locus. O
In O
conclusion, O
GPI1 B-Gene
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
GPI B-Chemical
intermediates. O
Due O
to O
its O
autosomal O
localisation, O
the O
heterozygous O
deletion O
of O
GPI1 B-Gene
does O
not O
lead O
to O
an O
overt O
defect O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
GPI-linked O
proteins. O
