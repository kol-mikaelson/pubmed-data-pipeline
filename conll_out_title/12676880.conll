# Abstract
The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
the O
absorption O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
by O
means O
of O
simultaneous O
perfusion O
of O
intestinal O
lumen O
and O
blood O
vessels O
in O
rats. B-Species
In O
our O
previous O
report, O
the O
permeability O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
was O
found O
to O
be O
higher O
in O
the O
jejunum O
than O
in O
the O
ileum O
or O
colon, O
suggesting O
the O
site-dependent O
absorption O
after O
oral O
administration. O
However, O
in O
this O
article, O
simultaneous O
perfusion O
technique O
revealed O
that O
the O
extent O
of O
absorption O
into O
blood O
vessels O
was O
similar O
in O
the O
jejunum O
and O
the O
ileum O
regardless O
of O
the O
site O
difference O
in O
permeability O
as O
the O
absorption O
rate. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
multidrug O
resistance-associated O
protein-mediated O
efflux, O
cytochrome O
P450 O
(P450)-mediated O
metabolism O
could O
be O
a O
possible O
mechanism O
to O
explain O
the O
inconsistencies O
in O
the O
site O
dependence O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
absorption. O
Two O
enzyme O
inhibitors, O
ketoconazole B-Chemical
and O
midazolam, B-Chemical
were O
coperfused O
in O
rat B-Species
intestinal O
lumen O
with O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
to O
specify O
the O
effect O
of O
P-gp B-Gene
and O
P450. O
In O
the O
jejunum, O
both O
inhibitors O
significantly O
enhanced O
the O
absorbed O
amount O
of O
tacrolimus, B-Chemical
whereas O
the O
permeability O
was O
not O
affected. O
It O
was O
suggested O
that O
both O
inhibitors O
mainly O
suppress O
P450-mediated O
metabolism O
in O
the O
upper O
region O
of O
the O
intestine. O
In O
contrast, O
in O
the O
ileum, O
ketoconazole B-Chemical
significantly O
enhanced O
both O
the O
absorbed O
amount O
and O
the O
permeability O
of O
tacrolimus. B-Chemical
However, O
midazolam B-Chemical
failed O
to O
enhance O
the O
absorption O
of O
tacrolimus, B-Chemical
indicating O
the O
dominant O
role O
of O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
(P-gp)-mediated O
efflux O
in O
the O
lower O
region. O
From O
these O
findings, O
it O
is O
concluded O
that O
the O
site-dependent O
differences O
in O
P-gp B-Gene
and O
or O
P450 O
activity O
could O
be O
the O
prime O
cause O
of O
large O
intra- O
and O
interindividual O
variability O
in O
the O
oral O
absorption O
of O
tacrolimus. B-Chemical
