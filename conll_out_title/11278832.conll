# Abstract
ITP B-Chemical
and O
dITP B-Chemical
exist O
in O
all O
cells. O
dITP B-Chemical
is O
potentially O
mutagenic, O
and O
the O
levels O
of O
these O
nucleotides O
are O
controlled O
by O
inosine B-Gene
triphosphate I-Gene
pyrophosphatase I-Gene
(EC O
). O
Here O
we O
report O
the O
cloning, O
expression, O
and O
characterization O
of O
a O
21.5-kDa O
human B-Species
inosine B-Gene
triphosphate I-Gene
pyrophosphatase I-Gene
(hITPase), O
an O
enzyme O
whose O
activity O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
many O
animal O
tissues O
and O
studied O
in O
populations O
but O

before. O
At O
the O

ITP, B-Chemical
dITP, B-Chemical
and O
xanthosine B-Chemical
5'-triphosphate I-Chemical

monophosphates B-Chemical
whereas O
activity O
with O
other O
nucleoside B-Chemical

was O
low. O
K(m) O
values O
for O
ITP, B-Chemical
dITP, B-Chemical
and O
xanthosine B-Chemical
5'-triphosphate I-Chemical
were O
0.51, O

and O
0.57 O
mm, O
respectively, O
and O
k(cat) O
values O
were O
580, O

s(-1), O
respectively. O
A O
divalent O
cation O
was O
absolutely O

activity. O
The O

the O
hITPase O
cDNA O
sequence O
was O
localized O
by O
radiation O
hybrid O
mapping O

chromosome O
20p O
in O
the O
interval O
D20S113-D20S97, O
the O
same O

in O
which O
the O
ITPA B-Gene
inosine O
triphosphatase O
gene O
was O
previously O
localized. O
A O
BLAST O

the O
existence O
of O
many O

from O

The O

the O
