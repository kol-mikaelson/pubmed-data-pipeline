# Abstract
Many O
eukaryotic O
proteins O
are O
anchored O
by O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
(GPI) B-Chemical
to O
the O
cell O
surface O
membrane. O
The O
GPI B-Chemical
anchor O
is O
linked O
to O
proteins O
by O
an O
amide O
bond O
formed O
between O
the O
carboxyl O
terminus O
and O
phosphoethanolamine B-Chemical
attached O
to O
the O
third O
mannose. B-Chemical
Here, O
we O
report O
the O
roles O
of O
two O
mammalian O
genes O
involved O
in O
transfer O
of O
phosphoethanolamine B-Chemical
to O
the O
third O
mannose B-Chemical
in O
GPI. B-Chemical
We O
cloned O
a O
mouse B-Species
gene O
termed O
Pig-o B-Gene
that O
encodes O
a O
1101-amino O
acid O
PIG-O B-Gene
protein O
bearing O
regions O
conserved O
in O
various O
phosphodiesterases. O
Pig-o B-Gene

cells O

GPI-anchored O
proteins O
and O
accumulated O
the O
same O
major O
GPI B-Chemical
intermediate O
as O
the O
mouse B-Species
class O
F O
mutant O
cell, O
which O
is O
defective O
in O
transferring O
phosphoethanolamine B-Chemical
to O
the O
third O
mannose B-Chemical
due O
to O
mutant O
Pig-f B-Gene
gene. O
PIG-O B-Gene
and O
PIG-F B-Gene
proteins O
associate O
with O
each O
other, O
and O
the O
stability O
of O
PIG-O B-Gene
was O
dependent O
upon O
PIG-F. B-Gene
However, O
the O
class O
F O
cell O
is O
completely O
deficient O
in O
the O
surface O
expression O
of O
GPI-anchored O
proteins. O
A O
minor O
GPI B-Chemical
intermediate O
seen O
in O
Pig-o B-Gene
knockout O
but O
not O
class O
F O
cells O
had O
more O
than O
three O
mannoses B-Chemical
with O
phosphoethanolamines B-Chemical
on O
the O
first O
and O
third O
mannoses, B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
this O
GPI B-Chemical
may O
account O
for O
the O
low O
expression O
of O
GPI-anchored O
proteins. O
Therefore, O
mammalian O
cells O
have O
redundant O
activities O
in O
transferring O
phosphoethanolamine B-Chemical
to O
the O
third O
mannose, B-Chemical
both O
of O
which O
require O
PIG-F. B-Gene
