# Abstract
A O
cDNA O
for O
a O
second O
mouse B-Species
mitochondrial O
carbonic O
anhydrase O
(CA) O
called O
CA B-Gene
VB I-Gene
was O
identified O
by O
homology O
to O
the O
previously O
characterized O
murine B-Species
CA B-Gene
V, I-Gene
now O
called O
CA B-Gene
VA. I-Gene
The O
full-length O
cDNA O
encodes O
a O
317-aa O
precursor O
that O
contains O
a O
33-aa O
classical O
mitochondrial O
leader O
sequence. O
Comparison O

that O
both O

CA B-Gene
VA. I-Gene
CA B-Gene
VB I-Gene
was O
readily O
detected O
in O
most O
tissues, O
while O
CA B-Gene
VA I-Gene
expression O
was O
limited O
to O
liver, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
and O
kidney. O
The O
human B-Species
orthologue O
of O
murine B-Species
CA B-Gene
VB I-Gene
was O
recently O
reported O
also. O
Comparison O
of O
the O
CA O
domain O
sequence O
of O
human B-Species
CA B-Gene
VB I-Gene
with O
that O
reported O
here O
shows O
that O
the O
CA O
domains O
of O
CA B-Gene
VB I-Gene
are O
much O
more O
highly O
conserved O
between O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
(95% O
identity) O
than O
the O
CA O
domains O
of O
mouse B-Species

human B-Species

(78% O
identity). O
Analysis O
of O
phylogenetic O
relationships O
between O
these O
and O
other O
available O
human B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
CA O

sequences O
revealed O
that O
mammalian B-Species
CA B-Gene
VB I-Gene
evolved O
much O
more O
slowly O
than O
CA B-Gene
VA, I-Gene
accepting O
amino O
acid O
substitutions O
at O
least O
4.5 O
times O
more O
slowly O
since O
each O
evolved O
from O
its O
respective O
human-mouse O
ancestral O

around O
90 O
million O

ago. O

have O
evolved O
