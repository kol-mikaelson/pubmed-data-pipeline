# Abstract
Uncoupling O
protein-3 O
(UCP3) B-Gene
is O
a O
mitochondrial O
inner O
membrane O
protein O
expressed O
most O
abundantly O
in O
skeletal O
muscle O
and O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
in O
heart O
and O
brown O
adipose O
tissue. O
Evidence O
supports O
a O
role O
for O
UCP3 B-Gene
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
(FAO); O
however, O
the O
underlying O
mechanism O
has O
not O
been O
explored. O
In O
2001 O
we O
proposed O
a O
role O
for O
UCP3 B-Gene
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
export, O
leading O
to O
higher O
FAO O
rates O
(Himms-Hagen, O
J., O
and O
Harper, O
M. O

(2001) O

78-84). O
Specifically, O
this O
widely O
held O
hypothesis O
states O
that O
during O
elevated O
FAO O
rates, O
UCP3 B-Gene
exports O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
anions, I-Chemical
thereby O
maintaining O

availability; O
reactivation O
of O
exported O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
anions I-Chemical
would O
ultimately O
enable O
increased O
FAO. O
Here O
we O
tested O
mechanistic O
aspects O
of O
this O
hypothesis O
as O
well O
as O
its O
functional O
implications, O
namely O
increased O
FAO O
rates. O
Using O
complementary O
mechanistic O
approaches O
in O
mitochondria O
from O
wild-type O
and O
Ucp3(- B-Gene
-) O
mice, B-Species
we O
find O
that O
UCP3 B-Gene
is O
not O
required O
for O
FAO O
regardless O
of O
substrate O
type O
or O
supply O
rate O
covering O
a O
20-fold O
range. O
Fatty B-Chemical

export O
and O
reoxidation O
during O
elevated O
FAO, O
although O
present O
in O
skeletal O
muscle O
mitochondria, O
are O
independent O
of O
UCP3 B-Gene
abundance. O
Interestingly, O
UCP3 B-Gene
was O
found O
to O
be O
necessary O
for O
the O
fasting-induced O
enhancement O
of O
FAO O
rate O
and O
capacity, O
possibly O
via O
mitigated O
mitochondrial O
oxidative O
stress. O
Thus, O
although O
our O
observations O
indicate O
that O
UCP3 B-Gene
can O
impact O
FAO O
rates, O
the O
mechanistic O
basis O
is O
not O
via O
an O
integral O
function O
for O
UCP3 B-Gene
in O
the O
FAO O
machinery. O
Overall O
our O
data O
indicate O
a O
function O
for O
UCP3 B-Gene
in O
mitochondrial O
adaptation O
to O
perturbed O
cellular O
energy O
balance O
and O
integrate O
previous O
observations O
that O
have O
linked O
UCP3 B-Gene
to O
reduced O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
FAO. O
