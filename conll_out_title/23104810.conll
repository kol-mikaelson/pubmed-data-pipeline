# Abstract
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
has O
been O
used O
as O
a O
platform O
host O
for O
studying O
the O
production O
of O
free B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(FFA) B-Chemical
and O
other O
energy-dense O
compounds O
useful O
in O
biofuel O
applications. O
Most O
of O
the O
FFA B-Chemical
produced O
by O
E. B-Species
coli I-Species
are O
found O
extracellularly. O
This O
finding O
suggests O
that O
a O
mechanism O
for O
transport O
across O
the O
cell O
envelope O
exists, O
yet O
knowledge O
of O
proteins O
that O
may O
be O
responsible O
for O
export O
remains O
incomplete. O
Production O
of O
FFA B-Chemical
has O
been O
shown O
to O
cause O
cell O
lysis, O
induce O
stress O
responses, O
and O
impair O
basic O
physiological O
processes. O
These O
phenotypes O
could O
potentially O
be O
diminished O
if O
efflux O
rates O
were O
increased. O
Here, O
a O
total O
of O
15 O
genes O
and O
operons O
were O
deleted O
and O
screened O
for O
their O
impact O
on O
cell O
viability O
and O
titer O
in O
FFA-producing O
E. B-Species

Deletions O
of O
acrAB O
and O

and, O
to O
a O
lower O
degree O
of O
statistical O
confidence, O
emrAB, O
mdtEF, O
and O
mdtABCD O
reduced O
multiple O
measures O
of O
viability, O
while O
deletion O
of O
tolC O
nearly O
abolished O
FFA B-Chemical
production. O
An O
acrAB O
emrAB O
deletion O
strain O
exhibited O
greatly O
reduced O
FFA B-Chemical
titers O
approaching O
the O
tolC O
deletion O
phenotype. O
Expression O
of O
efflux O
pumps O
on O
multicopy O
plasmids O
did O
not O
improve O
endogenous O
FFA B-Chemical
production O
in O
an O
acrAB(+) O
strain, O
but O
plasmid-based O
expression O
of O
acrAB, O
mdtEF, O
and O
an O
mdtEF-tolC O
artificial O
operon O
improved O
the O
MIC O
of O
exogenously O
added O
decanoate B-Chemical
for O
an O
acrAB O
mutant O
strain. O
The O
findings O
suggest O
that O
AcrAB-TolC O
is O
responsible O
for O
most O
of O
the O
FFA B-Chemical
efflux O
in O
E. B-Species
coli, I-Species
with O
residual O
activity O
provided O
by O
other O
resistance-nodulation-cell O
division O
superfamily-type O
efflux O
pumps, O
including O
EmrAB-TolC O
and O
MdtEF-TolC. O
While O
the O
expression O
of O
these O
proteins O
on O
multicopy O
plasmids O
did O
not O
improve O
production O
over O
the O
basal O
level, O
their O
identification O
enables O
future O
engineering O
efforts. O
