# Abstract
The O
Na(+)-driven O
Cl(-) O
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical
exchanger O
is O
an O
important O
regulator O
of O
intracellular O
pH O
in O
various O
cells, O
but O
its O
molecular O
basis O
has O
not O
been O
determined. O
We O
show O
here O
the O
primary O
structure, O
tissue O
distribution, O
and O
functional O
characterization O
of O
Na(+)-driven O
chloride O
bicarbonate O
exchanger O
(designated O
NCBE) B-Gene
cloned O
from O
the O
insulin-secreting O
cell O
line O
MIN6 B-CellLine
cDNA O
library. O
The O
NCBE B-Gene
protein O
consists O
of O
1088 O
amino O
acids O
having O
74, O
72, O
and O
55% O
amino O
acid O
identity O
to O
the O
human B-Species
skeletal O
muscle, O
rat B-Species
smooth O
muscle, O
and O
human B-Species
kidney O
sodium O
bicarbonate O
cotransporter, O
respectively. O
The O
protein O
has O
10 O
putative O
membrane-spanning O
regions. O
NCBE B-Gene
mRNA O
is O
expressed O
at O
high O
levels O
in O
the O
brain O
and O
the O
mouse B-Species
insulinoma B-Disease
cell O
line O
MIN6 B-CellLine
and O
at O
low O
levels O
in O
the O
pituitary, O
testis, O
kidney, O
and O
ileum. O
Functional O
analyses O
of O
the O
NCBE B-Gene
protein O
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
and O
HEK293 B-CellLine
cells O
demonstrate O
that O
it O
transports O
extracellular O
Na(+) O
and O
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical
into O
cells O
in O
exchange O
for O
intracellular O
Cl(-) O
and O
H(+), O
thus O
raising O
the O
intracellular O
pH. O
Thus, O
we O
conclude O
that O
NCBE B-Gene
is O
a O
Na(+)-driven O
Cl(-) O
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical
exchanger O
that O
regulates O
intracellular O
pH O
in O
native O
cells. O
