# Abstract
At O
least O
three O
different O
subcellular O
compartments, O
including O
peroxisomes, O
are O
involved O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
synthesis. O
The O
peroxisomal O
targeting O
signals O
for O
phosphomevalonate B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
and O
isopentenyl O
diphosphate O
isomerase O
have O
been O
identified. O
In O
the O
current O
study O
we O
identify O
the O
peroxisomal O
targeting O
signals O
required O
for O
four O
other O
enzymes O
of O
the O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthetic O
pathway: O
acetoacetyl-CoA B-Gene
(AA-CoA) I-Gene
thiolase, I-Gene
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme B-Gene
A I-Gene
(HMG-CoA) B-Gene
synthase, I-Gene
mevalonate B-Gene
diphosphate I-Gene
decarboxylase I-Gene
(MPPD), B-Gene
and O
farnesyl B-Gene
diphosphate I-Gene
(FPP) B-Gene
synthase. I-Gene
Data O
are O
presented O
that O
demonstrate O
that O
mitochondrial O
AA-CoA O
thiolase O
contains O
both O
a O
mitochondrial O
targeting O
signal O
at O
the O
amino O
terminus O
and O
a O
peroxisomal O
targeting O
signal O
(PTS-1) O
at O
the O
carboxy O
terminus. O
We O
also O
analyze O
a O
new O
variation O
of O
PTS-2 O
sequences O
required O
to O
target O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
and O
MPPD B-Gene
to O
peroxisomes. O
In O
addition, O
we O
show O
that O
FPP B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
import O
into O
peroxisomes O
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
PTS-2 B-Gene
receptor I-Gene
and O
identify O
at O
the O
amino O
terminus O
of O
the O
protein O
a O
20-amino O
acid O
region O
that O
is O
required O
for O
the O
peroxisomal O
localization O
of O
the O
enzyme. O
These O
data O
provide O
further O
support O
for O
the O
conclusion O
that O
peroxisomes O
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
