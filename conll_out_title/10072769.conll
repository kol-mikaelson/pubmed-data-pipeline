# Abstract
We O
have O
developed O
a O
simple O
method O
to O
test O
whether O
a O
hydrophobic O
segment O
near O
the O
N-terminus O
of O
a O
protein O
functions O
as O
a O
type O
II O
signal O
anchor O
(SA) O
in O
which O
the O
N-terminus O
faces O
the O
cytoplasm. O
A O
cDNA O
fragment O
containing O
the O
putative O
SA O
sequence O
of O
a O
target O
clone O
was O
fused O
in-frame O
to O
the O
5' O
end O
of O
a O
cDNA O
fragment O
encoding O
the O
protease O
domain O
of O
urokinase-type B-Gene
plasminogen I-Gene
activator I-Gene
(u-PA). B-Gene
The O
resulting O
fused O
gene O
was O
expressed O
in O
COS7 B-CellLine
cells. O
Fibrinolytic O
activity O
on O
the O
cell O
surface O
was O
measured O
by O
placing O
a O
fibrin O
sheet O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
transfected O
COS7 B-CellLine
cells O
after O
removing O
the O
medium. O
When O
the O
cDNA O
fragment O
encoded O
a O
SA, O
the O
fibrin O
sheet O
was O
lysed O
by O
the O
u-PA B-Gene
expressed O
on O
the O
cell O
surface. O
The O
fibrinolytic O
activity O
was O
not O
detected O
in O
the O
culture O
medium, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
u-PA B-Gene
remains O
on O
the O
cell O
surface O
anchored O
via O
the O
SA O
in O
the O
membrane O
without O
being O
cleaved O
by O
signal O
peptidase. O
This O
fibrin O
sheet O
method O
was O
successfully O
applied O
to O
select O
five O
novel O
cDNA O
clones O
encoding O
putative O
type O
II O
membrane O
proteins O
from O
a O
human B-Species
