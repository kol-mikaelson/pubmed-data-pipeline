# Abstract
The O
effect O
of O
various O
amino O
acids O
and O
MnCl2 B-Chemical
on O
prolinase O
activity O
in O
erythrocyte O
lysates O
from O
a O
healthy O
individual O
and O
a O
patient B-Species
with O
prolidase B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
was O
investigated. O
A O
concentration O
of O
0.1 O
mM O
MnCl2 B-Chemical
increased O
prolinase O
activity O
in O
normal O
erythrocytes O
against O
pro-gly, B-Chemical
pro-glu, O
pro-leu, O
pro-ser O
and O
pro-phe, O
but O
inhibited O
that O
against O
pro-ala, O
pro-val, O
pro-met O
and O
pro-asp. O
However, O
prolinase O
activity O
against O
these O
iminodipeptides B-Chemical
was O
enhanced O
by O
pre-incubation O
with O
glycine, B-Chemical
independent O
of O
MnCl2. B-Chemical
The O
same O
studies O
on O
erythrocytes O
from O
a O
prolidase-deficient B-Disease
patient B-Species
showed O
almost O
the O
same O
results O
as O
the O
normal O
control, O
except O
that O
prolinase O
activity O
against O
pro-gly B-Chemical
and O
pro-ser O
was O
slightly O
inhibited O
by O
adding O
0.1 O
mM O
MnCl2. B-Chemical
Some O
amino O
acids, O
glutamic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
glutamine, B-Chemical
slightly O
enhanced O
prolinase O
activity O
against O
pro-gly B-Chemical
in O
erythrocytes O
from O
both O
the O
normal O
control O
and O
the O
prolidase-deficient B-Disease
patient, B-Species
but O
N-acetyl-L-glutamic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
gamma-aminobutyric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(GABA) B-Chemical
and O
beta-alanine B-Chemical
showed O
no O
effect. O
Branched B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
L-valine, B-Chemical
L-leucine B-Chemical
and O
L-isoleucine B-Chemical
strongly O
inhibited O
the O
prolinase O
activity O
against O
pro-gly. B-Chemical
However, O
conversely, O
their O
isomers, O
D-valine, B-Chemical
D-leucine B-Chemical
and O
D-isoleucine, B-Chemical
enhanced O
it. O
The O
kinetics O
of O
prolinase O
activity O
in O
the O
erythrocytes O
from O
both O
the O
normal O
individual O
and O
the O
prolidasedeficient B-Disease
patient B-Species
were O
also O
studied. O
Their O
Km O
values O
were O
changed O
by O
adding O
glycine B-Chemical
or O
0.1 O
mM O
MnCl2, B-Chemical
but O
Vmax O
values O
were O
almost O
the O
same. O
