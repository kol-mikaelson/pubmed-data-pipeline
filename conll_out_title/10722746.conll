# Abstract
Chondroitin B-Chemical
4-sulfotransferase O
(C4ST) B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
transfer O
of O
sulfate B-Chemical
from O
3'-phosphoadenosine B-Chemical
5'-phosphosulfate I-Chemical
to O
position O
4 O
of O
N-acetylgalactosamine B-Chemical
residue O
of O
chondroitin. B-Chemical
The O
enzyme O
has O
been O
previously O
purified O
to O
apparent O
homogeneity O
from O
the O
serum-free O

We O
have O
now O
cloned O
the O
cDNA O
of O
the O
mouse B-Species
C4ST B-Gene
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
amino O

sequences O
of O
peptides O
obtained O
from O
the O
purified O
enzyme O
by O

This O
cDNA O
contains O
a O
single O
open O
reading O
frame O
that O
predicts O
a O
protein O
composed O
of O
352 O
amino O
acid O
residues. O
The O
protein O
predicts O
a O
Type O
II O
transmembrane O
topology. O
The O
predicted O
sequence O
of O
the O
protein O
contains O
all O
of O
the O
known O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
and O
four O
potential O
sites O
for O
N-glycosylation, O
which O
corresponds O
to O
the O
observation O
that O
the O
purified O
C4ST B-Gene
is O
an O
N-linked O
glycoprotein. O
The O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
of O
mouse B-Species
C4ST B-Gene
showed O
significant O
sequence O
homology O
to O
HNK-1 B-Gene
sulfotransferase. I-Gene
Comparison O
of O
the O
sequence O
of O
mouse B-Species
C4ST B-Gene
with O
human B-Species
HNK-1 B-Gene
sulfotransferase I-Gene
revealed O
approximately O
29% O
identity O
and O
approximately O
48% O
similarity O
at O
the O
amino O
acid O
level. O
When O
the O
cDNA O
was O
introduced O
in O
a O
eukaryotic O
expression O
vector O
and O
transfected O
in O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells, O
the O

of O
GalNAc B-Chemical
residue O
of O
both O
chondroitin B-Chemical

desulfated I-Chemical
dermatan I-Chemical
