# Abstract
We O
have O
cloned O
a O
novel O
inositol B-Chemical
polyphosphate I-Gene
5-phosphatase I-Gene
from O
the O
rat B-Species
brain O
cDNA O
library. O
It O
contains O
two O
highly O
conserved O
5-phosphatase O
motifs, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
essential O
for O
its O
enzymatic O
activity. O
Interestingly, O
the O
proline O
content O
of O
this O
protein O
is O
high O
and O
concentrated O
in O
its O
N- O
and O
C-terminal O
regions. O
One O
putative O
SH3-binding O
motif O
and O
six O
14-3-3 O
zeta-binding O
motifs O
were O
found O
in O
the O
amino O
acid O
sequence. O
This O
enzyme O
hydrolyzed O
phosphate B-Chemical
at O
the O
D-5 O
position O
of O
inositol B-Chemical
1,4,5-trisphosphate, I-Chemical
inositol B-Chemical
1,3,4, I-Chemical
5-tetrakisphosphate, I-Chemical
and O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
4,5-bisphosphate, I-Chemical
consistent O
with O
the O
substrate O
specificity O
of O
type O
II O
5-phosphatase, O
OCRL, B-Gene
synaptojanin O
and O
synaptojanin B-Gene
2, I-Gene
already O
characterized O
5-phosphatases. O
When O
the O
Myc-epitope-tagged O
enzyme O
was O
expressed O
in O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells O
and O
stained O
with O
anti-Myc O
polyclonal O
antibody, O
a O
signal O
was O
observed O
at O
ruffling O
membranes O
and O
in O
the O
cytoplasm. O
We O
prepared O
several O
deletion O
mutants O
and O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
123 O
N-terminal O
amino O
acids O
(311-433) O
and O
a O
C-terminal O
proline-rich O
region O
containing O
277 O
amino O
acids O
(725-1001) O
were O
essential O
for O
its O
localization O
to O
ruffling O
membranes. O
This O
enzyme O
might O
regulate O
the O
level O
of O
inositol B-Chemical
and O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
polyphosphates I-Chemical
at O
membrane O
ruffles. O
