# Abstract
A O
variant O
of O
a O
low O
density O
lipoprotein O
receptor-negative O
Chinese B-CellLine
hamster I-CellLine
ovary I-CellLine
(CHO) B-CellLine
cell O
mutant O
was O
isolated O
using O
a O
nutritional O
selection O
called O
MeLoCo. O
The O
variant, O
designated O
met-18b-2, B-CellLine
internalized O
and O
metabolized O
mevalonate B-Chemical
at O
rates O
10-40 O
times O
greater O
than O
the O
progenitor O
cells O
from O
which O
they O
were O
derived. O
The O
extent O
of O
incorporation O
of O
radioactivity O
from O
[3H]mevalonate B-Chemical
into O
steroidal O
and O
nonsteroidal O
mevalonate B-Chemical
derivatives, O
including O
modified O
proteins, O
was O
much O
greater O
in O
met-18b-2 B-CellLine
cells O
than O
in O
their O
progenitors. O
Much O
of O
the O
internalized O
[3H]mevalonate B-Chemical
was O
converted O
to O
nonpolar O
lipids. B-Chemical
Unlike O
wild O
type O
CHO B-CellLine
cells O
or O
the O
receptor-negative O
progenitors, O
met-18b-2 B-CellLine
cells O
were O
killed O
by O
high O
concentrations O
of O
mevalonate B-Chemical
(greater O
than O
6 O
mM) O
in O
the O
culture O
medium. O
Regulation O
of O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
activity O
and O
cholesterol B-Chemical
esterification O
was O
dramatically O
more O
sensitive O
to O
mevalonate B-Chemical
in O
met-18b-2 B-CellLine
cells O
than O
in O
progenitor O
cells. O
In O
cell O
extracts, O
both O
the O
rates O
of O
conversion O
of O
[3H]mevalonate B-Chemical
to O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
mevalonate B-Chemical
kinase I-Gene
activities O
were O
similar O
for O
met-18b-2 B-CellLine
and O
progenitor O
cells. O
In O
contrast O
to O
progenitor O
cells, O
met-18b-2 B-CellLine
cells O
internalized O
[3H]mevalonate B-Chemical
with O
high O
capacity O
(Km O
approximately O
0.3 O
mM) O
kinetics. O
The O
increased O
uptake O
of O
[3H]mevalonate B-Chemical
was O
temperature O
dependent O
and O
highly O
specific. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
met-18b-2 B-CellLine
cells O
express O
a O
mevalonate B-Chemical
transport O
activity O
that O
is O
not O
normally O
expressed O
by O
CHO B-CellLine
cells. O
This O
activity O
may O
be O
due O
to O
a O
specific O
mevalonate B-Chemical
transporter O
that O
is O
differentially O
expressed O
in O
specialized O
tissues. O
Because O
intracellular O
mevalonate B-Chemical
in O
met-18b-2 B-CellLine
cells O
can O
be O
labeled O
to O
high O
specific O
activity, O
these O
cells O
should O
prove O
very O
useful O
in O
further O
characterizing O
the O
structures O
of O
mevalonate B-Chemical
derivatives O
and O
their O
metabolism. O
