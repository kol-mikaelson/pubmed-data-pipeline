# Abstract
All O
current O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA O
reductase O
inhibitors O
[simvastatin B-Chemical
(SV), B-Chemical
lovastatin B-Chemical
(LV), B-Chemical
atorvastatin, B-Chemical
pravastatin, B-Chemical
fluvastatin, B-Chemical
and O
cerivastatin] B-Chemical

believed O
to O
undergo O
an O
atypical O
beta-oxidation O
of O
the O
dihydroxy B-Chemical
heptanoic I-Chemical
or I-Chemical
heptanoic I-Chemical

chain. O
Metabolites, O
which O
are O
shortened O
by O
two- O
and O
or O
four-carbon O
units O
consistent O
with O
beta-oxidation O
products, O
have O
been O
reported O
exclusively O
in O
rodents O
following O
LV B-Chemical
and O
SV B-Chemical
administration O
and O
across O
species O
(rodents, O
dogs, B-Species
and O
humans) B-Species

In O
this O
study, O
in O

formation O
of O
a O
beta-oxidation O

Incubation O
of O
SVA B-Chemical
with O
mouse B-Species
liver O
preparations O
fortified O
with O
CoASH B-Chemical
and O
ATP B-Chemical
led O
to O
formation O
of O
SV B-Chemical
and O
two O
major O
products O
(P1 B-Chemical
and O
P2). B-Chemical
Based O
on O
mass O

(MS), O
tandem O

P1 B-Chemical
was O
an O
alpha,beta-unsaturated B-Chemical
metabolite, O
formed O
by O
dehydration O
of O
the O
D,D-dihydroxy B-Chemical
heptanoic I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
side O
chain, O
whereas O
P2 B-Chemical
was O
probably O
the O
L,D-dihydroxy B-Chemical

When O

In O

(P5) B-Chemical
detected O
in O
rats B-Species
and O
mice B-Species
following O
simvastatin B-Chemical
administration. O
The O
involvement O
of O
CoASH B-Chemical
and O
NAD(+) B-Chemical
and O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
four O
metabolic O
intermediates O
suggest O
that O
SVA B-Chemical
(and O
presumably O
the O
other O
statins) O
is O
a O
substrate O
for O
the O
beta-oxidation O
enzyme O
complex O
in O
mice. B-Species
Additionally, O
the O
present O
finding O
of O
CoASH-dependent O
formation O
of O

substantiates O
a O

proposed O
previously O
for O
