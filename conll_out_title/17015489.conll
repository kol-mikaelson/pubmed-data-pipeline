# Abstract
This O
review O
summarizes O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
cellular O
cholesterol B-Chemical
transport O
and O
monogenic O
human B-Species
diseases O
caused O
by O
defects O
in O
intracellular O
cholesterol B-Chemical
processing. O
In O
addition, O
selected O
mouse B-Species
models O
of O
disturbed O
cholesterol B-Chemical
trafficking O
are O
discussed. O
Current O
pharmacological O
strategies O
to O
prevent O
atherosclerosis B-Disease
are O
largely O
based O
on O
altering O
cellular O
cholesterol B-Chemical
balance O
and O
are O
introduced O
in O
this O
context. O
Finally, O
because O
of O
the O
organizing O
potential O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
in O
membranes, O
disturbances O
in O
cellular O
cholesterol B-Chemical
transport O
have O
implications O
for O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
human B-Species
diseases, O
of O
which O
selected O
examples O
are O
given. O
