# Abstract
Isolated O
human B-Species
hepatocytes O
provide O
a O
useful O
model O
for O
studying O
xenobiotic O
metabolism. O
However, O
in O
vitro O
studies O
using O
human B-Species
hepatocytes O
are O
scarce O
due O
to O
the O
limited O
availability O
of O
this O
material. O
A O
new O
methodology O
is O
described O
for O
obtaining O
hepatocytes O
from O
a O
whole O
adult O
human B-Species
liver. O
This O
procedure O
is O
based O
on O

the O

The O

has O

particularly O
investigated O
using O
the O
benzodiazepine B-Chemical

midazolam, B-Chemical

a O

Freshly O

human B-Species

the O
ability O
to O
metabolize O
midazolam B-Chemical

its O

hydroxylated O
derivatives--mainly O
the O
1-hydroxy-midazolam--which O
was O
further O
conjugated O
with O
glucuronic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
For O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
the O
cytochrome B-Gene
P-450 I-Gene
mediated O
reactions, O
we O
studied O
the O
metabolism O
of O
midazolam B-Chemical
in O
microsomal O
fractions O
prepared O
from O
twelve O
human B-Species
livers. O
It O
was O

that O
human B-Species

exhibited O

Furthermore, O

we O
demonstrated O
that O
midazolam B-Chemical

we O
