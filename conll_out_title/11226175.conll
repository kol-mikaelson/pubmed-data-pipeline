# Abstract
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
(GPI) B-Chemical
acts O
as O
a O
membrane O
anchor O
of O
many O
cell O
surface O
proteins. O
Its O
structure O
and O
biosynthetic O
pathway O
are O
generally O
conserved O
among O
eukaryotic O
organisms, O
with O
a O
number O
of O
differences. O
In O
particular, O
mammalian B-Species
and O
protozoan O
mannosyltransferases O
needed O
for O
addition O
of O
the O
first O
mannose B-Chemical
(GPI-MT-I) B-Gene
have O
different O
substrate O
specificities O
and O
are O
targets O
of O
species- O
specific O
inhibitors O
of O
GPI B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
GPI-MT-I, B-Gene
however, O
has O
not O
been O
molecularly O
characterized. O
Characterization O
of O
GPI-MT-I B-Gene
would O
also O
help O
to O
clarify O
the O
topology O
of O
GPI B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
Here, O
we O
report O
a O
human B-Species
cell O
line O
defective O
in O
GPI-MT-I B-Gene
and O
the O
gene O
responsible, O
PIG-M. B-Gene
PIG-M B-Gene
encodes O
a O
new O
type O
of O
mannosyltransferase O
of O
423 O
amino O
acids, O
bearing O
multiple O
transmembrane O
domains. O
PIG-M B-Gene
has O
a O
functionally O
important O
DXD O
motif, O
a O
characteristic O
of O
many O
glycosyltransferases, O
within O
a O
domain O
facing O
the O
lumen O
of O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
(ER), O
indicating O
that O
transfer O
of O
the O
first O
mannose B-Chemical
to O
GPI B-Chemical
occurs O
on O
the O
lumenal O
side O
of O
the O

membrane. O
