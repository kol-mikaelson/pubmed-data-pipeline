# Abstract
PDE3A B-Gene
cyclic O
nucleotide O
phosphodiesterases O
regulate O
cAMP- B-Chemical
and O
cGMP-mediated O
intracellular O
signaling O
in O
cardiac O
myocytes. O
We O
used O
antibodies O
to O
different O
regions O
of O
PDE3A B-Gene
to O
demonstrate O
the O
presence O
of O
three O
PDE3A B-Gene
isoforms O
in O
these O
cells. O
These O
isoforms, O
whose O
apparent O
molecular O
weights O
are O
136,000, O
118,000, O
and O
94,000 O
("PDE3A-136," O
"PDE3A-118," O
and O
"PDE3A-94"), O
are O
identical O

two O
membrane-association O

protein B-Gene

B I-Gene
("PK-B") B-Gene
and O
protein O
kinase O
A O
("PK-A"). O
PDE3A-136 O
contains O
both O
membrane-association O
domains O
and O
the O
PK-B B-Gene
and O
PK-A O
sites. O
PDE3A-118 O
contains O
only O
the O
downstream O
membrane-association O
domain O
and O
the O
PK-A O
sites. O
PDE3A-94 O
lacks O
both O
membrane O
localization O
domains O
and O
the O
PK-B B-Gene
and O
PK-A O
sites. O
The O
three O
isoforms O
are O
translated O
from O
two O
mRNAs O
derived O
from O
the O
PDE3A1 O
gene: O
PDE3A-136 O
is O
translated O
from O
PDE3A1 O
mRNA, O
whereas O
PDE3A-118 O
and O
PDE3A-94 O
are O
translated O
from O
PDE3A2 O
mRNA. O
Experiments O
involving O
in O
vitro O
transcription O
translation O
indicate O
that O
PDE3A-118 O
and O
PDE3A-94 O
may O
be O
translated O
from O
different O
AUGs O
in O
PDE3A2 O
mRNA. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
alternative O
transcriptional O
and O
post-transcriptional O
processing O
of O
the O
PDE3A B-Gene
gene O
results O

and O
three O
protein O

differ O
with O

to O
intracellular O
localization O
and O
may O
be O
regulated O
through O
different O
signaling O
pathways. O
