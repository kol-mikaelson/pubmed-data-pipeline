METHODS: O
Carnitine B-Chemical

acylcarnitines B-Chemical
were O
isolated O

ion-exchange O
solid-phase O
extraction, O
derivatized O

Carnitine B-Chemical
was O
quantified O
with O
d(3)-carnitine B-Chemical
as O
the O
internal O
standard. O
Acylcarnitines B-Chemical
were O
quantified O
with O
42 O
synthesized O
calibrators. O
The O
internal O
standards O
used O
were O
d(6)-acetyl-, B-Chemical
d(3)-propionyl-, I-Chemical
undecanoyl-, I-Chemical
undecanedioyl-, I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
heptadecanoylcarnitine. I-Chemical
