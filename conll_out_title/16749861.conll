and O
-24G, B-Chemical
and O
HDCA-6G B-Chemical

The O
position O
of O
the O
glucuronosyl O
moiety O
on O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
was O
determined O
by O
analyzing O
the O
susceptibility O
to O
hydrolysis O
under O
elevated O
pH O
and O
temperature O
conditions O
of O
the O
standards. O
By O
using O
the O
purified O
analytical O
standards, O
a O
LC-ESI O
MS O
MS O
method O
was O
developed O
for O
the O
determination O
of O
these O
glucuronide B-Chemical
conjugates O
in O
in O

assays. O
The O
linearity O
of O
the O
assay O
ranged O
from O
0.5 O
to O
40 O
ng O
mL O
for O
the O
six O
glucuronides, B-Chemical
and O
the O
limit O
of O
quantification O
(LOQ) O
was O
0.5 O

Intra- O
and O
interday O
precisions O
and O
accuracy O
values O
were O
all O
lower O
than O
10.2%. O
Furthermore, O
processed O
sample O

analyses O
revealed O
that O
the O
six O
standards O
were O
stable O
at O
4 O
degrees O

This O
method O
was O
successfully O
used O
for O
the O
quantification O
of O
CDCA, B-Chemical
LCA, O
and O
HDCA B-Chemical
glucuronides I-Chemical
formed O
by O
human B-Species

In O
conclusion, O
such O
a O
method O
allows O
the O
purification O
of O
high-quality O
analytical O
standards O
of O
glucuronide B-Chemical
derivatives O
and O
may O
easily O
be O
used O
for O
the O
quantification O
