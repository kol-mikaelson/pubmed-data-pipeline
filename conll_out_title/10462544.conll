# Abstract
Phosphorylation O
of O
deoxycytidine B-Chemical
analogs O
by O
cellular O
enzymes O
is O
a O
prerequisite O
for O
the O
activity O
of O
these O
compounds. O
We O
have O
investigated O
the O
kinetic O
parameters O
for O
the O
phosphorylation O
of O
1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine B-Chemical
(araC) B-Chemical
and O
2', B-Chemical
2'-difluorodeoxycytidine I-Chemical
(dFdC) B-Chemical
to O
their O
diphosphate O
forms O
catalyzed O
by O
human B-Species
UMP-CMP B-Gene
kinase. I-Gene
We O
cloned O

this O
enzyme O
to O
enable O
characterization O
of O
the O
recombinant O
protein, O
determine O
its O
expression O
in O
different O
tissues, O
and O
determine O
the O
chromosome O
location O
of O
the O
gene. O
We O
showed O
that O
the O
recombinant O
UMP-CMP B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
phosphorylated O
CMP, B-Chemical
dCMP, B-Chemical
and O
UMP B-Chemical
with O
highest O
efficiency O
and O
dUMP, B-Chemical
AMP, B-Chemical
and O
dAMP B-Chemical
with O
lower O
efficiency. O
The O
monophosphates B-Chemical
of O
araC B-Chemical
and O
dFdC B-Chemical
were O
shown O
to O
be O
phosphorylated O
with O
similar O

as O
dCMP B-Chemical
and O
CMP. B-Chemical
We O
further O
showed, O
in O
a O
combined O
enzymatic O
assay, O
that O
human B-Species
deoxycytidine B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
and O
UMP-CMP B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
together O
phosphorylated O
araC, B-Chemical
dFdC, B-Chemical
and O
2',3'-dideoxycytidine B-Chemical
to O
their O
diphosphate O
forms. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
showed O
that O
the O
UMP-CMP B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
mRNA O
was O
ubiquitously O
present O
in O
human B-Species
tissues O
as O
a O
3.9-kb O
transcript O
with O
highest O
levels O
in O
pancreas, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
and O

was O
localized O
to O

We O
further O
expressed O
the O
UMP-CMP B-Gene

as O
a O
fusion O

to O
the O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
in O
Chinese B-CellLine
hamster I-CellLine
ovary I-CellLine
cells, O
and O
showed O
that O
the O
fusion O
protein O
was O
located O
in O
the O
cytosol O
