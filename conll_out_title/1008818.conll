# Abstract
Arginase O
was O
purified O
about O
1800-fold O
from O
extracts O
of O
human B-Species
full-term O
placenta; O
the O
enzyme O
appeared O
to O
be O
homogenous O
by O
disc O
electrophoresis O
and O
molecular-sieve O
chromatography. O
The O
mol. O
wt. O
determination O
by O
gel O
filtration O
and O
sodium B-Chemical
dodecyl I-Chemical
sulphate I-Chemical
polyacrylamide-gel O
electrophoresis O
yielded O
a O
value O
of O
70000 O
for O
the O
most O
pure O
and O
the O
partially O
purified O
enzyme. O
The O
human B-Species
placenta O
arginase O
is O
a O
metalloenzyme O
with O
an O
optimum O
pH O
of O
9.1. O
The O
Km O
for O
L-arginine O
is O
27 O
mM. O
L-Ornithine O
and O
L-lysine O
show O
competitive O
inhibition O
with O
Ki O
values O
of O
6.3 O
and O
14 O
mM O
respectively. O
