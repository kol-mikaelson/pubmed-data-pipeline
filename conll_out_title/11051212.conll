# Abstract
Ubiquinone, B-Chemical
known O
as O
coenzyme B-Chemical
Q, I-Chemical
was O
shown O
to O
be O
the O
part O
of O
the O
metabolic O
pathways O
by O
Crane O
et O
al. O
in O
1957. O
Its O
function O
as O
a O
component O
of O
the O
mitochondrial O
respiratory O
chain O
is O
well O
established. O
However, O
ubiquinone B-Chemical
has O
recently O
attracted O
increasing O
attention O
with O
regard O
to O
its O
function, O
in O
the O
reduced O
form, O
as O
an O
antioxidant. O
In O
ubiquinone B-Chemical
synthesis O
the O
para-hydroxybenzoate B-Chemical
ring O
(which O
is O
the O
derivative O
of O
tyrosine B-Chemical
or O
phenylalanine) B-Chemical
is O
condensed O
with O
a O
hydrophobic O
polyisoprenoid B-Chemical
side O
chain, O
whose O
length O
varies O
from O
6 O
to O
10 O
isoprene B-Chemical
units O
depending O
on O
the O
organism. O
para-Hydroxybenzoate B-Chemical
(PHB) O
polyprenyltransferase O
that O
catalyzes O
the O
condensation O
of O
PHB O
with O
polyprenyl B-Chemical
diphosphate I-Chemical
has O
a O
broad O
substrate O
specificity. O
Most O
of O
the O
genes O
encoding O
(all-E)-prenyltransferases O
which O
synthesize O
polyisoprenoid B-Chemical
chains, O
have O
been O
cloned. O
Their O
structure O
is O
either O
homo- O
or O
heterodimeric. O
Genes O
that O
encode O
prenyltransferases O
catalysing O
the O
transfer O
of O
the O
isoprenoid B-Chemical
chain O
to O
para-hydroxybenzoate B-Chemical
were O
also O
cloned O
in O
bacteria O
and O
yeast. B-Species
To O
form O
ubiquinone, B-Chemical
prenylated O
PHB O
undergoes O
several O
modifications O
such O
as O
hydroxylations, O
O-methylations, O
methylations O
and O
decarboxylation. O
In O
eukaryotes O
ubiquinones O
were O
found O
in O
the O
inner O
mitochondrial O
membrane O
and O
in O
other O
membranes O
such O
as O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum, O
Golgi O
vesicles, O
lysosomes O
and O
peroxisomes. O
Still, O
the O
subcellular O
site O
of O
their O
biosynthesis O
remains O
unclear. O
Considering O
the O
diversity O
of O
functions O
of O
ubiquinones, O
and O
their O
multistep O
biosynthesis, O
identification O
of O
factors O
regulating O
their O
cellular O
level O
remains O
an O
elusive O
task. O
