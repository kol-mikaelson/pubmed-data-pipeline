# Abstract
A O
female O
infant O
of O
nonconsanguineous O
Indian O
parents O
presented O
at O
4 O
months O
with O
a O
hypoglycemic B-Disease
convulsion. I-Disease
Further O
episodes O
of O
hypoketotic B-Disease
hypoglycemia I-Disease
were O
associated O
with O
inappropriately O
elevated O
plasma O
insulin B-Gene
concentrations. O
However, O
unlike O
other O
children O
with O
hyperinsulinism, B-Disease
this O
patient B-Species
had O
a O
persistently O
elevated O
blood O
spot O
hydroxybutyrylcarnitine B-Chemical
concentration O
when O
fed, O
as O
well O
as O
when O
fasted. O
Measurement O
of O
the O
activity O
of O
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
in O
cultured O
skin O
fibroblasts O
with O
acetoacetyl-CoA B-Chemical
substrate O
showed O
reduced O
activity. O
In O
fibroblast O
mitochondria, O
the O
activity O
was O
less O
than O
5% O
that O
of O
controls. O
Sequencing O
of O
the O
short-chain B-Gene
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(SCHAD) B-Gene
genomic O
DNA O
from O
the O
fibroblasts O
showed O
a O
homozygous O
mutation O
(C773T) B-DNAMutation
changing O
proline B-ProteinMutation
to I-ProteinMutation
leucine I-ProteinMutation
at I-ProteinMutation
amino I-ProteinMutation
acid I-ProteinMutation
258. I-ProteinMutation
Analysis O
of O
blood O
from O
the O
parents O
showed O
they O
were O
heterozygous O
for O
this O
mutation. O
Western O
blot O
studies O
showed O
undetectable O
levels O
of O
immunoreactive O
SCHAD B-Gene
protein O
in O
the O
child's O
fibroblasts. O
Expression O
studies O
showed O
that O
the O
P258L B-ProteinMutation
enzyme O
had O
no O
catalytic O
activity. O
We O
conclude O
that O
C773T B-DNAMutation
is O
a O
disease-causing O
SCHAD B-Gene
mutation. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
defect O
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation O
that O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
hyperinsulinism B-Disease
and O
raises O
interesting O
questions O
about O
the O
ways O
in O
which O
changes O
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
ketone B-Chemical
body O
metabolism O
modulate O
insulin B-Gene
secretion O
by O
the O
beta O
cell. O
The O
patient's O
hyperinsulinism B-Disease
was O
easily O
controlled O
with O
diazoxide B-Chemical
and O
chlorothiazide. B-Chemical
