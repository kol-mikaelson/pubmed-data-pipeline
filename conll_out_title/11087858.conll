# Abstract
The O

K-dependent O
carboxylase O
modifies O

vitamin O
K-dependent O
proteins O
involved O
in O
hemostasis, O
cell O
growth O

and O
calcium B-Chemical

Using O
a O
novel O
mechanism, O
the O
carboxylase O
transduces O
the O

of O
vitamin B-Chemical

oxygenation O
to O
convert O
glutamate B-Chemical
into O
a O
carbanion O
intermediate, O
which O
subsequently O
attacks O
CO(2), B-Chemical
generating O
the O
gamma-carboxylated O
glutamate B-Chemical
product. O
How O
the O
carboxylase O

this O

is O
poorly O

because O
the O

we O
