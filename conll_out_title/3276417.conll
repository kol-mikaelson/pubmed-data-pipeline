# Abstract
Using O
solid-phase O
extraction O
columns O
and O
"high-performance" O
liquid-chromatographic O
(HPLC) O
analysis, O
we O
could O
determine O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
and O
nine O
of O
its O
metabolites O
in O
blood, O
bile, O
and O
urine. O
To O
facilitate O
calculations O
of O
concentrations O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolites O
from O
the O
chromatograms, O
we O
used O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
D I-Chemical
as O
internal O
standard. O
For O
the O
HPLC O
analysis O
we O
used O
two O
sequential O
250-mm O
analytical O
columns O
filled O
with O
reversed-phase O
octyl O
(C8) O
sorbent, O
eluting O
with O
a O
concave O
gradient O
of O
water, B-Chemical
adjusted O
to O
pH O
3.0 O
with O
phosphoric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
acetonitrile. B-Chemical
Peaks O
were O
detected O
at O
205 O

For O
characterization O
of O
the O
chromatographic O

we O
isolated, O

as O
authentic O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
metabolites. O
Analytical O
recovery O
was O
70-80%. O
The O
inter-assay O
CV O
for O
bile O
was O
7.2%, O
for O
urine O
12.3%. O
The O
method O
was O
used O
for O
routine O
monitoring O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
