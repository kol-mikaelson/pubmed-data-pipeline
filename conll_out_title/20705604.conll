# Abstract
ABCG2 B-Gene
is O
an O
ATP-binding B-Gene
cassette I-Gene
(ABC) B-Gene
transporter O
preferentially O
expressed O
by O
immature O
human B-Species
hematopoietic O
progenitors. O
Due O
to O
its O
role O
in O
drug O
resistance, O
its O
expression O
has O
been O
correlated O
with O
a O
protection O
role O
against O
protoporhyrin O
IX O

accumulation O
in O
stem O
cells O
under O
hypoxic B-Disease
conditions. O
We O
show O
here O
that O
zinc B-Chemical
mesoporphyrin, I-Chemical
a O
validated O
fluorescent O
heme B-Chemical
analog, O
is O
transported O
by O
ABCG2. B-Gene
We O
also O
show O
that O
the O
ABCG2 B-Gene
large O
extracellular O
loop O
ECL3 O
constitutes O
a O
porphyrin-binding O
domain, O
which O
strongly O
interacts O
with O
heme, B-Chemical
hemin, B-Chemical
PPIX, O
ZnPPIX, O
CoPPIX, O
and O
much O
less O
efficiently O

pheophorbide B-Chemical

but O
not O
with O
vitamin B-Chemical

are O
in O
the O
range O
0.5-3.5 O
mum, O
with O
heme B-Chemical
displaying O
the O
highest O
affinity. O
Nonporphyrin O
substrates O
of O
ABCG2, B-Gene
such O
as O
mitoxantrone, B-Chemical
doxo B-Chemical
daunorubicin, B-Chemical
and O
riboflavin, B-Chemical
do O
not O
bind O
to O
ECL3. O
Single-point O
mutations O
H583A B-ProteinMutation
and O
C603A B-DNAMutation
inside O
ECL3 O
prevent O
the O
binding O
of O
hemin B-Chemical
but O
hardly O
affect O
that O
of O
iron-free O
PPIX. O
The O
extracellular O
location O
of O
ECL3 O
downstream O
from O
the O
transport O
sites O
suggests O
that, O
after O
membrane O
translocation, O
hemin B-Chemical
is O
transferred O
to O
ECL3, O
which O
is O
strategically O
positioned O
to O
release O
the O
bound O
porphyrin B-Chemical
to O
extracellular O
partners. O
We O
show O
here O
that O
human B-Species
serum O
albumin B-Gene
could O
be O
one O
of O
these O
possible O
partners O
as O
it O
removes O
hemin B-Chemical
bound O
to O
ECL3 O
and O
interacts O
with O
ABCG2, B-Gene
