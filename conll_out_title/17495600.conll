PURPOSE O
OF O
REVIEW: O
Fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transport O
proteins O
are O
a O
family O
of O
proteins O
involved O
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
and O
activation. O
This O
review O
summarizes O
recent O
progress O
in O
elucidating O
the O
function O
of O
fatty B-Chemical

RECENT O
FINDINGS: O
Recent O
experiments O
clearly O
establish O
FATP1 B-Gene
as O
a O
regulated O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporter O
in O
both O
adipose O

and O
muscle O
with O
important O
roles O
in O
energy O
homeostasis, B-Disease
thermogenesis O
and O
insulin B-Disease
resistance. I-Disease
Knockout O
of O

for O
both O

reconjugation. O
The O
most O
striking O
phenotype O
of O
FATP4 B-Gene
deletion O
is O
a O
defect O
in O
skin O
homeostasis, B-Disease
which O
may O
be O
due O
to O
its O
very O
long O

activity. O
Fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transport O
proteins O
are O
increasingly O
being O
recognized O
as O
multifunctional O
proteins O
that O
can O
mediate O
the O
uptake O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
catalyze O
the O
formation O
of O

using O
long-chain O

SUMMARY: O
Modulation O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transport O
protein O
function O
can O
result O
in O
altered O

Both O
fatty B-Chemical

uptake O
and O
enzymatic O

of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transport O
proteins O
likely O
contribute O
to O
these O

Future O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
better O
understand O
the O
