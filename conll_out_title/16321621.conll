# Abstract
OBJECTIVE: O
Our O
objective O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
interactions O
between O
common O
polymorphisms O
in O
ABCB1, B-Gene
CYP3A4, B-Gene
and O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
genes O
and O
the O
lipid-lowering O
efficacy O
and O
safety O
of O
the O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme B-Gene
A I-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitor O
simvastatin. B-Chemical
METHODS: O
One O
hundred O
sixteen O
hypercholesterolemic B-Disease
patients B-Species
were O
prospectively O
screened O
by O
physical O
examination, O
medical O
history, O
and O
clinical O
laboratory O
evaluation O
and O
were O
included O
in O
this O
study. O
Subjects O
entering O
the O
study O
were O
treated O
with O
20 O
mg O
d O
simvastatin. B-Chemical
Plasma O
lipid B-Chemical
and O
lipoprotein O
levels O
were O
measured O
before O
treatment, O
after O
2 O
months O
of O
treatment, O
and O
after O
6 O
months O
of O
treatment. O
Ninety-nine O
patients B-Species
completed O
the O
6-month O
follow-up O
and O
were O
included O
in O
the O
association O
analysis O
for O
treatment O
efficacy. O
Seventeen O
subjects O
who O
had O
adverse B-Disease
drug I-Disease
reactions I-Disease
(ADRs) B-Disease
to O
simvastatin B-Chemical
(ADR B-Disease
group) O
could O
not O
complete O
the O
6-month O
follow-up O
and O
were O
included O
in O
the O
association O
analyses O
for O
safety. O
Myalgia B-Disease
was O
observed O
in O
15 O
of O
17 O
subjects O
and O
was O
the O
only O
ADR B-Disease
included O
in O
the O
association O
analyses, O
but O
other O
common O
ADRs B-Disease
were O
also O
observed. O
Myalgia B-Disease
was O
defined O
as O
proximal O
or O
diffuse O
muscle B-Disease
pain, B-Disease
tenderness, B-Disease
or O
weakness, B-Disease
or O
both O
pain B-Disease
and O
weakness, B-Disease
with O
normal O
or O
slightly O
increased O
serum O
creatine O

levels. O
ABCB1 B-Gene

CYP3A4 B-Gene
(-392A>G), B-DNAMutation

were O
determined O
by O

RESULTS: O
After O
adjustment O
for O
covariates, O
carriers O
of O
the O
ABCB1 B-Gene
1236T B-DNAMutation

had O
a O

No O
