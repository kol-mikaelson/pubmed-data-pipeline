# Abstract
Very B-Disease
Long-Chain I-Disease
Acyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
(VLCAD) B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
an O
inborn B-Disease
error I-Disease
of O
mitochondrial O
long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical

oxidation O
(FAO) O
most O
often O
occurring O
in O
childhood O
with O
cardiac B-Disease
or I-Disease
liver I-Disease
involvement, I-Disease
but O
rhabdomyolysis B-Disease
attacks O
have O
also O
been O
reported O
in O
adults. O
We O
report O
in O
this O
study O
the O
clinical, O
biochemical O
and O
molecular O
studies O
in O
13 O
adult O
patients B-Species
from O
10 O
different O
families O
with O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
The O
enzyme O
defect O
was O
demonstrated O
in O
cultured O
skin O
fibroblasts O
or O
lymphocytes. O
All O
patients B-Species
exhibited O
exercise O
intolerance O
and O
recurrent O
rhabdomyolysis B-Disease
episodes, O
which O
were O
generally O
triggered O
by O
strenuous O
exercise, O
fasting, O
cold O
or O
fever B-Disease
(mean O
age O
at O
onset: O
10 O
years). O
Inaugural O
life-threatening O
general O
manifestations O
also O
occurred O
before O
the O
age O
of O

years O
in O
four O
patients. B-Species
Increased O
levels O
of O
long-chain B-Chemical
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
with O
tetradecenoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(C14:1) O
as O
the O
most O
prominent O
species O
were O
observed O
in O
all O
patients. B-Species
Muscle O
biopsies O
showed O
a O
mild O
lipidosis B-Disease
in O
four O
patients. B-Species
For O
all O
patients B-Species
but O
two, O
molecular O
analysis O
showed O
homozygous O
(4 O
patients) B-Species
or O
compound O
heterozygous O
genotype O
(7 O
patients). B-Species
For O
the O
two O
remaining O
patients, B-Species
only O
one O
mutation O
in O
a O
heterozygous O
state O
was O
detected. O
This O
study O
confirms O
that O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
although O
being O
less O
frequent O
than O
CPT B-Disease
II I-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
should O
be O
systematically O
considered O
in O
the O
differential O
diagnosis O
of O
exercise-induced O
rhabdomyolysis. B-Disease
Measurement O
of O
fasting O
blood O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
by O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
allows O
accurate O
biochemical O
diagnosis O
and O
should O
therefore O
be O
performed O
in O
all O
patients B-Species
presenting O
with O
unexplained O

or O
rhabdomyolysis. B-Disease
