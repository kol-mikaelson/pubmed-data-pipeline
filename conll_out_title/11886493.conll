# Abstract
5 B-Chemical
alpha-dihydrotestosterone I-Chemical
is O
known O
to O
play O
a O
crucial O
part O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
hair O
growth O
and O
in O
the O
development O
of O
androgenetic B-Disease
alopecia. I-Disease
5 B-Chemical
alpha-dihydrotestosterone I-Chemical
is O
formed O
locally O
within O
the O
hair O
follicle B-Disease
from O
the O
systemic O
precursor O
testosterone B-Chemical
by O
cutaneous O
steroid O
5 O
alpha-reductase. O
Moreover, O
adrenal O
steroids B-Chemical
such O
as O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
are O
converted O
to O
5 B-Chemical
alpha-dihydrotestosterone I-Chemical
by O
isolated O
hair O
follicles, O
which O
may O
provide O
an O
additional O
source O
of O
intrafollicular O
5 B-Chemical
alpha-dihydrotestosterone I-Chemical
levels. O
Elevated O
urinary O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
and O
serum O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
present O
in O
balding O
young O
men. B-Species
These O
reports O
suggest O
that O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
may O
act O
as O
an O
important O
endocrine O
factor O
in O
the O
development O
of O
androgenetic B-Disease
alopecia. I-Disease
Hence O
the O
question O
arises O
whether O
the O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
can O
be O
metabolized O
within O
the O
hair O
follicles O
to O
yield O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
by O
the O
microsomal O
enzyme O
steroid O
sulfatase, O
and O
where O
steroid O
sulfatase O
might O
be O
localized. O
We O
therefore O
performed O
immunostaining O
for O
steroid O
sulfatase O
on O
human B-Species
scalp O
biopsies O
as O
well O
as O
analysis O
of O
steroid O
sulfatase O
enzyme O
activity O
in O
defined O
compartments O
of O
human B-Species
beard O
and O
occipital O
hair O
follicles O
ex O
vivo. O
Using O
both O
methods O
steroid O
sulfatase O
was O
primarily O
detected O
in O
the O
dermal O
papilla. O
Steroid O
sulfatase O
activity O
was O
inhibited O
by O
estrone-3-O-sulfamate, B-Chemical
a O
specific O
inhibitor O
of O
steroid O
sulfatase, O
in O
a O
concentration-dependent O
way. O
Furthermore, O
we O
show O
that O
dermal O
papillae O
are O
able O
to O
utilize O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
to O
produce O
5 B-Chemical
alpha-dihydrotestosterone, I-Chemical
which O
lends O
further O
support O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
contributes O
to O
androgenetic B-Disease
alopecia I-Disease
and O
that O
steroid O
sulfatase O
inhibitors O
could O
be O
novel O
drugs O
to O
treat O
androgen-dependent B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
of I-Disease
the I-Disease
hair O
follicle B-Disease
such O
as O
androgenetic B-Disease
alopecia I-Disease
or O
hirsutism. B-Disease
