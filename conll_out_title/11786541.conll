Prostaglandin B-Chemical

a O

the O

series, O
such O
as O
15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) B-Chemical
(15d-PGJ(2)), B-Chemical
which O
have O
been O
suggested O
to O
exert O
anti-inflammatory O
effects O
in O
vivo. O
Meanwhile, O
the O
mechanism O
of O
these O

is O
not O
well O
understood O
and O
the O
natural O
site O
and O
the O
extent O
of O
its O
production O
in O

remain O
unclear. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
raised O
a O
monoclonal O
antibody O
specific O
to O
15d-PGJ(2) B-Chemical
and O
determined O
its O
production O
in O
inflammation-related O
events. O
The O
monoclonal O
antibody O
(mAb11G2) O
was O
raised O
against O
the O
15d-PGJ(2)-keyhole O
limpet O
hemocyanin O
conjugate O
and O
was O
found O
to O
recognize O
free O
15d-PGJ(2) B-Chemical
specifically. O
The O
presence O
of O
15d-PGJ(2) B-Chemical
in O
vivo O
was O
immunohistochemically O
verified O
in O
the O
cytoplasm O
of O
most O
of O
the O
foamy O
macrophages O
in O
human B-Species
atherosclerotic B-Disease
plaques. I-Disease
In O
addition, O
the O
immunostaining O
of O
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated O
RAW264.7 B-CellLine
macrophages O
with O
mAb11G2 O
demonstrated O
an O
enhanced O
intracellular O
accumulation O
of O
15d-PGJ(2), B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
the O
PGD(2) B-Chemical
metabolic O
pathway, O
generating O
the O
anti-inflammatory O
PGs, B-Chemical
is O
indeed O
utilized O
in O
the O
cells O
during O
inflammation. B-Disease
The O
activation O
of O
macrophages O
also O
resulted O
in O
the O
extracellular O
production O
of O
PGD(2), B-Chemical
which O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
extracellular O
15d-PGJ(2) B-Chemical
levels, O
and O
the O
extracellular O
15d-PGJ(2) B-Chemical
production O
was O
reproduced O
by O
incubating O
PGD(2) B-Chemical
in O
a O
cell-free O
medium O
and O
in O
phosphate-buffered B-Chemical
saline. I-Chemical
Moreover, O
using O
a O
chiral O
high O
performance O
liquid O
chromatography O
method O
for O
separation O
of O
PGD(2) B-Chemical
metabolites, O
we O
established O
a O
novel O
metabolic O
pathway, O
in O
which O
PGD(2) B-Chemical
is O
converted O
to O
15d-PGJ(2) B-Chemical
via O
an O
albumin-independent O
mechanism. O
