# Abstract
Stargardt-like B-Disease
macular I-Disease
dystrophy I-Disease
(STGD3, B-Disease
MIM O
600110) O
and O
autosomal B-Disease
dominant I-Disease
macular I-Disease
dystrophy I-Disease
(adMD) B-Disease
are O
inherited O
forms O
of O
macular O
degeneration O
characterized O
by O
decreased O
visual O
acuity, O
macular B-Disease
atrophy I-Disease
and O
extensive O
fundus O
flecks. O
Genetic O
mapping O
data O
suggest O
that O
mutations O
in O
a O
single O
gene O
may O
be O
responsible O
for O
both O
conditions, O
already O
known O
to O
bear O
clinical O
resemblance. O
Here O
we O
limit O
the O
minimum O
genetic O
region O
for O
STGD3 B-Disease
and O
adMD B-Disease
to O
a O
0.6-cM O

by O
recombination O

mapping O
and O
identify O
a O
single O
5-bp O
deletion O
within O
the O
protein-coding O
region O
of O
a O

gene, O
ELOVL4, O
in O
all O
affected O
members O
of O
STGD3 B-Disease

families. O
Bioinformatic O
analysis O
of O
ELOVL4 O
revealed O
that O
it O
has O

a O

that O
function O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O

Our O
results O
are O
therefore O
the O
first O

the O
