# Abstract
The O
oxidative O
metabolism O
of O
17beta-estradiol B-Chemical
(E2) B-Chemical
and O
estrone B-Chemical
(E1) B-Chemical
to O
catechol B-Chemical
estrogens I-Chemical
(2-OHE2, B-Chemical
4-OHE2, B-Chemical
2-OHE1, B-Chemical
and O
4-OHE1) B-Chemical
and O
estrogen B-Chemical
quinones I-Chemical
has O
been O
postulated O
to O
be O
a O
factor O
in O
mammary B-Disease
carcinogenesis. I-Disease
Catechol-O-methyltransferase B-Gene
(COMT) B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
methylation O
of O
catechol B-Chemical
estrogens I-Chemical
to O
methoxy B-Chemical
estrogens, I-Chemical
which O
simultaneously O
lowers O
the O
potential O
for O
DNA O
damage O
and O
increases O
the O
concentration O
of O
2-methoxyestradiol B-Chemical
(2-MeOE2), B-Chemical
an O
antiproliferative O
metabolite. O
We O
expressed O
two O
recombinant O
forms O
of O
COMT, B-Gene
the O
wild-type O
(108Val) O
and O
a O
common O
variant O
(108Met), O
to O
determine O
whether O
their O
catalytic O
efficiencies O
differ O
with O
respect O
to O
catechol B-Chemical
estrogen I-Chemical
inactivation. O
The O
His-tagged O
proteins O
were O
purified O
by O
nickel-nitrilo-triacetic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
chromatography O
and O
analyzed O
by O
electrophoresis O
and O
Western O
immunoblot. O
COMT B-Gene
activity O
was O
assessed O
by O
determining O
the O
methylation O
of O
2-OHE2, B-Chemical
4-OHE2, B-Chemical
2-OHE1, B-Chemical
and O
4-OHE1, B-Chemical
using O
gas O
chromatography O
mass O

for O
quantitation O
of O
the O
respective O
methoxy O
products. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
2-OHE2 B-Chemical
and O
2-OHE1, B-Chemical
methylation O
occurred O
at O
2-OH O
and O
3-OH O
groups, O
resulting O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
2-MeOE2 B-Chemical
and O
2-OH-3-MeOE2, B-Chemical
and O
2-MeOE1 B-Chemical
and O
2-OH-3-MeOE1, B-Chemical
respectively. O
In O
contrast, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
4-OHE2 B-Chemical
and O
4-OHE1, B-Chemical
methylation O
occurred O
only O
at O
the O
4-OH O
group, O
yielding O
4-MeOE2 B-Chemical
and O
4-MeOE1, B-Chemical
respectively. O
Individual O
and O
competition O
experiments O
revealed O
the O
following O
order O
of O
product O
formation: O
4-MeOE2 B-Chemical
> O
4-MeOE1 B-Chemical
>> O
2-MeOE2 B-Chemical
> O
2-MeOE1 B-Chemical
> O
2-OH-3-MeOE1 B-Chemical
> O
2-OH-3-MeOE2. B-Chemical
The O
variant O
isoform O
differed O
from O
wild-type O
COMT B-Gene
by O
being O
thermolabile, O
leading O
to O
2-3-fold O
lower O
levels O
of O
product O
formation. O
MCF-7 B-CellLine

cancer I-Disease

with O
the O
variant O
COMT B-Gene

Met O
genotype O
also O
displayed O
2-3-fold O
lower O
catalytic O

than O
ZR-75 B-CellLine
breast B-Disease
cancer I-Disease

with O
the O

Thus, O
inherited O
alterations O
in O
COMT B-Gene
catalytic O

are O
associated O
with O
significant O
differences O
in O
catechol B-Chemical
estrogen I-Chemical
and O
methoxy O
estrogen O
levels O
and, O
thereby, O
may O
contribute O
to O
interindividual O
differences O
in O
breast B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
risk O
associated O
with O
estrogen-mediated O
carcinogenicity. O
