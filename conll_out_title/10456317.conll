# Abstract
We O
have O
identified O
the O
fifth O
member O
of O
the O
mammalian O
X,K-ATPase O
beta-subunit O
gene O
family. O
The O
human B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
genes O
are O
largely O
expressed O
in O
skeletal O
muscle O
and O
at O
a O
lower O
level O
in O
heart. O
The O
deduced O
human B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
proteins O
designated O
as O
beta(muscle) B-Gene
(beta(m)) B-Gene
consist O
of O
357 O
and O
356 O
amino O
acid O
residues, O
respectively, O
and O
exhibit O
89% O
identity. O
The O
sequence O
homology O
of O
beta(m) B-Gene
proteins O
with O
known O
Na,K- B-Gene
and I-Gene
H,K-ATPase I-Gene
beta-subunits I-Gene
are O
30.5-39.4%. O
Unlike O
other O
beta-subunits, O
putative O
beta(m) B-Gene
proteins O
have O
large O
N-terminal O
cytoplasmic O
domains O
containing O
long O
Glu-rich O
sequences. O
The O
data O
obtained O
indicate O
the O
existence O
of O
hitherto O
unknown O
X,K-ATPase O
(most O
probably O
Na,K-ATPase) O
isozymes O
in O
muscle O
cells. O
