# Abstract
X-linked B-Disease
dominant I-Disease
Conradi-Hunermann I-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
(CDPX2; B-Gene
MIM B-Disease
302960) I-Disease
is O
one O
of O
a O
group O
of O
disorders O
with O
aberrant B-Disease
punctate I-Disease
calcification I-Disease
in I-Disease
cartilage, I-Disease
or O
chondrodysplasia B-Disease
punctata I-Disease
(CDP). B-Disease
This O
is O
most O
prominent O
around O
the O
vertebral O
column, O
pelvis O
and O
long O
bones O
in O
CPDX2. O
Additionally, O
CDPX2 B-Gene
patients B-Species
may O
have O
asymmetric O
rhizomesomelia, B-Disease
sectorial O
cataracts, B-Disease
patchy O
alopecia, B-Disease
ichthyosis B-Disease
and O
atrophoderma. B-Disease
The O
phenotype O
in O
CDPX2 B-Gene
females O
ranges O
from O
stillborn B-Disease
to O
mildly O
affected O
individuals O
identified O
in O
adulthood. O
CDPX2 B-Gene
is O
presumed O
lethal O
in O
males, O
although O
a O
few O
affected O
males O
have O
been O
reported. O
We O
found O
increased O
8(9)-cholestenol B-Chemical
and O
8-dehydrocholesterol B-Chemical
in O
tissue O
samples O
from O
seven O
female O
probands O
with O
CDPX2 B-Gene
(ref. O
4). O
This O
pattern O
of O
accumulated O
cholesterol B-Chemical
intermediates O
suggested O
a O
deficiency O
of O
3beta-hydroxysteroid-delta8,delta7-isomerase B-Gene
(sterol-delta8-isomerase), O
which O
catalyses O
an O
intermediate O
step O
in O
the O
conversion O
of O
lanosterol B-Chemical
to O
cholesterol. B-Chemical
A O
candidate O
gene O
encoding O
a O
sterol-delta8-isomerase O
(EBP) B-Gene
has O
been O
identified O
and O
mapped O
to O
Xp11.22-p11.23 O
(refs O
5,6). O
Using O
SSCP O
analysis O
and O
sequencing O
of O
genomic O
DNA, O
we O
found O
EBP B-Gene
mutations O
in O
all O
probands. O
We O
confirmed O
the O
functional O
significance O
of O
two O
missense O
alleles O
by O
expressing O
them O
in O
a O
sterol-delta8-isomerase-deficient O
yeast B-Species
strain. O
Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
defects O
in O
sterol-delta8-isomerase O
cause O
CDPX2 B-Gene
and O
suggest O
a O
role O
for O
sterols B-Chemical
in O
bone O
development. O
