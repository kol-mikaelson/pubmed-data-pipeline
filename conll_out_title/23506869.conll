# Abstract
The O
solute O
carrier O
(SLC) O
family O
10 O
(SLC10) O
comprises O
influx O
transporters O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
steroidal B-Chemical
hormones, I-Chemical
various O
drugs, O
and O
several O
other O
substrates. O
Because O
the O
seminal O
transporters O
of O
this O
family, O
namely, O
sodium B-Gene
taurocholate I-Gene
cotransporting I-Gene
polypeptide I-Gene
(NTCP; B-Gene
SLC10A1) B-Gene
and O
the O
apical O
sodium-dependent O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporter O
(ASBT; B-Gene
SLC10A2), B-Gene
were O
primarily O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporters, O
the O
term O
"sodium O
bile O
salt O
cotransporting O
family" O
was O
used O
for O
the O
SLC10 O
family. O
However, O
this O
notion O
became O
obsolete O
with O
the O
finding O
of O
other O
SLC10 O
members O
that O
do O
not O
transport O
bile B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
For O
example, O
the O
sodium-dependent B-Gene
organic I-Gene
anion I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
(SOAT; B-Gene
SLC10A6) B-Gene
transports O
primarily O
sulfated O
steroids. B-Chemical
Moreover, O
NTCP B-Gene
was O
shown O
to O
also O
transport O
steroids B-Chemical
and O
xenobiotics, O
including O
HMG-CoA B-Chemical
inhibitors I-Chemical
(statins). B-Chemical
The O
SLC10 O
family O
contains O
four O
additional O
members, O
namely, O
P3 O
(SLC10A3; B-Gene
SLC10A3), B-Gene
P4 O
(SLC10A4; B-Gene
SLC10A4), B-Gene
P5 O
(SLC10A5; B-Gene
SLC10A5) B-Gene
and O
SLC10A7 B-Gene
(SLC10A7), B-Gene
several O
of O
which O
were O
unknown O
or O
considered O
hypothetical O
until O
approximately O
a O
decade O
ago. O
While O
their O
substrate O
specificity O
remains O
undetermined, O
great O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
towards O
their O
characterization O
in O
recent O
years. O
Explicitly, O
SLC10A4 B-Gene
may O
participate O
in O
vesicular O
storage O
or O
exocytosis O
of O
neurotransmitters O
or O
mastocyte O
mediators, O
whereas O
SLC10A5 B-Gene
and O
SLC10A7 B-Gene
may O
be O
involved O
in O
solute O
transport O
and O
SLC10A3 B-Gene
may O
have O
a O
role O
as O
a O
housekeeping O
protein. O
Finally, O
the O
newly O
found O
role O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
in O
glucose B-Chemical
and O
energy O
homeostasis, O
via O
the O
TGR5 O
receptor, O
sheds O
new O
light O
on O
the O
clinical O
relevance O
of O
ASBT B-Gene
and O
NTCP. B-Gene
The O
present O
mini-review O
provides O
a O
brief O
summary O
of O
recent O
progress O
on O
members O
of O
the O
SLC10 O
family. O
