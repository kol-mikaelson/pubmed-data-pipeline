# Abstract
The O
luminal B-Chemical
pH O
of O
organelles O
along O
the O
secretory O
and O
endocytic O
pathways O
of O
mammalian O
cells O
is O
acidic O
and O
tightly O
regulated, O
with O
the O
[H+] O
varying O
up O
to O
100-fold O
between O
compartments. O
Steady-state O
organellar O
pH O
is O
thought O
to O
reflect O
a O
balance O
between O
the O
rates O
of O
H+ O
pumping O
by O
the O
vacuolar-type O
H+-ATPase O
and O
H+ O
efflux O
through O
ill-defined O
pathways. O
Here, O
we O
describe O
the O
cloning O
of O
a O
novel O
gene O
(NHE7) B-Gene
in O
humans B-Species
that O
is O
homologous O
to O
Na+ O
H+ O
exchangers, O
is O
ubiquitously O
expressed, O
and O
localizes O
predominantly O
to O
the O
trans-Golgi O
network. O
Significantly, O
NHE7 B-Gene
mediates O
the O
influx O
of O
Na+ O
or O
K+ O
in O
exchange O
for O
H+. O
The O
activity O
of O
NHE7 B-Gene
was O
also O
found O
to O
be O
relatively O
insensitive O
to O
inhibition O
by O
amiloride B-Chemical
but O
could O
be O
antagonized O
by O
the O
analogue O
benzamil B-Chemical
and O
the O
unrelated O
compound O
quinine. B-Chemical
Thus, O
NHE7 B-Gene
displays O
unique O
functional O
and O
pharmacological O
properties O
and O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
maintaining O
cation O
homeostasis O
of O
this O
important O
organelle. O
