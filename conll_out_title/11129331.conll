# Abstract
Deficiency B-Disease
of I-Disease
mitochondrial I-Disease
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl I-Disease
CoA I-Disease
lyase I-Disease
(HL, O
EC4.1.3.4.) O
is O
an O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
genetic I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
characterized O
by O
acute O
episodes O
of O
vomiting, B-Disease
hypotonia, B-Disease
and O
lethargy B-Disease
in O
the O
neonatal O
period O
or O
in O
infancy. O
Except O
in O
Saudi O
Arabia, O
where O
HL B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
the O
most O
common O
organic B-Disease
acidemia, I-Disease
the O
disorder O
is O
quite O
rare O
with O
only O
41 O
cases O
being O
reported O
in O
the O
English O
literature, O
and O
only O
five O
known O
cases O
among O
Japanese. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
present O
the O
results O
of O
a O
molecular O
analysis O
of O
all O
five O
Japanese O
patients B-Species
together O
with O
their O
clinical O
phenotypes. O
Five O
different O
mutations O
in O
the O
HL O
gene O
were O
identified: O
one O
large O
deletion, O
one O
nonsense O
mutation, O
one O
missense O
mutation, O
and O
two O
splice O
mutations. O
Except O
for O
G835A B-DNAMutation
(E279K) B-ProteinMutation
with O
its O
relatively O
common O
occurrence O
among O
Japanese, O
these O
mutations O
were O
unique O
to O
each O
family. O
The O
results O
of O
expression O
studies O
with O
mutated O
HL O
cDNAs O
confirmed O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
these O
mutations O
and O
supported O
the O
importance O
of O
previously O
identified O
functional O
domains O
of O
the O
HL O
molecule, O
i.e., O
the O
putative O
catalytic O
site O
or O
dimerization O
site. O
In O
addition, O
we O
identified O
an O
alternative O
splicing O
event O
that O
resulted O
in O
the O
skipping O
of O
exons O
5 O
and O
6. O
This O
alternatively O
spliced O
product O
did O
not O
show O
HL O
activity O
and O
was O
present O
in O
various O
tissues O
of O
normal O
subjects. O
Clinically, O
all O
patients B-Species
presented O
with O
similar O
symptoms, O
except O
that O
the O
timing O
of O
the O
initial O
presentation O
varied O
considerably, O
from O
1 O
day O
to O
1 O
year O
3 O
months. O
In O
general, O
patients B-Species
with O
null-activity O
mutations O
presented O
earlier O
in O
life, O
whereas O
those O
with O
residual O
activities O
presented O
later. O
