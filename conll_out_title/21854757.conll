# Abstract
Transport O
of O
riboflavin B-Chemical
(RF) B-Chemical
across O
both O
the O
brush O
border O
membrane O
(BBM) O
and O
basolateral O
membrane O
(BLM) O
of O
the O
polarized O
enterocyte O
occurs O
via O
specific O
carrier-mediated O
mechanisms. O
Although, O
three O
human B-Species
riboflavin B-Chemical
transporters O
(hRFTs), O
i.e., O
hRFT-1, B-Gene
hRFT-2 B-Gene
and O
hRFT-3 B-Gene
are O
expressed O
in O
the O
intestine, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
cell O
surface O
domain(s) O
at O
which O
these O
specific O
hRFTs O
are O
expressed. O
Here, O
we O
used O
live O
cell O
confocal O
imaging O
of O
intestinal O
epithelial O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
and O
renal O
MDCK O
cells O
to O
show O
that O
the O
hRFT-1 B-Gene
is O
mainly O
expressed O
at O
the O
BLM, O
hRFT-2 B-Gene
is O
exclusively O
expressed O
at O
the O
apical O
membrane, O
while O
hRFT-3 B-Gene
is O
mostly O
localized O
inside O
intracellular O
vesicular O
structures O
(with O
some O
expression O
at O
the O
BLM). O
Further O
the O
level O
of O
hRFT-2 B-Gene
mRNA O
expression O
in O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
and O
in O
native O
human B-Species
intestine O
is O
significantly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
hRFT-1 B-Gene
and I-Gene
-3; I-Gene
hRFT-2 B-Gene
was O
also O
more O
efficient O
in O
transporting O
3H-RF B-Chemical
than O
hRFT-1 B-Gene
and I-Gene
-3. I-Gene
These O
findings O
implied O
an O
important O
role O
for O
hRFT-2 B-Gene
in O
intestinal O
RF B-Chemical
uptake, O
a O
conclusion O
that O
was O
further O
supported O
by O
findings O
of O
hRFT-2 B-Gene
gene-specific O
siRNA O
knockdown O
investigation. O
These O
results O
show O
that O
members O
of O
the O
hRFT O
family O
are O
differentially O
expressed O
in O
polarized O
epithelia, O
and O
that O
the O
apically O
expressed O
hRFT-2 B-Gene
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
intestinal O
RF B-Chemical
accumulation. O
