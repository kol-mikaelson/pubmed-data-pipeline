# Abstract
The O
mechanism O
of O
uptake O
of O
dietary O
niacin B-Chemical
(nicotinic B-Chemical
acid) I-Chemical
by O
intestinal O
epithelial O
cells O
is O
not O
well O
understood, O
and O
nothing O
is O
known O
about O
regulation O
of O
the O
uptake O
process. O
In O
this O
investigation, O
we O
used O
human-derived O
intestinal O
epithelial O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
and O
purified O
intestinal O
brush-border O
membrane O
vesicles O
(BBMVs) O
isolated O
from O
human B-Species
organ O
donors O
to O
assess O
niacin B-Chemical
uptake. O
Our O
findings O
show O
niacin B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O

1) O

and O

2) O

but O

Caco-2 B-CellLine

unlabeled O
niacin B-Chemical

the O

observed. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
the O
involvement O
of O
a O
specialized, O
pH-dependent, O
carrier-mediated O
mechanism O
for O
human B-Species
intestinal O
niacin B-Chemical
uptake. O
This O
suggestion O
was O
confirmed O
in O
studies O
with O
native O
human B-Species
intestinal O
BBMVs. O
We O
also O
examined O
possible O
regulation O
of O
niacin B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
via O
specific O
intracellular O
regulatory O
pathways. O
The O
results O
show O
that O
while O
the O
PKA-, O
PKC-, B-Gene
and O
Ca2+ O
calmodulin-mediated O
regulatory O
pathways O
play O
no O
role O
in O
regulating O
niacin B-Chemical
uptake, O
a O
role O
for O
a O
protein B-Gene
tyrosine I-Gene
kinase I-Gene
(PTK)-mediated O
pathway O
is O
apparent. O
The O
results O
of O
these O
studies O
show O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
specialized, O
acidic O
pH-dependent, O
carrier-mediated O
system O
of O
niacin B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
human B-Species
intestinal O
epithelial O
cells O
that O
operates O
at O
the O
micromolar O
(physiological) O
range O
of O
niacin. B-Chemical
The O
results O
also O
suggest O
the O
possible O
involvement O
of O
a O
PTK-mediated O
pathway O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
niacin B-Chemical
uptake. O
