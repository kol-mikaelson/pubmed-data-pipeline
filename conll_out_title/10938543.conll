# Abstract
Metal B-Chemical
complexes O
of O
a O
sulfonamide B-Chemical
possessing O
strong O
carbonic O
anhydrase O
(CA) O
inhibitory O
properties, O
5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide B-Chemical
(chlorazolamide) B-Chemical
have O
been O
obtained O
from O
the O
sodium B-Chemical
salt I-Chemical
of O
the O
sulfonamide B-Chemical
and O
the O

Mg(II), B-Chemical
Zn(II), B-Chemical
Mn(II), B-Chemical
Cu(II), B-Chemical

The O
original O
sulfonamide B-Chemical

its O

were O
assayed O
for O
the O
in O

inhibition O
of O
three O
CA O

and I-Gene
IV, I-Gene
some O
of O
which O
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
ocular O
fluid O
secretion. O
All O
these O
compounds O
(the O
sulfonamide B-Chemical
and O
its O
metal B-Chemical
complexes) O
behaved O
as O
powerful O
inhibitors O
against O
the O
three O
investigated O
isozymes. O
The O
parent O
sulfonamide B-Chemical
possessed O
an O
extremely O
weak O
topical O
pressure O
lowering O
effect O
when O
administered O
as O
a O
1-2% O
suspension O
into O
the O
rabbit B-Species
eye, O
but O
some O
of O
its O
metal B-Chemical
complexes, O
such O
as O
the O
Mg(II), B-Chemical
Zn(II), B-Chemical
Mn(II) B-Chemical
and O
Cu(II) B-Chemical
derivatives, O
lower O
intraocular O

in O
ocular O

tissues O
of O
rabbits B-Species
treated O
with O
these O
agents, O
proving O
that O
the O
observed O
IOP O

is O
due O
to O
CA O
inhibition. O
The O

the O
efficiency O
of O
the O
obtained O

are O
discussed, O
leading O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O
designing O
more O
selective O

pharmacological O
agents O
from O
this O
class. O
