# Abstract
Acid O
phosphatase O
(ACP) O
is O
a O
hydrolytic O
lysosomal O
enzyme O
secreted O
by O
a O
number O
of O
cells O
including O
blood O
cells O
as O
well O
as O
by O
the O
prostate, O
bones, O
liver O
and O
other O
tissues. O
Several O
isozymes O
of O
ACP O
have O
tissue O
specificity. O
The O
isozymes O
can O
be O
fractionated O
by O
electrophoresis O
into O
six O
bands. O
Prostatic O
ACP O
(bands O
2-4) O
is O
frequently O
measured O
for O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
prostatic B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
Band O
5, O
tartrate O
resistant O
ACP O
(TRACP) O
consists O
of O
two O
isoforms, O
bands O
5a O
and O
5b. O
TRACP B-Gene
5b I-Gene
is O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
marker O
of O
the O
osteoclasts O
and O
5a O
is O
found O
in O
Gaucher's O
cells, O
or O
in O
the O
leukocytes O
of O
patients O
with O
hairy O
cell O
leukemia. O
