# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Rosuvastatin B-Chemical
is O
a O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl B-Gene
coenzyme I-Gene
A-reductase I-Gene
inhibitor, O
or O
statin, O
that O
has O
been O
developed O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
dyslipidemia. B-Disease
OBJECTIVE: O
This O
study O
assessed O
the O
metabolism, O
excretion, O
and O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
a O
single O
oral O
dose O
of O
radiolabeled O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
([14C]-rosuvastatin) B-Chemical
in O
healthy O
volunteers. O
METHODS: O
This O
was O
a O
nonrandomized, O
open-label, O
single-day O
trial. O
Healthy O
adult O
male O
volunteers O
were O
given O
a O
single O
oral O
dose O
of O
[14C]-rosuvastatin B-Chemical
20 O
mg O
(20 O
mL O
[14C]-rosuvastatin B-Chemical
solution, O
nominally O
containing O
50 O
microCi O
radioactivity). O
Blood, O
urine, O
and O
fecal O
samples O
were O
collected O
up O
to O
10 O
days O
after O
dosing. O
Tolerability O
assessments O
were O
made O
up O
to O
10 O
days O
after O
dosing O
(trial O
completion) O
and O
at O
a O
follow-up O
visit O
within O
14 O
days O
of O
trial O
completion. O
RESULTS: O
Six O
white O
male O
volunteers O
aged O
36 O
to O
52 O
years O
(mean, O
43.7 O
years) O
participated O
in O
the O
trial. O
The O
geometric O
mean O
peak O
plasma O
concentration O
(C(max)) O
of O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
was O
6.06 O
ng O
mL O
and O
was O
reached O
at O
a O
median O
of O
5 O
hours O
after O
dosing. O
At O
C(max), O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
accounted O
for O
approximately O
50% O
of O
the O
circulating O
radioactive O
material. O
Approximately O
90% O
of O
the O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
dose O
was O
recovered O
in O
feces, O
with O
the O
remainder O
recovered O
in O
urine. O
The O
majority O
of O
the O
dose O
(approximately O
70%) O
was O
recovered O
within O
72 O
hours O
after O
dosing; O
excretion O
was O
complete O
by O
10 O
days O
after O
dosing. O
Metabolite O
profiles O
in O
feces O
indicated O
that O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
was O
excreted O
largely O
unchanged O
(76.8% O
of O
the O
dose). O
Two O
metabolites-rosuvastatin-5S-lactone O
and O
N-desmethyl O
rosuvastatin-were O
present O
in O
excreta. O
[14C]-rosuvastatin B-Chemical
was O
well O
tolerated; O
2 O
volunteers O
reported O
4 O
mild O
adverse O
events O
that O
resolved O
without O
treatment. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
majority O
of O
the O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
dose O
was O
excreted O
unchanged. O
Given O
the O
absolute O
bioavailability O
(20%) O
and O
estimated O
absorption O
(approximately O
50%) O
of O
rosuvastatin, B-Chemical
this O
finding O
suggests O
that O
metabolism O
is O
a O
minor O
route O
of O
clearance O
for O
this O
agent. O
