# Abstract
Fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
synthesized O
de O
novo O
from O
acetyl-CoA B-Chemical
and O
malonyl-CoA B-Chemical
through O
a O
series O
of O
reactions O
mediated O
by O
acetyl-CoA B-Chemical
carboxylase O
(ACC) O
and O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthase I-Gene
(FAS). B-Gene
In O
rodents, O
the O
principal O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
produced O
by O
FAS B-Gene
is O
palmitic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(16:0). O
Sterol O
regulatory O
element-binding O
proteins O
(SREBPs) O
enhance O
the O
transcription O
of O
many O
genes O
responsible O
for O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthesis. O
In O
transgenic O
mice B-Species
that O
overexpress O
SREBPs O
in O
liver, O
the O
rate O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthesis O
is O
markedly O
increased, O
owing O
to O
the O
activation O
of O
these O
biosynthetic O
genes, O
which O
include O
ATP B-Gene
citrate I-Gene
lyase, I-Gene
ACC, O
FAS, B-Gene
and O
stearoyl-CoA B-Gene
desaturase. I-Gene
The O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
that O
accumulate O
in O
livers O
of O
SREBP O
transgenic O
mice B-Species
are O
18 O
carbons O
rather O
than O
16 O
carbons O
in O
length, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
enzymes O
required O
for O
the O
elongation O
of O
palmitic B-Chemical
to I-Chemical
stearic I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
may O
be O
induced. O
Here, O
we O
report O
the O
cDNA O
cloning O
of O
a O
murine B-Species
long B-Gene
chain I-Gene
fatty I-Gene
acyl I-Gene
elongase I-Gene
(LCE) B-Gene
that O
was O
identified O
initially O
by O
oligonucleotide O
array O
analysis O
of O
mRNA O
from O
SREBP O
transgenic O
mouse B-Species
livers. O
LCE B-Gene
mRNA O
is O
highly O
expressed O
in O
liver O
and O
adipose O
tissue. O
The O
cDNA O
encodes O
a O
protein O
of O
267 O
amino O
acids O
that O
shares O
sequence O
identity O
with O
previously O
identified O
very O
long O
chain O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
elongases. O
Cells O
that O
overexpress O
LCE B-Gene
show O
enhanced O
addition O
of O
2-carbon O
units O
to O
C12-C16 B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
We O
provide O
evidence O
that O
LCE B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
rate-limiting O
condensing O
step O
in O
this O
reaction. O
The O
current O
studies O
suggest O
that O
mouse B-Species
LCE B-Gene
expression O
is O
increased O
by O
SREBPs O
and O
that O
the O
enzyme O
is O
a O
component O
of O
the O
elusive O
mammalian O
elongation O
system O
that O
converts O
palmitic B-Chemical
to I-Chemical
stearic I-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
