# Abstract
Cell O
culture O
is O
an O
important O
tool O
for O
studying O
injury O
to O
cells O
exposed O
to O
oxidative O
stress. O
The O
human B-Species
hepatoblastoma B-Disease
derived O
Hep B-CellLine
G2 I-CellLine
cells O
retain O
their O
morphology O
and O
most O
of O
their O
function O
in O
culture O
and O
are O
therefore O
widely O
used O
as O
an O
in O
vitro O
model O
of O
human B-Species
hepatocytes. O
Conventional O
cell O
culture O
media O
are O
deficient O
in O
selenium, B-Chemical
which O
is O
essential O
for O
activation O
of O
glutathione B-Chemical
peroxidase O
(GPx), O
a O
key O
enzyme O
in O
the O
defense O
against O
oxidative O
stress. O
Supplementation O
of O
the O
culture O
media O
with O
1 O
microM O
sodium B-Chemical
selenite I-Chemical
increased O
the O
activities O
of O
total O
GPx O
by O
threefold O
and O
the O
selenium-dependent O
GPx O
by O
fourfold O
as O
compared O
to O
cells O
cultured O
in O
control O
media. O
The O
non-selenium-dependent O
GPx O
activity O
was O
unchanged. O
The O
activities O
of O
the O
other O
glutathione B-Chemical
(GSH)-related O
enzymes O
were O
practically O
unchanged O
despite O
a O
tendency O
toward O
elevation. O
The O
activities O
of O
oxidized O
glutathione B-Chemical
(GSSG) O
reductase O
and O
catalase O
increased O
by O
22.4 O
and O
27.4%, O
respectively. O
These O
relatively O
small O
increases O
did O
not O
carry O
statistical O
significance. O
Supplementation O
of O
tissue O
culture O
media O
with O
selenium B-Chemical
may O
prove O
important, O
particularly O
for O
cell O
protection O
against O
oxidative O
stress. O
