# Abstract
Despite O
early O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment, O
35% O
of O
the O
patients B-Species
with O
glutaric B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
type I-Disease
I I-Disease
(GA B-Disease
I) I-Disease
develop O
severe O
neurologic B-Disease
damage. I-Disease
Glutaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
3-hydroxyglutaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
have O
been O
suspected O
to O
cause O
neurodegeneration. B-Disease
Lately, O
this O
has O
been O
questioned, O
however. O
We O
postulate O
that O
glutaconyl O
Coenzyme O
A O
(glutaconyl-CoA) B-Chemical
is O
responsible O
for O
brain B-Disease
damage. I-Disease
Chemically, O
glutaconyl-CoA B-Chemical
is O
an O
analogue O
of O
acrylyl-CoA, B-Chemical
the O
parent O
substance O
of O
the O
extremely O
reactive O
class O
of O
acrylates. B-Chemical
It O
is O
expected O
to O
react O
spontaneously O
with O
sulfhydryl B-Chemical
groups, O
thus O
modifying O
membranes, O
disturbing O
enzyme O
functions O
and O
trapping O
glutathione. B-Chemical
Enhanced O
production O
of O
glutaconyl-CoA B-Chemical
together O
with O
lack O
of O
glutathione B-Chemical
precipitates O
brain B-Disease
damage. I-Disease
Such O
a O
mechanism O
is O
supported O
by O
three O
findings. O
(1) O
The O
addition O
product O
of O
glutaconyl-CoA B-Chemical
to O
cysteine B-Chemical
is O
present O
in O
small O
amounts O
in O
normal O
human B-Species
urine. O
(2) O
Reaction O
of O
methacrylyl-CoA B-Chemical
with O
free O
sulfhydryl B-Chemical
groups O
has O
been O
reported O
previously O
in O
a O
patient B-Species
with O
3-hydroxyisobutyryl B-Disease
CoA I-Disease
deacylase I-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
(3) O
Glutathione B-Chemical
has O
been O
found O

mice. B-Species
