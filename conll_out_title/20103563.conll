This O
review O

provides O
a O
comprehensive O
overview O
of O
these O
transporters O
(both O
rodent O

with O
regard O

tissue O
distribution, O

localization, O
and O

preferences. O
Because O
uptake O
and O
efflux O
transporters O
are O
expressed O
in O
multiple O
cell O
types, O
the O
roles O
of O
transporters O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
tissues, O
including O
the O
liver, O
kidneys, O
intestine, O
brain, O
heart, O
placenta, O
mammary O
glands, O
immune O
cells, O
and O
testes O
are O
discussed. O
Attention O
is O
also O
placed O
upon O
a O
variety O
of O
regulatory O
factors O
that O
influence O
transporter O
expression O
and O
function, O
including O
transcriptional O
activation O
and O
post-translational O
modifications O
as O
well O
as O
subcellular O
trafficking. O
Sex O
differences, O
ontogeny, O
and O
pharmacological O
and O
toxicological O
regulation O
of O
transporters O
are O
also O
addressed. O
Transporters O
are O
important O
transmembrane O
proteins O
that O
mediate O
the O
cellular O
entry O
and O
exit O
of O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
substrates O
throughout O
the O
body O
and O
thereby O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
human B-Species
physiology, O
pharmacology, O
pathology, O
and O
toxicology. O
