# Abstract
Genome-wide O
association O
scans O
with O
high-throughput O
metabolic O
profiling O
provide O
unprecedented O
insights O
into O
how O
genetic O
variation O
influences O
metabolism O
and O
complex O
disease. O
Here O
we O
report O
the O
most O
comprehensive O
exploration O
of O
genetic O
loci O
influencing O
human B-Species
metabolism O
thus O
far, O
comprising O
7,824 O
adult O
individuals O
from O
2 O
European O
population O
studies. O
We O
report O
genome-wide O
significant O
associations O
at O
145 O
metabolic O
loci O
and O
their O
biochemical O
connectivity O
with O
more O
than O
400 O
metabolites O
in O
human B-Species
blood. O
We O
extensively O
characterize O
the O
resulting O
in O
vivo O
blueprint O
of O
metabolism O
in O
human B-Species
blood O
by O
integrating O
it O
with O
information O
on O
gene O
expression, O
heritability O
and O
overlap O
with O
known O
loci O
for O
complex O
disorders, O
inborn O
errors O
of O
metabolism O
and O
pharmacological O
targets. O
We O
further O
developed O
a O
database O
and O
web-based O
resources O
for O
data O
mining O
and O
results O
visualization. O
Our O
findings O
provide O
new O
insights O
into O
the O
role O
of O
inherited O
variation O
in O
blood O
metabolic O
diversity O
and O
identify O
potential O
new O
opportunities O
for O
drug O
development O
and O
for O
understanding O
disease. O
