# Abstract
Using O
the O
published O
protein O
sequence O
from O
a O
rabbit B-Species
microsomal O
glucose-6-phosphate O
dehydrogenase O
G6PD B-Gene
we O
have O
isolated O
and O
sequenced O
a O
cDNA O
clone O
coding O
for O
its O
human B-Species
equivalent, O
which O
is O
also O
known O
as O
hexose-6-phosphate B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(H6PD) B-Gene
and O
glucose B-Gene
dehydrogenase. I-Gene
The O
corresponding O
genomic O
sequence O
is O
in O
the O
databases O
enabling O
its O
localization O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
1p36. I-Chromosome
The O
gene O
spans O
37 O
kb O
and O
consists O
of O
5 O
exons, O
the O
fifth O
of O
which O
codes O
for O
more O
than O
half O
of O
the O
89 O
kDa O
protein. O
The O
first O
intron O
is O
a O
10 O
kb O
insertion O
in O
the O
5' O
untranslated O
sequence. O
The O
predicted O
mRNA O
has O
an O
exceptionally O
long O
(6.5 O
kb) O
3' O
untranslated O
sequence. O
The O
predicted O
protein O
shows O
extensive O
homology O
with O
X-linked O
G6PD, B-Gene
suggesting O
the O
two O
genes O
share O
a O
common O
ancestor O
but O
no O
intron O
positions O
are O
conserved O
between O
the O
two O
genes O
suggesting O
the O
gene O
duplication O
was O
an O
ancient O
event. O
The O
C-terminal O
portion O
of O
the O
protein O
is O
not O
homologous O
with O
G6PD B-Gene
but O
shows O
limited O
homology O
with O
proteins O
of O
unknown O
function O
found O
throughout O
evolution O
and O
encoded O
next O
to O
G6PD B-Gene
in O
various O
micro-organisms. O
Intriguingly O
this O
C-terminal O
portion O
has O
some O
homology O
with O
the O
N-terminal O
sequence O
of O
Plasmodium O
falciparum O
G6PD. B-Gene
