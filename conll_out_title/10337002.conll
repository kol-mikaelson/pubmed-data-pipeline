# Abstract
The O
endogenous O
metabolism O
of O
estrogens O
is O
primarily O
oxidative O
and O
involves O
hydroxylation O
of O
the O
steroid B-Chemical
at O
either O
C2 O
(2-OHE1) B-Chemical
or O
C16 O
(16-OHE1). B-Chemical
While O
the O
2-OHE1 B-Chemical
metabolites O
are O
essentially O
devoid O
of O
peripheral O
biological O
activity, O
16-OHE1 B-Chemical
is O
an O
estrogen O
agonist. O
There O
is O
evidence O
of O
an O
association O
between O
the O
2-OHE1 B-Chemical
16-OHE1 B-Chemical
metabolites O
ratio O
and O
breast B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
risk. O
The O
CYP1A1 B-Gene
gene O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
2-hydroxylation O
(2-OH) B-Chemical
of O
estradiol. B-Chemical
African-American O

wild-type O
CYP1A1 B-Gene

showed O
a O

In O
a O

the O

The O

The O
CYP1A1 B-Gene
