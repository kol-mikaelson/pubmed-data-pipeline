# Abstract
Two O
experiments O
were O
performed O
to O
compare O
the O
effect O
of O
pectin B-Chemical
and O
its O
hydrophobic O
derivatives O
on O
homeostasis O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
cecal O
metabolism O
in O
male O
young O
rats. B-Species
Control O
rats B-Species
were O
fed O
a O
diet O
supplemented O
with O
palm B-Chemical
fat I-Chemical
and O
cholesterol B-Chemical
(50 O
and O
10 O
g O
kg, O
respectively). O
Rats B-Species
of O
other O
groups O
were O
fed O
the O
same O
diet O
containing O
citrus B-Chemical
pectin B-Chemical
or O
octadecylpectinamide B-Chemical
(60 O
g O
kg). O
Diets O
were O
fed O
for O
4 O
weeks. O
In O
experiment O
I, O
pectinamide B-Chemical
of O
lower O
degree O
of O

increased O
serum O

to O

(p>0.05) O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
other O

fractions. O
In O
experiment O
II, O
pectinamide B-Chemical
of O
a O
higher O
degree O
of O
amidation O
(53 O
%) O
significantly O
decreased O
total O

2.08 O
to O
1.67 O
micromol O
ml. O
Amidated B-Chemical
pectins I-Chemical
at O
both O
levels O
of O
substitution O
significantly O
decreased O
hepatic O
concentrations O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
fat. O
In O
both O
experiments O
the O
relative O
weight O
of O
cecum O
in O
the O
pectinamide B-Chemical
group O
was O
significantly O
lower O
than O
in O
pectin B-Chemical
group. O
The O
highest O
cecal O
concentrations O
of O
short-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(SCFA) B-Chemical
were O
found O
in O
rats B-Species
fed O
a O
diet O
with O
pectin B-Chemical
(133.2 O
and O
129.3 O
micromol O
g O
in O
experiment O
I O
and O
II, O
respectively). O
In O
other O
groups, O
cecal O
SCFA B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
(pectinamide B-Chemical
groups) O
or O
non-significantly O
(controls) O
lower. O
In O
wet O
feces, O
SCFA B-Chemical
concentrations O
were O
higher O
and O
butyrate B-Chemical
molar O
proportions O
lower O
than O
in O
corresponding O
cecal O
contents. O
Pectinamide B-Chemical
of O
a O
lower O
or O
higher O
degree O
of O
substitution O
significantly O
increased O
fecal O
content O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
from O
18.5 O
and O
17.3 O
micromol O
g O
in O
controls O
to O
31.8 O
and O
28.0 O
micromol O
g, O
respectively. O
Corresponding O
concentrations O
of O
coprostanol B-Chemical
were O
decreased. O
Effects O
of O
pectin B-Chemical
on O
cholesterol B-Chemical
homeostasis O
were O
absent O
or O
marginal. O
Histological O
examination O
revealed O
that O
hepatic O
tissue O
of O
control O
and O
pectin-fed O
rats B-Species
was O
infiltrated O
with O
lipids. B-Chemical
The O
Sudan O
black-positive O
material O
was O
absent O
in O
the O
liver O
of O
rats B-Species
fed O
pectinamides. B-Chemical
No O
pathological O
changes O
of O
liver O
tissue O
were O
apparent. O
In O
summary, O
hydrophobic O
amidated B-Chemical
pectins I-Chemical
significantly O
altered O
cholesterol B-Chemical
homeostasis O
in O
rats B-Species
and O
might O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
clinically O
effective O
hypocholesterolemic O
agent. O
Low O
cecal O
SCFA B-Chemical
concentrations O
in O
rats B-Species
fed O
pectinamides B-Chemical
suggest O
that O
amidation O
of O
pectin B-Chemical
had O
decreased O
its O
fermentability. O
