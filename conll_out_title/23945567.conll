# Abstract
Cyclooxygenases O
(COX) O
metabolize O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(AA) O
to O
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(HETE), B-Chemical
which O
can O
then O
be O
oxidized O
by O
dehydrogenases, O
such O
as O
15-hydroxyprostaglandin B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(15-PGDH), B-Gene
to O
oxo-eicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(ETE). B-Chemical
We O
have O
previously O
established O
that O
11-oxo-eicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(oxo-ETE) B-Chemical
and O
15-oxo-ETE B-Chemical
are O

Conversely, O

The O
