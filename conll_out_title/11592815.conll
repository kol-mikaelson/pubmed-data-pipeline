# Abstract
We O
have O
carried O
out O
a O
detailed O
sequence O
and O
functional O
analysis O
of O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
facilitative O
glucose B-Chemical
transporter, O
designated O
GLUT10, B-Gene
located O
in O
the O
Type O
2 O
diabetes-linked O
region O
of O
human B-Species
chromosome O
20q12-13.1. O
The O
GLUT10 B-Gene
gene O
is O
located O
between O
D20S888 O
and O
D20S891 O
and O
is O
encoded O
by O
5 O
exons O
spanning O
26.8 O
kb O
of O
genomic O
DNA. O
The O
human B-Species
GLUT10 B-Gene
cDNA O
encodes O
a O
541 O
amino O
acid O
protein O
that O
shares O
between O
31 O
and O
35% O
amino O

with O
human B-Species
GLUT1-8. B-Gene
The O
predicted O
amino O

sequence O
of O
GLUT10 B-Gene
is O
nearly O
identical O
in O
length O
to O
the O
recently O
described O
GLUT9 B-Gene
homologue, O
but O
is O
longer O
than O
other O
known O
members O
of O
the O
GLUT O
family. O
In O
addition, O
we O
have O
cloned O
the O
mouse B-Species
cDNA O
homolog O
of O
GLUT10 B-Gene
that O
encodes O
a O
537 O
amino O
acid O
protein O
that O
shares O
77.3% O
identity O
with O
human B-Species
GLUT10. B-Gene
The O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
probably O
has O
12 O
predicted O
transmembrane O
domains O
and O
shares O
characteristics O
of O
other O
mammalian O
glucose B-Chemical
transporters. O
Human B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
GLUT10 B-Gene
retain O
several O

characteristic O
of O
mammalian O
glucose B-Chemical

to O
trytophan B-Chemical
residues O
previously O
implicated O
in O
GLUT1 B-Gene
cytochalasin B-Chemical
B I-Chemical

and O
hexose B-Chemical
transport. O
Neither O
human B-Species
nor O
mouse B-Species
GLUT10 B-Gene
retains O
the O
full O

but O
instead O
is O
replaced O
with O
P186AG[T,A]. O
A O
