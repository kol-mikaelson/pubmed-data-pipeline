# Abstract
We O
have O
identified O
a O
human B-Species
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase O
from O
the O
HUGE O
(human B-Species
unidentified O
gene-encoded O
large O
proteins) O
protein O
data O
base O
by O
screening O
with O
two O
keywords: O
"one O
transmembrane O
domain" O
and O
"galactosyltransferase O
family." O
The O
identified O
protein O
consists O
of O
802 O
amino O
acids O
with O
a O
type O
II O
transmembrane O
protein O
topology. O
The O
protein O
showed O
weak O
homology O
to O
the O
beta1,3-galactosyltransferase O
family O
on O
the O
amino-terminal O
side O
and O
to O
the O
beta1,4-galactosyltransferase O
family O
on O
the O
carboxyl-terminal O
side. O
The O
expression O
of O
a O
soluble O
recombinant O
form O
of O
the O
protein O
in O
COS-1 B-CellLine
cells O
produced O
an O
active O
enzyme, O
which O
transferred O
not O
only O
the O
glucuronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(GlcUA) B-Chemical
from O
UDP-[(14)C]GlcUA B-Chemical
but O
also O
N-acetylgalactosamine B-Chemical
(GalNAc) B-Chemical
from O
UDP-[(3)H]GalNAc B-Chemical
to O
the O
polymer O
chondroitin. B-Chemical
Identification O
of O
the O
reaction O
products O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
enzyme O
was O
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase, O
with O
both O
beta1,3-GlcUA O
transferase O
and O
beta1,4-GalNAc O
transferase O
activities. O
The O
coding O
region O
of O
the O
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase O
was O
divided O
into O
three O
discrete O
exons O
and O
localized O
to O
chromosome O
15. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
the O
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase O
gene O
exhibited O
ubiquitous O
but O
markedly O
differential O
expression O
in O
the O
human B-Species
tissues O
examined. O
Thus, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
analogous O
to O
human B-Species
heparan O
sulfate O
polymerases, O
the O
single O
polypeptide O
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase O
possesses O
two O
glycosyltransferase O
activities O
required O
for O
chain O
polymerization. O
