# Abstract
In O
human, B-Species
vitamin B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
(l-ascorbic B-Chemical
acid) I-Chemical
is O
an O
essential O
micronutrient O
required O
for O
an O
array O
of O
biological O
functions O
including O
enzymatic O
reactions O
and O
antioxidation. O
We O
describe O
here O
the O
molecular O
cloning O
of O
a O
novel O

encoding O
a O

SVCT1. B-Gene
SVCT1 B-Gene

In O
addition, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O

provides O
the O
