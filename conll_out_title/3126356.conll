# Abstract
In O
addition O
to O
the O
previously O
reported O
abnormalities, O
urine O
extracts O
from O
three O
cases O
of O
succinic B-Chemical
semialdehyde I-Chemical
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
have O
shown O
consistently O
increased O
amounts O
of O
2,4-dihydroxybutyric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
its O
lactone, B-Chemical
and O
3-hydroxypropionic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
metabolites O
related O
to O
the O
alpha-oxidation O
of O
4-hydroxybutyric B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Threo- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
erythro-4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
have O
also O
been O
identified O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
probably O
arise O
from O
the O
reaction O
of O
succinic B-Chemical
semialdehyde I-Chemical
with O
an O
intermediate O
in O
the O
pyruvate O
dehydrogenase O
pathway. O
Adipic O
acid O
excretion O
is O
also O
consistently O
raised, O
suggesting O
secondary O
interference O
with O
mitochondrial O
beta-oxidation. O
The O
presence O
of O
these O
metabolites O
could O
be O
a O
source O
of O
diagnostic O
confusion. O
