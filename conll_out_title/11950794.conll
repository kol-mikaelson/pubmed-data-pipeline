# Abstract
Limonene, B-Chemical
a O
monocyclic O
monoterpene, B-Chemical
is O
present O
in O
orange O

and O
other O
plants O
and O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
chemopreventive O
activities. O
(+)- O
and O
(-)-Limonene B-Chemical
enantiomers O
were O
incubated O
with O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
and O
the O
oxidative O

thus O
formed O
were O
analyzed O
using O
gas O

Two O
kinds O
of O
metabolites, O
(+)- O
and O
(-)-trans-carveol B-Chemical
(a O

and O
(+)- O
and B-Chemical
(-)-perillyl B-Chemical
alcohol I-Chemical
(a O
product O
by O
7-hydroxylation), O
were O
identified, O
and O
the O
latter O
metabolites O
were O
found O

be O
formed O
more O

Interestingly, O
human B-Species
CYP2B6 B-Gene
did O
not O

limonene B-Chemical
oxidations, O
whereas O
rat B-Species
CYP2B1 B-Gene
had O
high O
activities O
in O

limonene B-Chemical
oxidations. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
both O
(+)- O
and O
(-)-limonene B-Chemical
enantiomers O
are O
oxidized O
at O
6- O
and O
7-positions O
by O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
and O
CYP2C19 B-Gene
in O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes. O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
may O
be O
more O
important O
than O
CYP2C19 B-Gene
in O
catalyzing O
limonene B-Chemical
oxidations O
in O
human B-Species

microsomes, O
since O
levels O
of O
the O
former O

are O
more O
abundant O
than O
