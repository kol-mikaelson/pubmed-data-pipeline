The O

The O

Urea B-Chemical

The O

the O

(hGAT1) O
cotransporters O
expressed O
in O
oocytes O
demonstrated O
similar O
urea B-Chemical

properties. O
These O
observations O
suggest O
that O
cotransporters O
behave O
as O
urea B-Chemical
channels O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
substrates. O
Furthermore, O
under O
substrate-transporting O
conditions, O
the O
same O
cotransporters O
serve O
as O
urea B-Chemical
cotransporters. O
This O
could O
account O
for O
urea B-Chemical

in O
cells O
that O

not O
to O
have O
urea B-Chemical

or O
channels. O
