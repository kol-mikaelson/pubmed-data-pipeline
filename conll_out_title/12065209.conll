# Abstract
This O
paper O
contains O
a O
review O
of O
the O
history, O
natural O
occurrence, O
human B-Species
consumption, O
metabolism, O
manufacture, O
and O
the O
results O
of O
eight O
standardized O
animal O
safety O
studies O
using O
trehalose. B-Chemical
Trehalose B-Chemical
(alpha,alpha-trehalose) B-Chemical
is O
a O
naturally O
occurring O
sugar B-Chemical
containing O
two O
D-glucose B-Chemical
units O
in O
an O
alpha,alpha-1,1 O
linkage. O
Trehalose B-Chemical
functions O
in O
many O
organisms O
as O
an O
energy O
source O
or O
a O
protectant O
against O
the O
effects O
of O
freezing O
or O
dehydration. B-Disease
It O
also O
possesses O
physical O
and O
or O
chemical O
properties O
that O
are O
different O
than O
other O
sugars, B-Chemical
which O
may O
make O
trehalose B-Chemical
an O
attractive O
ingredient O
in O
food, O
health O
and O
beauty O
and O
pharmaceutical O
products. O
Data O
are O
presented O
supporting O
safe O
human B-Species
consumption O
of O
trehalose B-Chemical
in O
doses O
up O
to O
50 O
g, O
and O
the O
physiologic O
ability O
of O
humans B-Species
to O
digest O
it. O
No O
consistent O
treatment-related, O
dose-dependent O
adverse O
effects O
were O
observed O
in O
any O
of O
the O
eight O
safety O
studies O
performed O
at O
doses O
up O
to O
10% O
of O
the O
diets. O
On O
the O
basis O
of O
these O
toxicity B-Disease
studies, O
human B-Species
studies O
in O
which O
doses O
of O
trehalose B-Chemical
were O
administered O
to O
various O
populations, O
and O
consumption O
of O
trehalose B-Chemical
in O
commercial O
products O
in O
Japan, O
it O
is O
concluded O
that O
trehalose B-Chemical
is O
safe O
for O
use O
as O
an O
ingredient O
in O
consumer O
products O
when O
used O
in O
accordance O
with O
current O
Good O
Manufacturing O
Practices. O
