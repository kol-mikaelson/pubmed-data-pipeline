# Abstract
An O
acyl-CoA O
hydrolase, O
referred O
to O
as O
hBACH, B-Gene
was O
purified O
from O
human B-Species
brain O
cytosol. O
The O
enzyme O
had O
a O
molecular O
mass O
of O
100 O
kDa O
and O
43-kDa O
subunits, O
and O
was O
highly O
active O
with O
long-chain O
acyl-CoAs, B-Chemical
e.g. O
a O
maximal O
velocity O
of O
295 O
micromol O
min O
mg O
and O
K(m) O
of O
6.4 O
microM O
for O
palmitoyl-CoA. B-Chemical
Acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
with O
carbon B-Chemical
chain O
lengths O
of O
C(8-18) O
were O
also O
good O
substrates. O
In O
human B-Species
brain O
cytosol, O
85% O
of O
palmitoyl-CoA B-Chemical
hydrolase O
activity O
was O
titrated O
by O
an O
anti-BACH O
antibody, O
which O
accounted O
for O
over O
75% O
of O
the O
enzyme O
activity O
found O
in O
the O
brain O
tissue. O
The O
cDNA O
isolated O
for O
hBACH, B-Gene
when O
expressed O
in O
Escherichia O
coli, B-Species
directed O
the O
expression O
of O
palmitoyl-CoA B-Chemical
hydrolase O
activity O
and O
a O
44-kDa O
protein O
immunoreactive O
to O
the O
anti-BACH O
antibody, O
which O
in O
turn O
neutralized O
the O
hydrolase O
activity. O
The O
hBACH B-Gene
cDNA O
encoded O
a O
338-amino O
acid O
sequence O
which O
was O
95% O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
a O
rat B-Species
homolog. O
The O
hBACH B-Gene
gene O
spanned O
about O
130 O
kb O
and O
comprised O
9 O
exons, O
and O
was O
mapped O
to O
1p36.2 O
on O
the O
cytogenetic O
ideogram. O
These O
findings O
indicate O
that O
the O
long-chain O
acyl-CoA O
hydrolase O
present O
in O
the O
brain O
is O
well O
conserved O
between O
man O
and O
the O
rat, B-Species
suggesting O
a O
conserved O
role O
for O
this O
enzyme O
in O
the O
mammalian O
brain, O
and O
enabling O
genetic O
studies O
on O
the O
functional O
analysis O
of O
acyl-CoA O
hydrolase. O
