# Abstract
Human B-Species
seminal O
plasma O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
(EC O
3.2.1.51) O
has O
been O
purified O
7100-fold O
to O

on O
agarose-epsilon-aminocaproyl-fucopyranosylamine. O
The O
purified O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
appeared O
to O
contain O
a O
single O
subunit O
of O
56-57 O
kDa O
(as O
determined O
by O
SDS-PAGE O
and O
Western O
analysis). O
Lectin O
blotting O
and O
N-glycanase O
treatment O
studies O
indicated O
that O
this O
subunit O
is O
N-glycosylated O
and O
contains O
sialic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
residues. O
Human B-Species
seminal O
plasma O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
was O
shown O
to O
contain O
three O
multimeric O
forms O
of O
110, O
236 O
and O
314 O
kDa O
respectively O
(as O
determined O
by O
Sephadex B-Chemical
G-200 I-Chemical
chromatography) O
and O
therefore O
probably O
exists O
in O
dimeric, O
tetrameric O
and O
hexameric O
forms. O
Kinetic O

with O
the O
4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-L-fucopyranoside B-Chemical
(4MU-Fuc) B-Chemical
substrate O
indicated O
a O
broad O

with O
a O
second O

(pH O
6.4-7.4) O

Apparent O

Isoelectric O

neuraminidase O
treatment O
studies O
provided O
further O
evidence O
that O
the O
purified O
seminal O
plasma O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
is O
a O
sialoglycoprotein O
with O
several O
isoforms O
between O
pI O

5-7. O
The O
acidic O
isoforms O
between O

appear O
to O
be O
related O
chemically O
to O
the O
more O
neutral O
isoforms O
by O
sialic B-Chemical

since O
neuraminidase O
treatment O
converted O
the O
former O

the O
latter O
isoforms. O
