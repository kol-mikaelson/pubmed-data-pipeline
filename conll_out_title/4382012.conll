# Abstract
1. O
The O
occurrence O
of O
five O
enzymes O
of O
the O
pentose B-Chemical
phosphate I-Chemical
pathway O
in O
cell-free O
preparations O
of O
the O
mucosa O
of O
rat B-Species
small O
intestine O
is O
described. O
These O
enzymes O
were O
found O
to O
be O
localized O
mainly O
in O
the O
supernatant O
fraction O
(6240000g-min.). O
2. O
The O
properties O
of O
glucose B-Gene
6-phosphate I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
and O
6-phosphogluconate O
dehydrogenase O
were O
studied O
with O
respect O
to O
K(m) O
values O
for O
substrates O
and O
NADP(+), B-Chemical

and O
the O
effects O
of O
p-chloromercuribenzoate B-Chemical
and O
palmitoyl-CoA. B-Chemical
Higher O

these O
two O

were O
noted O
in O
the O
proximal O

half. O
3. O
The O

compared. O
4. O
In O
the O
rat B-Species
the O
specific O
activities O
of O
ribose B-Gene
5-phosphate I-Gene
isomerase, I-Gene
transketolase B-Gene
and O
transaldolase B-Gene
were O
higher O
in O
the O
supernatant O

liver. O
5. O
The O
role O
of O
the O
pentose B-Chemical
