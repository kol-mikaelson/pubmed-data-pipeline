# Abstract
Since O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
K(+) O
shifts O
with O
exercise O
are O
extensive O
and O
can O
cause O
more O
than O
a O
doubling O
of O
the O
extracellular O
[K(+)] O
([K(+)](s)) O
as O
reviewed O
here, O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
these O
shifts O
may O
cause O
fatigue B-Disease
through O
the O
effect O
on O
muscle O
excitability O
and O
action O
potentials O
(AP). O
The O
cause O
of O
the O
K(+) O
shifts O
is O
a O
transient O
or O
long-lasting O
mismatch O
between O
outward O
repolarizing O
K(+) O
currents O
and O
K(+) O
influx O
carried O
by O
the O
Na(+)-K(+) O
pump. O
Several O
factors O
modify O
the O
effect O
of O
raised O
[K(+)](s) O
during O
exercise O
on O
membrane O
potential O
(E(m)) O
and O
force O
production. O
1) O
Membrane O
conductance O
to O
K(+) O
is O
variable O
and O
controlled O
by O
various O
K(+) O
channels. O
Low O
relative O
K(+) O
conductance O
will O
reduce O
the O
contribution O
of O
[K(+)](s) O
to O
the O
E(m). O
In O
addition, O
high O
Cl(-) O
conductance O
may O
stabilize O
the O
E(m) O
during O
brief O
periods O
of O
large O
K(+) O
shifts. O
2) O
The O
Na(+)-K(+) O
pump O
contributes O
with O
a O
hyperpolarizing O
current. O
3) O
Cell O
swelling O
accompanies O
muscle O
contractions O
especially O
in O
fast-twitch O
muscle, O
although O
little O
in O
the O
heart. O
This O
will O
contribute O
considerably O
to O
the O
lowering O
of O
intracellular O
[K(+)] O
([K(+)](c)) O
and O
will O
attenuate O
the O
exercise-induced O
rise O
of O
intracellular O
[Na(+)] O
([Na(+)](c)). O
4) O
The O
rise O
of O
[Na(+)](c) O
is O
sufficient O
to O
activate O
the O
Na(+)-K(+) O
pump O
to O
completely O
compensate O
increased O
K(+) O
release O
in O
the O
heart, O
yet O
not O
in O
skeletal O
muscle. O
In O
skeletal O
muscle O
there O
is O
strong O
evidence O
for O
control O
of O
pump O
activity O
not O
only O
through O
hormones, O
but O
through O
a O
hitherto O
unidentified O
mechanism. O
5) O
Ionic O
shifts O
within O
the O
skeletal O
muscle O
t O
tubules O
and O
in O
the O
heart O
in O
extracellular O
clefts O
may O
markedly O
affect O
excitation-contraction O
coupling. O
6) O
Age O
and O
state O
of O
training O
together O
with O
nutritional O
state O
modify O
muscle O
K(+) O
content O
and O
the O
abundance O
of O
Na(+)-K(+) O
pumps. O
We O
conclude O
that O
despite O
modifying O
factors O
coming O
into O
play O
during O
muscle O
activity, O
the O
K(+) O
shifts O
with O
high-intensity O
exercise O
may O
contribute O
substantially O
to O
fatigue B-Disease
in O
skeletal O
muscle, O
whereas O
in O
the O
heart, O
except O
during O
ischemia, O
the O
K(+) O
balance O
is O
controlled O
much O
more O
effectively. O
