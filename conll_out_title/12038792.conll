# Abstract
Platelets O
contain O
two O
cAMP B-Chemical
phosphodiesterases O
(PDEs) O
which O
regulate O
intracellular O
cAMP B-Chemical
levels, O
cGMP-inhibited O
cAMP B-Chemical
PDE B-Gene
(PDE3A) B-Gene
and O
cGMP-stimulated O
PDE B-Gene
(PDE2A). B-Gene
Using O
the O
PDE3 O
inhibitor, O
milrinone B-Chemical
and O
the O
PDE2 O
inhibitor, O
erythro-9-(2-hydroxyl-3-nonyl)adenine B-Chemical
(EHNA), B-Chemical
we O
have O
explored O
the O
contribution O
of O
each O
PDE B-Gene
to O
the O
regulation O
of O
platelet O
function. O
Inhibition O
of O
PDE2 O
resulted O
in O
higher O
levels O
of O
intracellular O
cAMP B-Chemical
than O
inhibition O
of O
PDE3A B-Gene
suggesting O
this O
PDE B-Gene
may O
be O
the O
more O
important O
regulator O
of O
cAMP B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
platelets. O
However, O
a O
concentration-dependent O
inhibition O
of O
agonist-induced O
aggregation O
was O
observed O
with O
milrinone B-Chemical
while O
little O
effect O
was O
seen O
with O
EHNA. B-Chemical
In O
addition, O
we O
observed O
a O
concentration-dependent O
inhibition O
in O
the O
increase O
of O
intracellular O
Ca2+ B-Chemical
with O
PDE3 O
inhibition O
and O
significantly O
less O
with O
PDE2 O
inhibition. O
PDE3 O
inhibition O
also O
resulted O
in O
a O
concentration-dependent O
increase O
in O
cAMP-mediated O
phosphorylation O
of O
the O
vasodilator-stimulated B-Gene
phospho-protein I-Gene
(VASP) B-Gene
whereas O
there O
was O
no O
significant O
increase O
with O
PDE2 O
inhibition. O
In O
each O
of O
these O
experiments, O
synergism O
was O
noted O
with O
the O
combination O
of O
milrinone B-Chemical
and O
EHNA. B-Chemical
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
cAMP B-Chemical
pools O
may O
be O
localized O
and O
the O
various O
PDEs O
regulate O
specific O
pools. O
These O
data O
also O
suggest O
that O
inhibitors O
of O
PDE3A B-Gene
may O
be O
more O
effective O
antiplatelet O
agents. O
