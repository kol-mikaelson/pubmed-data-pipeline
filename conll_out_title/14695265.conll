# Abstract
Monocarboxylate B-Gene

In O

be O
involved O
in O
the O
shuttling O

and O

The O
NBC B-Chemical
cotransports O
bicarbonate B-Chemical

sodium B-Chemical
and O
generates O
a O

We O
have O

We O

stimulates O

Lactate B-Chemical

increased O

when O

Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
facilitation O
of O
MCT1 B-Gene
transport O
activity O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
increase O
in O
apparent O
buffer O
capacity O
contributed O
by O
the O
NBC, B-Chemical
and O
thereby O
suppresses O
the O
build-up O
of O
intracellular O
H+ O
during O
the O
influx O
of O
lactate B-Chemical
H+, O
which O
would O
reduce O
MCT1 B-Gene
activity. O
Hence O
these O
membrane O
transporters O
functionally O
cooperate O
and O
are O
able O
to O
increase O
ion O
metabolite O
transport O
activity. O
