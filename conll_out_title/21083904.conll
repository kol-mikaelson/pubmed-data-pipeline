# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Medium B-Disease
chain I-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
(MCADD) B-Disease
is O
a O
disorder O
of O
mitochondrial O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
and O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
of I-Disease
metabolism. I-Disease
Identification O
of O
MCADD B-Disease
via O
newborn O
screening O
permits O
the O
introduction O
of O
interventions O
that O
can O
significantly O
reduce O
associated O
morbidity O
and O
mortality. O
This O
study O
reports O
on O
the O
first O
three O
years O
of O
newborn O
screening O
for O
MCADD B-Disease
in O
Ontario, O
Canada. O
METHODS: O
Newborn O
Screening O
Ontario O
began O
screening O
for O
MCADD B-Disease
in O
April O
2006, O
by O
quantification O
of O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
(primarily O
octanoylcarnitine, B-Chemical
C8) B-Chemical
in O
dried O
blood O
spots O
using O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry. O
Babies O
with O
positive O
screening O
results O
were O
referred O
to O
physicians O
at O
one O
of O
five O
regional O
Newborn O
Screening O
Treatment O
Centres, O
who O
were O
responsible O
for O
diagnostic O
evaluation O
and O
follow-up O
care. O
RESULTS: O
From O
April O
2006 O
through O
March O
2009, O
approximately O
439 O
000 O
infants O
were O
screened O
for O
MCADD B-Disease
in O
Ontario. O
Seventy-four O
infants O
screened O
positive, O
with O
a O
median O
C8 B-Chemical
level O
of O
0.68 O
uM O
(range O
0.33-30.41 O
uM). O
Thirty-one O
of O
the O
screen O
positive O
infants O
have O
been O
confirmed O
to O
have O
MCADD, B-Disease
while O
36 O
have O
been O
confirmed O
to O
be O
unaffected. O
Screening O
C8 B-Chemical
levels O
were O
higher O
among O
infants O
with O
MCADD B-Disease
(median O
8.93 O
uM) O
compared O
to O
those O
with O
false O
positive O
results O
(median O
0.47 O
uM). O
Molecular O
testing O
was O
available O
for O
29 O
confirmed O
cases O
of O
MCADD, B-Disease
15 O
of O
whom O
were O
homozygous O
for O
the O
common O
c.985A B-DNAMutation
> I-DNAMutation
G I-DNAMutation
mutation. O
Infants O
homozygous O
for O
the O
common O
mutation O
tended O
to O
have O
higher O
C8 B-Chemical
levels O
(median O
12.13 O
uM) O
relative O
to O
compound O
heterozygotes O
for O
c.985A B-DNAMutation
> I-DNAMutation
G I-DNAMutation
and O
a O
second O
detectable O
mutation O
(median O
2.01 O
uM). O
Eight O
confirmed O
mutation O
carriers O
were O
identified O
among O
infants O
in O
the O
false O
positive O
group. O
The O
positive O
predictive O
value O
of O
a O
screen O
positive O
for O
MCADD B-Disease
was O
46%. O
The O
estimated O
birth O
prevalence O
of O
MCADD B-Disease
in O
Ontario O
is O
approximately O
1 O
in O
14 O
000. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
birth O
prevalence O
of O
MCADD B-Disease
and O
positive O
predictive O
value O
of O
the O
screening O
test O
were O
similar O
to O
those O
identified O
by O
other O
newborn O
screening O
programs O
internationally. O
We O
observed O
some O
evidence O
of O
correlation O
between O
genotype O
and O
biochemical O
phenotype O
(C8 B-Chemical
levels), O
and O
between O
C8 B-Chemical
screening O
levels O
and O
eventual O
diagnosis. O
Current O
research O
priorities O
include O
further O
examining O
the O
relationships O
among O
genotype, O
biochemical O
phenotype, O
and O
clinical O
phenotype, O
with O
the O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
improving O
clinical O
risk O
prediction O
in O
order O
to O
provide O
tailored O
disease O
management O
advice O
and O
genetic O
counselling O
to O
families. O
