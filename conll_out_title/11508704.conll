# Abstract
A O
cDNA O
encoding O
beta-ureidopropionase B-Gene
(BUP) O
was O
isolated O
from O
a O
human B-Species
liver O
cDNA O
library, O
expressed O
in O
E. O
coli, B-Species
and O
purified O
from O
the O
culture O
extract. O
The O
2,006 O
bp O
cDNA O
contained O
a O
1,152 O
bp O
open O
reading O
frame O
encoding O
a O
protein O
of O
384 O
amino O
acids O
with O
a O
molecular O
weight O
of O
43,165 O
Da. O
The O
subunit O
molecular O
weight O
of O
the O
enzyme O
expressed O
was O
about O
43,000 O
Da. O
The O
enzyme O
was O
inhibited O
by O
1 O
mM O
propionate, B-Chemical
but O
not O
by O
10 O
mM O
beta-alanine. B-Chemical
Chemical O
analysis O
of O
the O
purified O
human B-Species
BUP O
showed O
0.54 O
zinc O
atoms O
per O
subunit, O
and O
the O
sequence O
of O
BUP O
cDNA O
contained O
one O
putative O
zinc-binding O
site O
motif. O
The O
purified O
enzyme O
had O
a O
pI O
of O
5.65, O
and O
exhibited O
positive O
cooperativity O
with O
N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine B-Chemical
as O
the O
substrate O
with O
a O
Hill O
coefficient O
2.0. O
These O
properties O
of O
human B-Species
BUP, O
except O
the O
inhibition O
by O
beta-alanine, B-Chemical
were O
similar O
to O
the O
rat B-Species
liver O
purified O
enzyme. O
Beta-alanine B-Chemical
inhibits O
rats B-Species
BUP O
activity. O
The O
complex O
regulatory O
function O
and O
the O
negative O
cooperative O
mechanism O
of O
BUP O
by O
beta-alanine B-Chemical
have O
been O
observed O
in O
rats. B-Species
This O
kind O
of O
mechanism O
may O
not O
exist O
in O
humans, O
because O
beta-alanine B-Chemical
did O
not O
inhibit O
human B-Species
BUP. O
