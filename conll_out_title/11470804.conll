# Abstract
In O
this O
study, O
we O
identified O
and O
characterized O
two O
murine B-Species
cDNAs O
encoding O
medium-chain B-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
synthetase I-Gene
(MACS). B-Gene
One, O
designated O
MACS1, B-Gene
is O
a O
novel O
protein O
and O
the O
other O
the O
product O
of O
the O
Sa B-Gene
gene O
(Sa B-Gene
protein), O
which O
is O
preferentially O
expressed O
in O
spontaneously O
hypertensive B-Disease
rats. B-Species
Based O
on O
the O
murine B-Species
MACS1 B-Gene
sequence, O
we O
also O
identified O
the O
location O
and O
organization O
of O
the O
human B-Species
MACS1 B-Gene
gene, O
showing O
that O
the O
human B-Species
MACS1 B-Gene
and O
Sa B-Gene
genes O
are O
located O
in O
the O
opposite O
transcriptional O
direction O
within O
a O
150-kilobase O
region O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
16p13.1. I-Chromosome
Murine B-Species
MACS1 B-Gene
and O
Sa B-Gene
protein O
were O
overexpressed O
in O
COS B-CellLine
cells, O
purified O
to O
homogeneity, O
and O
characterized. O
Among O
C4-C16 B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
MACS1 B-Gene
preferentially O
utilizes O
octanoate, B-Chemical
whereas O
isobutyrate B-Chemical
is O
the O
most O
preferred O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
among O
C2-C6 B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
for O
Sa B-Gene
protein. O
Like O
Sa B-Gene
gene O
transcript, O
MACS1 B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
detected O
mainly O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
kidney. O
Subcellular O
fractionation O
revealed O
that O
both O
MACS1 B-Gene
and O
Sa B-Gene
protein O
are O
localized O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix. O
(14)C-Fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
incorporation O
studies O
indicated O
that O
acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
produced O
by O
MACS1 B-Gene
and O
Sa B-Gene
protein O
are O
utilized O
mainly O
for O
oxidation. O
