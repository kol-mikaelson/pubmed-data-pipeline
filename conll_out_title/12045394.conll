# Abstract
Steroid B-Chemical
hormones I-Chemical
are O
believed O
to O
enter O
cells O
solely O
by O
free O
diffusion O
through O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
However, O
recent O
work O
on O
the O
uptake O
of O
25-hydroxyvitamin B-Chemical
D3 I-Chemical
into O
the O
kidney O
has O
identified O
an O
endocytic O
pathway O
that O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
delivery O
of O
this O
steroid B-Chemical
to O
renal O
tissues. O
This O
finding O
led O
to O
a O
new O
perception O
that O
endocytosis O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
cell-type-specific O
targeting O
and O
uptake O
of O
steroid B-Chemical
hormones. I-Chemical
In O
the O
present O
review, O
we O
describe O
the O
molecular O
components O
(e.g. O
steroid B-Chemical
carriers, O
endocytic O
receptors O
and O
intracellular O
transport O
proteins) O
that O
constitute O
this O
novel O
pathway O
for O
tissue-specific O
uptake O
of O
vitamin O
D O
metabolites. O
