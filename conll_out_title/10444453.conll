# Abstract
In O
the O
present O
report, O
we O
describe O
the O
cloning O
of O
a O
human B-Species
colonic O
cDNA O
that O
describes O
the O
full-length O
Na(+) O
H(+) O
exchanger O
(NHE) B-Gene
2 I-Gene
coding O
region. O
The O
human B-Species
NHE2 B-Gene
(hNHE2) O
cDNA O
encodes O
for O
a O
polypeptide O
of O
812 O
amino O
acids O
with O
a O

to O
both O
rabbit B-Species
and O

NHE2 B-Gene
isoforms. O
In O
comparison O
with O
SLC9A2, B-Gene
recently O
reported O
as O
the O
human B-Species
NHE2, B-Gene
the O
hNHE2 O
polypeptide O
is O
115 O
amino O

longer O
in O
the O
NH(2)-terminal O

and O
shows O
only O
an O

revealed O
that O
hNHE2 O

has O
an O
uneven O

distribution, O
with O
high O

in O
the O
skeletal O

in O
the O
testis, O
prostate, O
ovary, O
and O

studies O
with O
hNHE2 O
clone O
showed O
that O
a O
75-kDa O
protein O
was O
expressed. O

These O
data O
indicate O
that O
this O
cDNA O
is O
the O
true O
human B-Species

and O
that O
