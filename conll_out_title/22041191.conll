# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Genome-scale O
metabolic O
reconstructions O
provide O
a O
biologically O
meaningful O
mechanistic O
basis O
for O
the O
genotype-phenotype O
relationship. O
The O
global O
human B-Species
metabolic O
network, O
termed O
Recon O
1, O
has O
recently O
been O
reconstructed O
allowing O
the O
systems O
analysis O
of O
human B-Species
metabolic O
physiology O
and O
pathology. O
Utilizing O
high-throughput O
data, O
Recon O
1 O
has O
recently O
been O
tailored O
to O
different O
cells O
and O
tissues, O
including O
the O
liver, O
kidney, O
brain, O
and O
alveolar O
macrophage. O
These O
models O
have O
shown O
utility O
in O
the O
study O
of O
systems O
medicine. O
However, O
no O
integrated O
analysis O
between O
human B-Species
tissues O
has O
been O
done. O
RESULTS: O
To O
describe O
tissue-specific O
functions, O
Recon O
1 O
was O
tailored O
to O
describe O
metabolism O
in O
three O
human B-Species
cells: O
adipocytes, O
hepatocytes, O
and O
myocytes. O
These O
cell-specific O
networks O
were O
manually O
curated O
and O
validated O
based O
on O
known O
cellular O
metabolic O
functions. O
To O
study O
intercellular O
interactions, O
a O
novel O
multi-tissue O
type O
modeling O
approach O
was O
developed O
to O
integrate O
the O
metabolic O
functions O
for O
the O
three O
cell O
types, O
and O
subsequently O
used O
to O
simulate O
known O
integrated O
metabolic O
cycles. O
In O
addition, O
the O
multi-tissue O
model O
was O
used O
to O
study O
diabetes: B-Disease
a O
pathology O
with O
systemic O
properties. O
High-throughput O
data O
was O
integrated O
with O
the O
network O
to O
determine O
differential O
metabolic O
activity O
between O
obese B-Disease
and O
type O
II O
obese B-Disease
gastric O
bypass O
patients O
in O
a O
whole-body O
context. O
CONCLUSION: O
The O
multi-tissue O
type O
modeling O
approach O
presented O
provides O
a O
platform O
to O
study O
integrated O
metabolic O
states. O
As O
more O
cell O
and O
tissue-specific O
models O
are O
released, O
it O
is O
critical O
to O
develop O
a O
framework O
in O
which O
to O
study O
their O
interdependencies. O
