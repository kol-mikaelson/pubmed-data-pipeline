# Abstract
Chondroitin B-Chemical
4-sulfotransferase O
(C4ST) B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
transfer O
of O
sulfate B-Chemical
from O
3'-phosphoadenosine B-Chemical
5'-phosphosulfate I-Chemical
to O
position O
4 O
of O
the O
N-acetylgalactosamine B-Chemical
residues O
of O
chondroitin. B-Chemical
We O
previously O
reported O
the O
cloning O
of O
C4ST B-Gene
cDNA O
from O
mouse B-Species
brain. O
We O
here O
report O
the O
cloning O
and O
expression O
of O
human B-Species
C4ST B-Gene
cDNA. O
The O
cDNA O
was O
isolated O
from O
a O
human B-Species
fetal O
brain O
cDNA O
library O
by O
hybridization O
with O
a O
DNA O
probe O
prepared O
from O
rat B-Species
poly(A)(+) B-Chemical
RNA O
used O
for O
the O
cloning O
of O
mouse B-Species
C4ST B-Gene
cDNA. O
The O
cDNA O
comprises O
a O
single O
open O
reading O
frame O
that O
predicts O
a O
Type O
II O
transmembrane O
protein O
composed O
of O
352 O
amino O
acids. O
The O
protein O
has O
an O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
homology O
of O
96% O
with O
mouse B-Species
C4ST. B-Gene
When O
the O
cDNA O
was O
introduced O
into O
a O
eukaryotic O
expression O
vector O
and O
transfected O
in O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells, O
the O
sulfotransferase O
activity O
that O
transfers O
sulfate B-Chemical
to O
both O
chondroitin B-Chemical
and O
desulfated B-Chemical
dermatan I-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
was O
overexpressed. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
indicated O
that O
human B-Species
C4ST B-Gene
mRNAs O
(6.0 O
and O
1.9 O
kb) O
are O
expressed O
ubiquitously O
in O
various O
adult O
human B-Species
tissues. O
Dot O
blot O
analysis O
has O
shown O
that O
human B-Species
C4ST B-Gene
is O
strongly O
expressed O
in O
colorectal B-Disease
adenocarcinoma I-Disease
and O
peripheral O
blood O
leukocytes, O
whereas O
strong O
expression O
of O
human B-Species
chondroitin B-Gene
6-sulfotransferase I-Gene
(C6ST) B-Gene
is O
observed O
in O
aorta O
and O
testis. O
These O
observations O
suggest O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
C4ST B-Gene
and O
C6ST B-Gene
may O
be O
controlled O
differently O
in O
human B-Species
tissues. O
The O
C4ST B-Gene
gene O
was O
localized O
to O
chromosome O
12q23.2-q23.3 O
by O
fluorescence O
in O
situ O
hybridization. O
