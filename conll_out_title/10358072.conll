# Abstract
We O
have O
isolated O
a O
novel O
liver-specific O
organic O
anion O
transporter, O
LST-1, B-Gene
that O
is O
expressed O
exclusively O
in O
the O
human, B-Species
rat, B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
liver. O
LST-1 B-Gene
is O
a O
new O
gene O
family O
located O
between O
the O
organic O
anion O
transporter O
family O
and O
prostaglandin O
transporter. O
LST-1 B-Gene
transports O
taurocholate B-Chemical
(Km O
= O
13.6 O
microM) O
in O
a O
sodium-independent O
manner. O
LST-1 B-Gene
also O
shows O
broad O
substrate O
specificity. O
It O
transports O
conjugated B-Chemical
steroids I-Chemical
(dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
sulfate, I-Chemical
estradiol-17beta-glucuronide, O
and O
estrone-3-sulfate), B-Chemical
eicosanoids B-Chemical
(prostaglandin B-Chemical
E2, I-Chemical
thromboxane B-Chemical
B2, I-Chemical
leukotriene B-Chemical
C4, I-Chemical
leukotriene B-Chemical
E4), I-Chemical
and O
thyroid O
hormones O
(thyroxine, B-Chemical
Km O
= O
3.0 O
microM O
and O
triiodothyronine, B-Chemical
Km O
= O
2.7 O
microM), O
reflecting O
hepatic O
multispecificity. O
LST-1 B-Gene
is O
probably O
the O
most O
important O
transporter O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
for O
clearance O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
organic O
anions O
because O
hepatic O
levels O
of O
another O
organic O
anion O
transporter, O
OATP, B-Gene
is O
very O
low. O
This O
is O
also O
the O
first O
report O
of O
the O
human B-Species
molecule O
that O
transports O
thyroid O
hormones. O
