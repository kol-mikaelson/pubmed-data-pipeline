# Abstract
Concentrative O
and O
Equilibrative O
Nucleoside B-Chemical
Transporter O
proteins O
(CNT O
and O
ENT, O
respectively) O
are O
encoded O
by O
gene O
families O
SLC28 O
and O
SLC29. O
They O
mediate O
the O
uptake O
of O
natural O
nucleosides B-Chemical
and O
a O
variety O
of O
nucleoside-derived O
drugs, O
mostly O
used O
in O
anticancer O
therapy. O
CNT O
and O
ENT O
proteins O
are O
mostly O
localized O
in O
the O
apical O
and O
basolateral O
sides, O
respectively, O
in O
(re)absorptive O
epithelia. O
This O
anatomic O
distribution O
determines O
nucleoside B-Chemical
and O
nucleoside-derived O
vectorial O
flux. O
CNT O
expression O
(particularly O
CNT2) B-Gene
is O
associated O
with O
differentiation O
and O
is O
also O
nutritionally O
regulated O
in O
intestinal O
epithelia, O
whereas O
ENT O
protein O
amounts O
(mostly O
ENT1) B-Gene
are O
increased O
when O
cells O
are O
exposed O
to O
proliferative O
stimuli O
such O
as O
EGF, B-Gene
TGF-alpha B-Gene
or O
wounding. O
Although O
all O
these O
features O
suggest O
a O
role O
for O
NT O
proteins O
in O
nucleoside B-Chemical
salvage O
and O
(re)absorption, O
recent O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
CNT2 B-Gene
might O
be O
under O
purinergic O
control, O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
is O
dependent O
on O
energy O
metabolism. O
A O
physiological O
link O
between O
CNT2 B-Gene
function O
and O
intracellular O
metabolism O
is O
also O
supported O
by O
the O
evidence O
that O
extracellular O
adenosine B-Chemical
can O
activate O
the O
AMP-dependent B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
(AMPK), B-Gene
by O
a O
mechanism O
which O
relies O
upon O
adenosine B-Chemical
transport O
and O
phosphorylation. O
Thus O
the O
complex O
pattern O
of O
NT O
isoform O
expression O
in O
mammalian O
cells O
can O
fulfill O
physiological O
roles O
other O
than O
salvage. O
