# Abstract
Adenylate O
kinases O
have O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
synthesis O
of O
adenine B-Chemical
nucleotides I-Chemical
that O
are O
required O
for O
cellular O
metabolism. O
We O
report O
the O
cDNA O
cloning O
of O
a O
novel O
22-kDa O
human B-Species
enzyme O
that O
is O
sequence O
related O
to O
the O
human B-Species
adenylate O
kinases O
and O
to O
UMP B-Gene
CMP B-Chemical
kinase I-Gene
of O
several O
species. O
The O
enzyme O
was O
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
shown O
to O
catalyse O
phosphorylation O
of O
AMP B-Chemical
and O
dAMP B-Chemical
with O
ATP B-Chemical
as O
phosphate B-Chemical
donor. O
When O
GTP B-Chemical
was O
used O
as O
phosphate B-Chemical
donor, O
the O
enzyme O
phosphorylated O
AMP, B-Chemical
CMP, B-Chemical
and O
to O
a O
small O
extent O
dCMP. B-Chemical
Expression O
as O
a O
fusion O
protein O
with O
the O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
showed O
that O
the O
enzyme O
is O
located O
in O
the O
cytosol. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
with O
mRNA O
from O
eight O
different O
human B-Species
tissues O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
enzyme O
was O
expressed O
exclusively O
in O
brain, O
with O
two O
mRNA O
isoforms O
of O
2.4 O
and O
4.0 O
kb. O
The O
gene O
that O
encoded O
the O
enzyme O
was O
localized O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
1p31. I-Chromosome
Based O
on O
the O
substrate O
specificity O
and O
the O
sequence O
similarity O
with O
the O
previously O
identified O
human B-Species
adenylate O
kinases, O
we O
have O
named O
this O
novel O
enzyme O
adenylate B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
