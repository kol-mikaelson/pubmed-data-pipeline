# Abstract
The O
degradation O
of O
L-ascorbate B-Chemical
(AsA) B-Chemical
and O
its O
primary O
oxidation O
products, O
L-dehydroascorbate B-Chemical
(DHA) B-Chemical
and O
2,3-L-diketogulonate B-Chemical
(2, B-Chemical
3-DKG) I-Chemical
were O
studied O
under O
physiological O
conditions. O
Analysis O
determined O
that O
L-erythrulose B-Chemical
(ERU) B-Chemical
and O
oxalate B-Chemical
were O
the O
primary O
degradation O
products O
of O
ASA B-Chemical
regardless O
of O
which O
compound O
was O
used O
as O
the O
starting O
material. O
The O
identification O
of O
ERU B-Chemical
was O
determined O
by O
proton O
decoupled O
(13)C-nuclear O
magnetic O
resonance O
spectroscopy, O
and O
was O
quantified O
by O
high O
performance O
liquid O
chromatography, O
and O
enzymatic O
analysis. O
The O
molar O
yield O
of O
ERU B-Chemical
from O
2,3-DKG B-Chemical
at O
pH O
7.0 O
37 O
degrees O
C O
and O
limiting O
O(2)97%. O
This O
novel O
ketose B-Chemical
product O
of O
AsA B-Chemical
degradation, O
was O
additionally O
qualitatively O
identified O
by O
gas-liquid O
chromatography, O
and O
by O
thin O
layer O
chromatography. O
ERU B-Chemical
is O
an O
extremely O
reactive O
ketose, B-Chemical
which O
rapidly O
glycates O
and O
crosslinks O
proteins, O
and O
therefore O
may O
mediate O
the O
AsA-dependent O
modification O
of O
protein O
(ascorbylation) O
seen O
in O
vitro, O
and O
also O
proposed O
to O
occur O
in O
vivo O
in O
human B-Species
lens O
during O
diabetic B-Disease
and O
age-onset O
cataract B-Disease
formation. O
