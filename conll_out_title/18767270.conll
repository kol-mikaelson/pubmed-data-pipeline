# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Medium B-Disease
Chain I-Disease
Acyl-CoA I-Disease
Dehydrogenase I-Disease
(MCAD) B-Disease
Deficiency I-Disease
is O
an O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation, O
with O
potential O
fatal O
outcome. O
MCAD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
diagnosed O
by O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
analysis O
on O
newborn O
screening O
blood O
spot O
cards O
by O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry. O
Early O
diagnosis O
of O
MCAD O
and O
presymptomatic O
treatment O
can O
potentially O
reduce O
morbidity O
and O
mortality. O
OBJECTIVES: O
To O
evaluate O
incidence, O
clinical O
outcome, O
biochemical O
and O
molecular O
phenotype O
of O
MCAD O
cases O
detected O
in O
the O
first O
three O
years O
of O
newborn O
screening O
in O
British O
Columbia O
(BC). O
METHODS O
AND O
RESULTS: O
Medium O
chain O
length O
acylcarnitines, B-Chemical
octanoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(C8) B-Chemical
and O
decanoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(C10), O
were O
measured O
on O
newborn O
screening O
blood O
spot O
cards. O
Out O
of O
121,000 O
live O
births, O
17 O
newborns O
had O
C8 B-Chemical
values O
above O
the O
screening O
cut-off O
of O
0.38 O
umol O
L. O
Ten O
newborns O
had O
elevated O
C8 B-Chemical
on O
repeat O
cards O
and O
were O
investigated O
further. O
Both O
C8 B-Chemical
and O
C8 B-Chemical
C10 O
ratios O
remained O
abnormal O
in O
all O
confirmed O
MCAD O
cases. O
Positive O
predictive O
value O
of O
screening O
was O
58% O
with O
no O
false O
negative O
results. O
Seven O
patients B-Species
were O
homozygous O
for O
the O
common O
c.985A B-DNAMutation
> I-DNAMutation
G I-DNAMutation
MCAD O
mutation O
and O
three O
others O
were O
compound O
heterozygous O
for O
the O
c.985A B-DNAMutation
> I-DNAMutation
G I-DNAMutation
and O
a O
second O
mutation. O
Two O
novel O
mutations O
were O
identified O
(c.260T B-DNAMutation
> I-DNAMutation
C I-DNAMutation
and O
c.382T B-DNAMutation
> I-DNAMutation
A). I-DNAMutation
The O
estimated O
incidence O
of O
MCAD O
was O
approximately O
1:12,000 O
live O
births. O
Upon O
frequent O
feeding O
and O
carnitine B-Chemical
supplementation, O
none O
of O
the O
patients B-Species
had O
metabolic B-Disease
crises I-Disease
or O
adverse O
outcomes. O
CONCLUSION: O
Frequency O
of O
MCAD O
in O
BC O
is O
comparable O
to O
reports O
from O
other O
newborn O
screening O
programs. O
Persistence O
of O
elevated O
C8 B-Chemical
levels O
and O
C8 B-Chemical
C10 O
ratios O
in O
confirmed O
MCAD O
cases O
suggest O
that O
these O
are O
sensitive O
markers O
for O
newborn O
screening. O
Early O
detection O
and O
treatment O
have O
successfully O
prevented O
adverse O
health O
outcomes O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
MCAD. O
