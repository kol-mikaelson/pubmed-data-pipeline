# Abstract
In O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae, I-Species
phosphoacetylglucosamine B-Gene
mutase I-Gene
is O
encoded O
by O
an O
essential O
gene O
called O
AGM1. B-Gene
The O
human B-Species
AGM1 B-Gene
cDNA O
(HsAGM1) O
and O
the O
Candida B-Species
albicans I-Species
AGM1 B-Gene
gene O
(CaAGM1) O
were O
functionally O
cloned O
and O
characterized O
by O
using O
an O
S. B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
strain O
in O
which O
the O
endogenous O
phosphoacetylglucosamine B-Gene
mutase I-Gene
was O
depleted. O
When O
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
as O
fusion O
proteins O
with O
glutathione B-Gene
S-transferase, I-Gene
both O
HsAgm1 O
and O
CaAgm1 O
proteins O
displayed O
phosphoacetylglucosamine B-Gene
mutase I-Gene
activities, O
demonstrating O
that O
they O
indeed O
specify O
phosphoacetylglucosamine B-Gene
mutase. I-Gene
Sequence O
comparison O
of O
HsAgm1p O

several O
hexose-phosphate B-Chemical
mutases O
yielded O
three O
domains O
that O
are O
highly O
conserved O
among O
phosphoacetylglucosamine O
mutases O
and O
phosphoglucomutases O
of O
divergent O
organisms. O
Mutations O
of O
the O
conserved O
amino O
acids O
found O
in O
these O
domains, O
which O
were O
designated O
region O
I, O
II, O
and O

respectively, O
demonstrated O
that O

Asp(278), O
and O
Arg(281) O
in O
region O

of O
HsAgm1p O
severely O
diminished O
the O
enzyme O

and O
the O
ability O

S. B-Species

mutant. O
Conservative O
mutations O
of O
His(65) O
and O
Asp(276) O
restored O
detectable O
activities, O
whereas O
those O
of O
Ser(64), O
Asp(278), O
and O
Arg(281) O
did O
not. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
Ser(64), O
Asp(278), O
and O
Arg(281) O
of O
HsAgm1p O
are O
residues O
essential O
for O
the O
catalysis. O
Because O
Ser(64) O
corresponds O
to O
the O
phosphorylating O
serine O
in O
the O
E. B-Species
coli I-Species
phosphoglucosamine O
mutase, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
activation O
of O
HsAgm1p O
also O
requires O
phosphorylation O
on O
Ser(64). O
Furthermore, O
alanine B-ProteinMutation
substitution I-ProteinMutation
for I-ProteinMutation
Arg(496) I-ProteinMutation
in O
region O
III O
significantly O
increased O
the O
K(m) O
value O
for O
N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate, B-Chemical
demonstrating O
that O
Arg(496) O
serves O
as O
a O
binding O
site O
for O
N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate. B-Chemical
