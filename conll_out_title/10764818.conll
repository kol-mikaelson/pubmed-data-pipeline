# Abstract
We O
report O
the O
cDNA O
cloning O
and O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
inositol O
polyphosphate O
5-phosphatase O
(5-phosphatase) O
that O
has O
substrate O
specificity O
unlike O
previously O
described O
members O
of O
this O
large O
gene O
family. O
All O
previously O
described O
members O
hydrolyze O
water B-Chemical
soluble O
inositol B-Chemical
phosphates. I-Chemical
This O
enzyme O
hydrolyzes O
only O
lipid B-Chemical
substrates, O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4,5-trisphosphate I-Chemical
and O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
4,5-bisphosphate. I-Chemical
The O
cDNA O
isolated O
comprises O
3110 O
base O
pairs O
and O
predicts O
a O
protein O
product O
of O
644 O
amino O
acids O
and O
M(r) O
= O
70,023. O
We O
designate O
this O
5-phosphatase O
as O
type O
IV. O
It O
is O
a O
highly O
basic O
protein O
(pI O
= O
8.8) O
and O
has O
the O
greatest O
affinity O
toward O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4,5-trisphosphate I-Chemical
of O
known O
5-phosphatases. O
The O
K(m) O
is O
0.65 O
micrometer, O
1 O
10 O
that O
of O
SHIP B-Gene
(5.95 O
micrometer), O
another O
5-phosphatase O
that O
hydrolyzes O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4,5-trisphosphate. I-Chemical
The O
activity O
of O
5-phosphatase O
type O
IV O
is O
sensitive O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
detergents O
in O
the O
in O
vitro O
assay. O
Thus O
the O
enzyme O
hydrolyzes O
lipid B-Chemical
substrates O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
detergents O
or O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
n-octyl B-Chemical
beta-glucopyranoside I-Chemical
or O
Triton B-Chemical
X-100, I-Chemical
but O
not O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
cetyltriethylammonium B-Chemical
bromide, I-Chemical
the O
detergent O
that O
has O
been O
used O
in O
other O
studies O
of O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
4,5-bisphosphate. I-Chemical
Remarkably O
SHIP, B-Gene
a O
5-phosphatase O
previously O
characterized O
as O
hydrolyzing O
only O
substrates O
with O
d-3 B-Chemical
phosphates, I-Chemical
also O
readily O
hydrolyzed O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
4,5-bisphosphate I-Chemical
in O
the O
presence O
of O
n-octyl B-Chemical
beta-glucopyranoside I-Chemical
but O
not O
cetyltriethylammonium B-Chemical
bromide. I-Chemical
We O
used O
antibodies O
prepared O
against O
a O
peptide O
predicted O
by O
the O
cDNA O
to O
identify O
the O
5-phosphatase O
type O
IV O
enzyme O
in O
human B-Species
tissues O
and O
find O
that O
it O
is O
highly O
expressed O
in O
the O
brain O
as O
determined O
by O
Western O
blotting. O
We O
also O
performed O
Western O
blotting O
of O
mouse B-Species
tissues O
and O
found O
high O
levels O
of O
expression O
in O
the O
brain, O
testes, O
and O
heart O
with O
lower O
levels O
of O
expression O
in O
other O
tissues. O
mRNA O
was O
detected O
in O
many O
tissues O
and O
cell O
lines O
as O
determined O
by O
Northern O
blotting. O
