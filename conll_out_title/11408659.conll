# Abstract
Epidemiological O
data O
suggest O
that O
dietary O
antioxidants O
play O
a O
protective O
role O
against O
cancer. B-Disease
This O
has O
led O
to O
the O
proposal O
that O
dietary O
supplementation O
with O
antioxidants O
such O
as O
vitamin B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
(vit B-Chemical
C) I-Chemical
may O
be O
useful O
in O
disease O
prevention. O
However, O
vit B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
has O
proved O
to O
be O
ineffective O
in O
cancer B-Disease
chemoprevention O
studies. O
In O
addition, O
concerns O
have O
been O
raised O
over O
potentially O
deleterious O
transition B-Chemical
metal O
ion-mediated O
pro-oxidant O
effects. O
We O
have O
now O
determined O
that O
vit B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
induces O
lipid B-Chemical
hydroperoxide I-Chemical
decomposition O
to O
the O
DNA-reactive O
bifunctional O
electrophiles O
4-oxo-2-nonenal, B-Chemical
4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenal, B-Chemical
and O
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. B-Chemical
The O
compound O
4,5-Epoxy-2(E)-decenal B-Chemical
is O
a O
precursor O
of O
etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine, B-Chemical
a O
highly O
mutagenic O

found O
in O
