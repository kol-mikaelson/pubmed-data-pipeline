# Abstract
We O
found O
a O
novel O
glycosyltransferase O
gene O
having O
a O
hypothetical O
beta O
1,4-galactosyltransferase O
motif O
(GenBank O
accession O
number O
) O
by O
a O
BLAST O
search O
and O
cloned O
its O
full-length O
open O
reading O
frame O
using O
the O
5'-rapid O
amplification O
of O
cDNA O
ends O
method. O
The O
truncated O
form O
was O
expressed O
in O
insect B-CellLine
cells O
as O
a O
soluble O
enzyme. O
It O
transferred O
N-acetylgalactosamine, B-Chemical
not O
galactose, B-Chemical
to O
para-nitrophenyl-beta-glucuronic O
acid. O
The O
N-acetylgalactosamine-glucuronic O
acid O
linkage O
has O
been O
identified O
only O
in O
chondroitin B-Chemical
sulfate; I-Chemical
therefore, O
we O
examined O
its O
chondroitin B-Chemical
elongation O
and O
initiation O
activities. O
N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase O
activity O
was O
observed O
toward O
chondroitin B-Chemical
poly- I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
oligosaccharides, I-Chemical
chondroitin B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
oligosaccharides, I-Chemical
and O
linkage B-Chemical
tetrasaccharide I-Chemical
(GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-O-methoxyphenyl), B-Chemical
and O
the O
chondroitin B-Chemical
polysaccharide I-Chemical
and O
linkage B-Chemical
tetrasaccharide I-Chemical
were O
better O
acceptor O
substrates O
than O
the O
others. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
and O
quantitative O
real-time O
PCR O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
its O
4-kb O
transcripts O
were O
highly O
expressed O
in O
thyroid O
and O
placenta, O
although O
they O
were O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
in O
various O
tissues O
and O
cells. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
this O
enzyme O
has O
N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase O
activity O
in O
both O
the O
elongation O
and O
initiation O
of O
chondroitin B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
synthesis. O
Furthermore, O
we O
performed O
enzymatic O
synthesis O
of O
chondroitin B-Chemical
pentasaccharide I-Chemical
in O
vitro. O
In O
one O
tube O
reaction O
with O
four O
enzymes, O
beta B-Gene
1,4-galactosyltransferase-VII, I-Gene
beta O
1,3-galactosyltransferase-VI, O
glucuronyltransferase-I, O
and O
this O
enzyme, O
and O
a O
synthetic O
xylose-peptide O
acceptor, O
the O
structure O
GalNAc-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-peptide B-Chemical
was O
constructed. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
report O
of O
a O
chondroitin B-Chemical
pentasaccharide I-Chemical
constructed O
with O
recombinant O
glycosyltransferases O
in O
