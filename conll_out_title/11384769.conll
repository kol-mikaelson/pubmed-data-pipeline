# Abstract
Apelin B-Gene
is O
an O
endogenous O
ligand O
of O
the O
human B-Species
orphan O
receptor O
APJ. B-Gene
We O
detected O
apelin-like O
immunoreactivity O
in O
the O
adipocytes, O
gastric O
mucosa, O
and O
Kupffer O
cells O
in O
the O
liver. O
We O
also O
detected O
apelin-like O
immunoreactivity O
localized O
within O
the O
endothelia O
of O
small O
arteries O
in O
various O
organs. O
Further, O
it O
was O
found O
that O
mean O
arterial O
pressure O
after O
the O
administration O
of O
apelin-12, O
apelin-13, O
and O
apelin-36 O
at O
a O
dose O
of O
10 O
nmol O
kg O
in O
anaesthetized O
rats B-Species
was O
reduced O
by O
26+ O
-5, O
11+ O
-4, O
and O
5+ O
-4 O
mm O
Hg, O
respectively. O
In O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
nitric B-Chemical
oxide I-Chemical
(NO) O
synthase O
inhibitor, O
the O
effect O
of O
apelin-12 O
on O
blood O
pressure O
was O
abolished. O
Furthermore, O
the O
administration O
of O
apelin-12 O
(10 O
nmol O
kg) O
in O
rats B-Species
produced O
a O
transitory O
elevation O
of O
the O
plasma O
nitrite B-Chemical
nitrate B-Chemical
concentration O
from O
a O
basal O
level O
of O
21.4+ O
-1.6 O
to O
27.0+ O
-1.5 O
microM. O
Thus, O
apelin B-Gene
may O
lower O
blood O
pressure O
via O
a O
nitric O
oxide-dependent O
mechanism. O
