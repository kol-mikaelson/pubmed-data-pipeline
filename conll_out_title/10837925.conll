# Abstract
Canavan B-Disease
disease I-Disease
is O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
aspartoacylase, B-Gene
the O
enzyme O
that O
degrades O
N-acetylaspartate B-Chemical
(NAA) B-Chemical
into O
acetate B-Chemical
and O
aspartate. B-Chemical
Murine B-Species
aspartoacylase B-Gene
(mASPA) O
was O
cloned O
using O
sequence O
information O
from O
mouse B-Species
expressed O
sequence O
tags O
homologous O
to O
the O
human B-Species
cDNA. O
The O
open O
reading O
frame O
was O
cloned O
into O
a O
thioredoxin B-Gene
fusion O
vector, O
overexpressed O
in O
bacteria, O
and O
the O
protein O
was O
purified O
using O
affinity O
chromatography O
to O
near O
homogeneity. O
Recombinant O
human B-Species
ASPA B-Gene
(hASPA) O
was O
prepared O
by O
a O
similar O
method. O
Both O
recombinant O
enzymes O
were O
highly O
specific O
to O
NAA, B-Chemical
with O
about O
10% O
of O
the O
NAA B-Chemical
activity O
toward O
N-acetylasparagine. B-Chemical
More O
interestingly, O
the O
product O
of O
N-acetylasparagine B-Chemical
was O
aspartate B-Chemical
but O
not O
asparagine, B-Chemical
indicating O
that O
ASPA B-Gene
catalyzed O
deacetylation O
as O
well O
as O
hydrolysis O
of O
the O
beta B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
amide. I-Chemical
Our O
success O
in O
preparing O
the O
recombinant O
ASPA B-Gene
in O
high O
purity O
should O
permit O
multiple O
lines O
of O
investigations O
to O
understand O
the O
pathogenic O
mechanisms O
of O
Canavan B-Disease
disease I-Disease
and O
the O
functional O
roles O
of O
NAA. B-Chemical
