# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Thiamine B-Chemical
diphosphate I-Chemical
(ThDP) B-Chemical
is O
the O
active O
form O
of O
thiamine, B-Chemical
and O
it O
serves O
as O
a O
cofactor O
for O
several O
enzymes, O
both O
cytosolic O
and O
mitochondrial. O
Isolated O
mitochondria O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
take O
up O
thiamine B-Chemical
yet O
thiamine B-Chemical
diphosphokinase I-Gene
is O
cytosolic O
and O
not O
present O
in O
mitochondria. O
Previous O
reports O
indicate O
that O
ThDP B-Chemical
can O
also O
be O
taken O
up O
by O
rat B-Species
mitochondria, O
but O
the O
kinetic O
constants O
associated O
with O
such O
uptake O
seemed O
not O
to O
be O
physiologically O
relevant. O
RESULTS: O
Here O
we O
examine O
ThDP B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
mitochondria O
from O
several O
human B-Species
cell O
types, O
including O
cells O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
thiamine-responsive O
megaloblastic B-Disease
anemia I-Disease
(TRMA) B-Disease
that O
lack O
a O
functional O
thiamine B-Chemical
transporter O
of O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
Although O
mitochondria O
from O
normal O
lymphoblasts O
took O
up O
thiamine B-Chemical
in O
the O
low O
micromolar O
range, O
surprisingly O
mitochondria O
from O
TRMA B-Disease
lymphoblasts O
lacked O
this O
uptake O
component. O
ThDP B-Chemical
was O
taken O
up O
efficiently O
by O
mitochondria O
isolated O
from O
either O
normal O
or O
TRMA B-Disease
lymphoblasts. O
Uptake O
was O
saturable O
and O
biphasic O
with O
a O
high O
affinity O
component O
characterized O
by O
a O
Km O
of O
0.4 O
to O
0.6 O
microM. O
Mitochondria O
from O
other O
cell O
types O
possessed O
a O
similar O
high O
affinity O
uptake O
component O
with O
variation O
seen O
in O
uptake O
capacity O
as O
revealed O
by O
differences O
in O
Vmax O
values. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
results O
suggest O
a O
shared O
thiamine B-Chemical
transporter O
for O
mitochondria O
and O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
Additionally, O
a O
high O
affinity O
component O
of O
ThDP B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
mitochondria O
was O
identified O
with O
the O
apparent O
affinity O
constant O
less O
than O
the O
estimates O
of O
the O
cytosolic O
concentration O
of O
free O
ThDP. B-Chemical
This O
finding O
indicates O
that O
the O
high O
affinity O
uptake O
is O
physiologically O
significant O
and O
may O
represent O
the O
main O
mechanism O
for O
supplying O
phosphorylated O
thiamine B-Chemical
for O
mitochondrial O
enzymes. O
