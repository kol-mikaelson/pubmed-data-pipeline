# Abstract
Nephrotoxicity B-Disease
is O
the O
dose-limiting O
clinical O
adverse O
effect O
of O
cidofovir B-Chemical
and O
adefovir, B-Chemical
two O
potent O
antiviral O

Because O

plays O
a O
role O
in O
the O
etiology O
of O
cidofovir- B-Chemical
and O
adefovir-associated O
nephrotoxicity, B-Disease
we O
attempted O
to O
identify O
a O

of O
interacting O
with O
these O
therapeutics. O
A O

Northern O

However, O
reverse O

revealed O
hOAT1 B-Gene

human B-Species
brain O
and O
skeletal O

Immunoblot O

that O

is O
an O

Xenopus B-Species

The O

These O

the O
