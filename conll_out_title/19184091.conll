# Abstract
Near O
complete O
reabsorption O
of O
filtered O
amino O
acids O
is O
a O
main O
specialized O
transport O
function O
of O
the O
kidney O
proximal O
tubule. O
This O
evolutionary O
conserved O
task O
is O
carried O
out O
by O
a O
subset O
of O
luminal O
and O
basolateral O
transporters O
that O
together O
form O
the O
transcellular O
amino O
acid O
transport O
machinery O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
small O
intestine. O
A O
number O
of O
other O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
expressed O
in O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
of O
proximal O
kidney O
tubule O
cells O
subserve O
either O
specialized O
metabolic O
functions, O
such O
as O
the O
production O
of O
ammonium, B-Chemical
or O
are O
part O
of O
the O
cellular O
housekeeping O
equipment. O
A O
new O
finding O
is O
that O
the O
luminal O
Na(+)-dependent O
neutral O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
of O
the O
SLC6 O
family O
require O
an O
associated O
protein O
for O
their O
surface O
expression O
as O
shown O
for O
the O
Hartnup B-Disease
transporter O
B(0)AT1 B-Gene
(SLC6A19) B-Gene
and O
suggested O
for O
the O
L: O
-proline O
transporter O
SIT1 B-Gene
(IMINO(B), O
SLC6A20) B-Gene
and O
for O
B(0)AT3 O
(XT2, B-Gene
SLC6A18). B-Gene
This O
accessory O
subunit O
called O
collectrin B-Gene
(TMEM27) B-Gene
is O
homologous O
to O
the O
transmembrane O
anchor O
region O
of O
the O
renin-angiotensin O
system O
enzyme O
ACE2 B-Gene
that O
we O
have O
shown O
to O
function O
in O
small O
intestine O
as O
associated O
subunit O
of O
the O
luminal O
SLC6 O
transporters O
B(0)AT1 B-Gene
and O
SIT1. B-Gene
Some O
mutations O
of O
B(0)AT1 B-Gene
differentially O
interact O
with O
these O
accessory O
subunits, O
providing O
an O
explanation O
for O
differential O
intestinal O
phenotypes O
among O
Hartnup B-Disease
patients. O
The O
basolateral O
efflux O
of O
numerous O
amino O
acids O
from O
kidney O
tubular O
cells O
is O
mediated O
by O
heteromeric O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
that O
function O
as O
obligatory O
exchangers. O
Thus, O
other O
transporters O
within O
the O
same O
membrane O
need O
to O
mediate O
the O
net O
efflux O
of O
exchange O
substrates, O
controlling O
thereby O
the O
net O
basolateral O
amino O
transport O
and O
thus O
the O
intracellular O
amino O
acid O
concentration. O
