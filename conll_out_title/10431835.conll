# Abstract
N-Acetylneuraminic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
a O
main O
constituent O
of O
glycoproteins O
and O
gangliosides. B-Chemical
In O
many O
membrane-bound O
receptors O
it O
is O
the O
target O
for O
external O
stimuli. O
The O
key O
enzyme O
for O
its O
biosynthesis O
is O
the O
bifunctional O
enzyme O
UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine-2-epimerase O
N-acetylmannosamine O
kinase, O
catalysing O
the O
first O

The O
rat B-Species
enzyme O
was O
previously O
isolated O
and O
characterised. O
