# Abstract
In O
order O
to O
determine O
the O
effects O
of O
taurine B-Chemical
supplementation O
or O
depletion O
on O
the O
morphological O
changes O
of O
pancreatic O
beta-cells O
in O
streptozotocin-induced O
diabetic B-Disease
rats, B-Species
Sprague-Dawley O
male O
rats B-Species
were O
fed O
the O
purified O
diets O
supplemented O
with O
1, O
2 O
or O
3% O
taurine B-Chemical
or O
5% O
beta-alanine B-Chemical
in O
their O
drinking O
water O
for O
7 O
weeks. O
After O
3 O
weeks, O
diabetes B-Disease
was O
induced O
by O
streptozotocin B-Chemical
injection O
(50 O
mg O
kg O
body-weight). O
Pancreatic O
morphology O
was O
observed O
by O
transmission O
electron O
microscopy. O
The O
pancreatic O
beta-cell O
of O
the O
non-diabetic O
(CO) O
group O
had O
the O
many O
secretory O
granules, O
rough O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
and O
rod O
shaped O
mitochondria. O
However, O
the O
beta-cells O
of O
non O
taurine-supplemented O
diabetic B-Disease
(EO) O
group O
were O
severely O
damaged, O
showing O
depleted O
secretory O
granules. O
In O
the O
1% O
taurine-supplemented O
diabetic B-Disease
group, O
the O
beta-cells O
were O
less O
damaged O
compared O
to O
the O
EO O
group O
and O
had O
some O
apparently O
normal O
secretory O
granules, O
but O
most O
of O
rough O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
and O
mitochondria O
was O
destroyed. O
The O
beta-cell O
of O
2% O
taurine-supplemented O
diabetic B-Disease
group O
had O
swollen O
rough O
endoplasmic O
reticulum, O
round-shaped O
mitochondria O
and O
some O
apparently O
normal O
secretory O
granules. O
The O
beta-cell O
of O
3% O
taurine-supplemented O
diabetic B-Disease
group O
was O
little O
different O
from O
that O
of O
non-diabetic O
group. O
The O
pancreatic O
beta-cell O
of O
taurine-depleted O
diabetic B-Disease
group O
was O
not O
destroyed O
but O
had O
many O
small O
secretory O
granules O
which O
appeared O
immature. O
This O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
blood B-Chemical
glucose I-Chemical
concentrations O
of O
this O
group. O
Therefore, O
taurine B-Chemical
may O
prevent O
insulin-dependent B-Disease
diabetes B-Disease
by O
protection O
of O
the O
pancreatic O
beta-cell O
and O
may O
also O
preserve O
normal O
secretory O
granules. O
From O
these O
results, O
taurine B-Chemical
supplementation O
may O
be O
recommended O
for O
prevention O
and O
treatment O
of O
diabetes. B-Disease
