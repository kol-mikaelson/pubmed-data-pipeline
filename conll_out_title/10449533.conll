Role O

peroxisomes O
in O
isoprenoid B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O

# Abstract
Our O
group O
and O
others O
have O
recently O
demonstrated O
that O
peroxisomes O
contain O
a O
number O
of O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
that O
previously O
were O
considered O
to O
be O
cytosolic O
or O
located O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
(ER). O
Peroxisomes O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
contain O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase, I-Gene
mevalonate B-Chemical
kinase, I-Gene
phosphomevalonate B-Gene
kinase, I-Gene
phosphomevalonate O
decarboxylase, O
isopentenyl O
diphosphate O
isomerase, O
and O
FPP B-Gene
synthase. I-Gene
Four O
of O
the O
five O
enzymes O
required O
for O
the O
conversion O
of O
mevalonate B-Chemical
to O
FPP O
contain O
a O
conserved O
putative O
PTS1 O
or O
PTS2, O
supporting O
the O
concept O
of O
targeted O
transport O
into O
peroxisomes. O
To O
date, O
no O
information O
is O
available O
regarding O
the O
function O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
isoprenoid B-Chemical
metabolism, O
and O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
has O
yet O
to O
be O
determined. O
We O
have O
identified O
a O
mammalian O
cell O
line O
that O
expresses O
only O
one O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
protein, O
and O
which O
is O
localized O
exclusively O
to O
peroxisomes, O
to O
facilitate O
our O
studies O
on O
the O
function, O
regulation, O
and O
structure O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase. I-Gene
This O
cell O
line O
was O
obtained O
by O
growing O
UT2 B-CellLine
cells O
(which O
lack O
the O
ER O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase) I-Gene
in O
the O
absence O
of O
mevalonate. B-Chemical
The O
surviving O
cells O
exhibited O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
a O
90-kD O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
that O
was O
localized O
exclusively O
to O
peroxisomes. O
The O
wild-type O
CHO B-CellLine
cells O
contain O
two O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
proteins, O
the O
well-characterized O
97-kD O
protein O
localized O
in O
the O
ER, O
and O
a O
90-kD O
protein O
localized O
in O
peroxisomes. O
We O
have O
also O
identified O
the O
mutations O
in O
the O
UT2 B-CellLine
cells O
responsible O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
the O
97-kD O
protein. O
In O
addition, O
peroxisomal-deficient O
Pex2 B-Gene
CHO B-CellLine
cell O
mutants O
display O
reduced O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
levels O
and O
have O
reduced O
rates O
of O
sterol O
and O
nonsterol O
biosynthesis. O
These O
data O
further O
support O
the O
proposal O
that O
peroxisomes O
play O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
isoprenoid B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
