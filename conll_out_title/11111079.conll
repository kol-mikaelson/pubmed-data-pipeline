# Abstract
At O
least O
three O
different O
subcellular O
compartments, O
including O
peroxisomes, O
are O
involved O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
synthesis. O
Recently, O
it O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
peroxisomes O
contain O
a O
number O
of O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biogenesis O
that O
previously O
were O
considered O
to O
be O
cytosolic O
or O
located O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum. O
Peroxisomes O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
contain O
acetoacetyl-CoA B-Gene
thiolase, I-Gene
HMG-CoA B-Gene
synthase, I-Gene
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase, I-Gene
mevalonate B-Gene
kinase, I-Gene
phosphomevalonate B-Gene
kinase, I-Gene
phosphomevalonate O
decarboxylase, O
isopentenyl O
diphosphate O
isomerase O
and O
FPP B-Gene
synthase. I-Gene
Moreover, O
the O
activities O
of O
these O
enzymes O
are O
also O
significantly O
decreased O
in O
liver O
tissue O
and O
fibroblast O
cells O
obtained O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
peroxisomal B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
In O
addition, O
the O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthetic O
capacity O
is O
severely O
impaired O
in O
cultured O
skin O
fibroblasts O
obtained O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
peroxisomal B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
These O
findings O
support O
the O
proposal O
that O
peroxisomes O
play O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
isoprenoid O
biosynthesis. O
This O
paper O
presents O
a O
review O
of O
peroxisomal O
protein O
targeting O
and O
of O
recent O
studies O
demonstrating O
the O
localization O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthetic O
enzymes O
in O
peroxisomes O
and O
the O
identification O
of O
peroxisomal O
targeting O
signals O
in O
these O
proteins. O
