# Abstract
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
(GPI) B-Chemical
anchors O
are O
attached O
to O
newly O
synthesized O
proteins O
in O
the O
ER O
by O
a O
transamidation O
reaction O
during O
which O
a O
C-terminal O
GPI B-Chemical
attachment O
signal O
is O
replaced O
by O
a O
preformed O
GPI B-Chemical
precursor O
lipid. O
This O
reaction O
depends O
on O
GAA1 B-Gene
and O
GPI8, B-Gene
the O
latter O
belonging O
to O
a O
novel O
cysteine O
protease O
family. O
Homologies O
between O
this O
family O
and O
other O
Cys O
proteinases, O
such O
as O
caspases, O
pointed O
to O
Cys199 O
and O
His157 O
as O
potential O
active O
site O
residues. O
Indeed, O
gpi8 B-Gene
alleles O
mutated O
at O
Cys199 O
or O
His157 O
are O
nonfunctional, O
i.e., O
they O
are O
unable O
to O
suppress O
the O
lethality O
of O
Deltagpi8 O
mutants. O
The O
overexpression O
of O
these O
nonfunctional O
alleles O
in O
wild-type O
cells O
leads O
to O
the O
accumulation O
of O
the O

CP2, B-Gene

the O

of O

The O
dominant O
negative O

of O
the O

cannot O
be O
overcome O
by O
the O
simultaneous O

also O

observed O
when O
Gpi8p B-Gene
is O
depleted O
to O
50% O
of O
its O
normal O
level O
in O
wild-type O
cells. O
The O
dominant O
negative O
effect O
of O
nonfunctional O
and O
partially O
functional O
mutant O
alleles O
can O
best O
be O
explained O
by O
assuming O
that O
Gpi8p B-Gene
works O
as O
part O
of O
a O
homo- O
or O
heteropolymeric O
complex. O
