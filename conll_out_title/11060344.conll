# Abstract
2-Methylacyl-CoA B-Gene
racemase I-Gene
is O
an O
auxiliary O
enzyme O
required O
for O
the O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidative O
breakdown O
of B-Gene
(2R)-pristanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
the O
(25R)-isomer B-Chemical
of B-Gene
C(27) B-Chemical
bile I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
intermediates. O
The O
enzyme O
activity O
is O
found O
not O
only O
in O
peroxisomes O
but O
also O
is O
present O
in O
mitochondria O
of B-Gene
human B-Species

and O
fibroblasts. O
The O

Hitherto O
this O
sequence O
has O
not O
been O
recognized O
as O
a O
peroxisomal O
targeting O

(PTS1). O
From O

we O

that O

To O

As O

is O
localized O
between O
amino O

22 O
and O
85.Hence, O
our O
data O
show O
that O
a O
single O
transcript O
gives O
rise O
to O
a O
racemase O
protein O
containing O
two O
topogenic O
signals, O
explaining O
the O
dual O

localization O
of B-Gene
the O
activity. O
