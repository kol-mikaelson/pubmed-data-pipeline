Cells O

up O
long B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
free I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(FFA) B-Chemical
in O
vivo O
from O
the O
non-protein O
bound O
ligand O
pools O
in O
extracellular O
fluid O
and O
plasma, O
which O
contain O
approximately O
100 O
and O
600 O
microM O
albumin, B-Gene
respectively. O
The O
physiologic O
range O
of O
unbound O
FFA B-Chemical
concentrations O
in O
such O
fluids O
has O
traditionally O
been O
calculated O
at O
<1 O
microM. O
Studies O
of O
[3H]-oleate B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
hepatocytes, O
adipocytes, O
cardiac O
myocytes O
and O
other O
cell O
types O
demonstrate O
that O
FFA B-Chemical
uptake O
within O
this O
range O
is O
saturable, O
and O
exhibits O
many O
other O
kinetic O
properties O
indicative O
of O
facilitated O
transport. O
Within O
this O
range, O
the O
uptake O

of O
the O
acidic O
(pKa O

FFA B-Chemical
analog O
alpha2,beta2,omega3-heptafluorostearate B-Chemical
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O

Thus, O
uptake O
of O
physiologic O
concentrations O
of O
FFA B-Chemical
involves O
facilitated O
transport O
of O
the O
FFA B-Chemical
anion I-Chemical
(FA). O
Over O
a O
much O
wider O
range O
of O
unbound O
FFA B-Chemical
concentrations O
hepatocellular O
[3H]-oleate B-Chemical
uptake O
exhibits O
both O
saturable O
and O
non-saturable O
components. O
Oleate B-Chemical
binding O
to O
liver O
plasma O
membranes O
(LPM) O
also O
demonstrates O
such O
components. O
Comparing O
the O
two O
components O
of O
FFA B-Chemical
uptake O
to O
the O
corresponding O
components O
of O
binding O
permits O
estimates O
of O
trans-membrane O
transport O
rates. O
T1 O
2 O
for O
saturable O
uptake O
(approximately O
1 O
sec) O
is O
less O
than O
for O
non-saturable O
uptake O
(approximately O
14 O
sec). O
Others O
have O
determined O
the O
flip-flop O
rates O
of O
protonated O
FFA B-Chemical
(FAH) B-Gene
across O
small O
and O
large O
unilamellar O
vesicles O
(SUV, O
LUV) O
and O
across O
cellular O
plasma O
membranes. O
These O
reported O
flip-flop O
rates, O
measured O
by O
the O
decrease O
in O
pH O
resulting O
from O
the O
accompanying O
proton O
flux, O
exhibit O
a O
highly O
significant O
inverse O
correlation O
with O
cell O
and O
vesicle O
diameter O
(r O
= O
0.99). O
Although O
T1 O
2's O
in O
vesicles O
are O
in O
the O
msec O
range, O
those O
in O
cells O
are O
>10 O
sec, O
and O
thus O
comparable O
to O
the O
rates O
of O
non-saturable O
uptake O
we O
determined. O
Thus, O
under O
physiologic O
conditions, O
the O
predominant O
mechanism O
of O
cellular O
FFA B-Chemical
uptake O
is O
facilitated O
transport O
of O
FA O
; O
at O
much O
higher, O
non-physiologic O
FFA B-Chemical
concentrations, O
passive O
flip-flop O
of O
FAH B-Gene
predominates. O
Several O
plasma O
membrane O
proteins O
have O
been O
identified O
as O
potential O
mediators O
of O
facilitated O
FFA B-Chemical
transport. O
Studies O
in O
animal O
models O
of O
obesity O
and O
non-insulin O
dependent O
diabetes O
mellitus O
demonstrate O
that O
tissue-specific O
regulation O
of O
facilitated O
FFA B-Chemical
transport O
has O
important O
pathophysiologic O
consequences. O
