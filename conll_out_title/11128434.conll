# Abstract
Intoxications O
with O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol, I-Chemical
methanol, B-Chemical
and O
isopropanol B-Chemical
are O
among O
the O
most O
common O
ingestions, O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
which O
a O
nephrologist O
plays O
an O
important O
role. O
These O
three O
substances O
have O
the O
ideal O
characteristics O
for O
intervention O
by O
hemodialysis, O
and O
the O
three O
parent O
compounds O
and O
their O
metabolites O
are O
readily O
dialyzable. O
Two O
of O
the O
three O
substances, O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol I-Chemical
and O
methanol, B-Chemical
are O
metabolized O
to O
more O
toxic O
substances, O
so O
that O
an O
early O
treatment O
strategy O
that O
removes O
the O
parent O
compound O
or O
blocks O
its O
metabolism O
can O
prevent O
the O
development O
of O
many O
of O
the O
adverse O
events O
that O
are O
often O
seen O
in O
these O
ingestions. O
Fomepizole, B-Chemical
an O
inhibitor O
of O
alcohol B-Gene
dehydrogenase, I-Gene
slows O
the O
metabolism O
of O
these O
substances O
and O
is O
now O
approved O
by O
the O
US O
Food O
and O
Drug O
Administration O
for O
use O
in O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol I-Chemical
intoxication. O
The O
present O
review O
addresses O
recent O
advances O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
of O
intoxication O
with O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol, I-Chemical

and O
