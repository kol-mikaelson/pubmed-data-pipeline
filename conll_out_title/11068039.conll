# Abstract
Na(+)-dependent, O
high-affinity O
choline B-Chemical
uptake O
in O
cholinergic O
neurons O
is O
the O
rate-limiting O
step O
in O
acetylcholine B-Chemical
synthesis. O
Here O
we O
report O
the O
molecular O
cloning O
and O
functional O
characterization O
of O
the O
human B-Species
high-affinity O
choline B-Chemical
transporter O
(hCHT1). O
The O
hCHT1 O
exhibits O
significant O
homology O
with O
known O
members O
of O
the O
Na(+)-dependent O
glucose O
transporter O
family, O
but O
not O
with O
members O
of O
the O
neurotransmitter O
transporter O
family. O
The O
human B-Species
CHT1 B-Gene
gene O
is O
25 O
kb O
in O
length O
with O
9 O
exons O
and O
was O
assigned O
to O
chromosome O
II O
at O

IIq11-12. O
Northern O

showed O
that O
a O
5.4 O
kb O
hCHT1 O
transcript O
was O
expressed O
exclusively O
in O
tissues O
containing O
cholinergic O
neurons. O
When O
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
oocytes, O
the O
human B-Species
clone O
induced O
Na(+)- O
and O
Cl(-)-dependent, O
high-affinity O
choline B-Chemical
uptake, O
which O
was O
sensitive O
to O
the O

The O
hCHT1-mediated O
choline B-Chemical
