# Abstract
Cellular O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
typically O
derive O
from O
uptake O
from O
the O
extracellular O
milieu O
and, O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent, O
de O
novo O
synthesis. O
Extracellular O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
must O
traverse O
the O
plasma O
membrane, O
after O
which O
they O
are O
activated O
to O
their O
CoA B-Chemical
thioesters I-Chemical
for O
subsequent O
metabolism. O
Both O
uptake O
and O
metabolism O
are O
rapid O
processes, O
and O
there O
has O
been O
considerable O
debate O
as O
to O
whether O
transport O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
across O
the O
lipid B-Chemical
bilayer O
of O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
proceeds O
by O
diffusion O
or O
requires O
transport O
proteins. O
One O
group O
of O
proteins O
proposed O
to O
translocate O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
is O
the O
six-member O
Fatty O
Acid O
Transport O
Protein O
(FATP) O
family. O
These O
proteins O
were O
designated O
as O
such O
because O
when O
overexpressed, O
host O
cells O
exhibited O
higher O
rates O
of O
accretion O
of O
radioactive O
or O
fluorescent O
fatty B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
However, O
one O
member O
of O
this O
family, O
FATP2, B-Gene
is O
identical O
to O
an O
enzyme O
with O
very O
long-chain O
acyl-CoA O
synthetase O
(ACSVL) O
activity. O
This O
enzyme O
(ACSVL1 B-Gene
or O
FATP2), B-Gene
was O
isolated O
using O
classical O
protein O
purification O
techniques. O
In O
fact, O
the O
six-member O
ACSVL O
protein O
family O
is O
identical O
to O
the O
six-member O
FATP O
family. O
We O
and O
others O
have O
established O
that O
all O
six O
proteins O
have O
acyl-CoA O
synthetase O
activity. O
It O
remains O
to O
be O
established O
whether O
they O
participate O
in O
the O
physical O
translocation O
process, O
or O
facilitate O
transport O
by O
trapping, O
as O
CoA B-Chemical
derivatives, O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
that O
enter O
cells O
by O
diffusion. O
To O
characterize O
the O
biological O
functions O
of O
the O
ACSVLs, O
we O
are O
investigating O
the O
properties O
of O
the O
overexpressed O
proteins O
and O
the O
endogenous O
proteins. O
We O
observed O
that O
for O
many O
ACSVLs, O
the O
subcellular O
location O
of O
the O
overexpressed O
protein O
differs O
from O
that O
of O
the O
endogenous O
protein. O
Using O
RNA O
interference O
(siRNA), O
we O
knocked O
down O
expression O
of O
FATP4 B-Gene
(proposed O
name: O
ACSVL5) O
in O
Neuro2a B-CellLine
cells. O
Activation O
of O
both O
long-chain O
(C16:0) B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
very I-Chemical
long-chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(C24:0) B-Chemical
was O
decreased O
when O
FATP4 B-Gene
was O
depleted. O
Despite O
decreased O
enzyme O
activity, O
initial O
rates O
of O
uptake O
of O
[14C]C16:0 B-Chemical
were O
not O
affected O
when O
FATP4 B-Gene
was O
depleted. O
In O
contrast, O
COS-1 B-CellLine
cells O
overexpressing O
FATP4 B-Gene
showed O
enhanced O
[14C]C16:0 B-Chemical
uptake. O
Neither O
endogenous O
(Neuro2a) B-CellLine
nor O
overexpressed O
(COS-1) B-CellLine
FATP4 B-Gene
was O
localized O
to O
plasma O
membrane O
under O
routine O
cell O
culture O
conditions, O
but O
rather O
were O
found O
in O
intracellular O
membrane O
compartments. O
We O
conclude O
that, O
in O
the O
cell O
lines O
studied, O
endogenous O
FATP4 B-Gene
does O
not O
function O
to O
translocate O
FA O
across O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
