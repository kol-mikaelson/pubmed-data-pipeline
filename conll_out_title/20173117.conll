# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Molecular O
tools O
may O
provide O
insight O
into O
cardiovascular O
risk. O
We O
assessed O
whether O
metabolites O
discriminate O
coronary B-Disease
artery I-Disease
disease I-Disease
(CAD) B-Disease
and O
predict O
risk O
of O
cardiovascular O
events. O
METHODS O
AND O
RESULTS: O
We O
performed O
mass-spectrometry-based O
profiling O
of O
69 O
metabolites O
in O
subjects O
from O
the O
CATHGEN O
biorepository. O
To O
evaluate O
discriminative O
capabilities O
of O
metabolites O
for O
CAD, B-Disease
2 O
groups O
were O
profiled: O
174 O
CAD B-Disease

and O
174 O
sex O
race-matched O
controls O
("initial"), O
and O
140 O
CAD B-Disease
cases O
and O
140 O
controls O
("replication"). O
To O
evaluate O
the O
capability O
of O
metabolites O
to O
predict O
cardiovascular O
events, O
cases O
were O
combined O
("event" O
group); O
of O
these, O
74 O
experienced O
death B-Disease
myocardial B-Disease
infarction I-Disease
during O
follow-up. O
A O
third O
independent O
group O
was O
profiled O
("event-replication" O
group; O
n=63 O
cases O
with O
cardiovascular O
events, O
66 O

Analysis O
included O
principal-components O

linear O
regression, O
and O
Cox O
proportional O
hazards. O
Two O
principal O
