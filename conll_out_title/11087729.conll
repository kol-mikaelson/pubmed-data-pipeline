# Abstract
Human B-Species
UDP-d-xylose:proteoglycan O
core O
protein O
beta-d-xylosyltransferase O
(EC, O
XT) B-Chemical
initiates O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
glycosaminoglycan B-Chemical
lateral O
chains O
in O
proteoglycans O
by O
transfer O
of O
xylose B-Chemical
from O
UDP-xylose B-Chemical
to O
specific O
serine B-Chemical
residues O
of O
the O
core O
protein. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
report O
the O
first O
isolation O
of O
the O
XT B-Chemical
and O
present O
the O
first O
partial O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
of O
this O
enzyme. O
We O
purified O
XT B-Chemical
4,700-fold O
with O
1% O
yield O
from O
serum-free O
JAR B-CellLine
choriocarcinoma B-Disease
cell O
culture O
supernatant. O
The O
isolation O
procedure O
included O
a O
combination O
of O
ammonium B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
precipitation, O
heparin B-Chemical
affinity O
chromatography, O
ion O
exchange O
chromatography, O
and O
protamine O
affinity O
chromatography. O
Among O
other O
proteins O
an O
unknown O
protein O
was O
detected O
by O
matrix-assisted O
laser O
desorption O
ionization O
mass O
spectrometry-time O
of O
flight O
analysis O
in O
the O
purified O
sample. O
The O
molecular O
mass O
of O
this O
protein O
was O
determined O
as O
120 O
kDa O
by O
SDS-polyacrylamide O
gel O
electrophoresis. O
The O
isolated O
protein O
was O
enzymatically O
cleaved O
by O
trypsin O
and O
endoproteinase O
Lys-C. O
Eleven O
peptide O
fragments O
were O
sequenced O
by O
Edman O
degradation. O
Searches O
with O
the O
amino O
acid O
sequences O
in O
protein O
and O
EST O
data O
bases O
showed O
no O
homology O
to O
known O
sequences. O
XT B-Chemical
was O
enriched O
by O
immunoaffinity O
chromatography O
with O
an O
immobilized O
antibody O
against O
a O
synthetic O
peptide O
deduced O
from O
the O
sequenced O
peptide O
fragments O
and O
was O
specifically O
eluted O
with O
the O
antigen. O
In O
addition, O
XT B-Chemical
was O
purified O
alternatively O
with O
an O
aprotinin O
affinity O
chromatography O
and O
was O
detected O
by O
Western O
blot O

in O
the O
enzyme-containing O
fraction. O
