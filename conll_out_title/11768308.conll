# Abstract
Biochemical O
experiments O
over O
the O
past O
40 O
years O
have O
shown O
that O
nucleoside B-Chemical
diphosphate I-Chemical
(NDP) B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
activity, O
which O
catalyzes O
phosphoryl O
transfer O
from O
a O
nucleoside B-Chemical
triphosphate I-Chemical
to O
a O
nucleoside B-Chemical
diphosphate, I-Chemical
is O
ubiquitously O
found O
in O
organisms O
from O
bacteria O
to O
human. B-Species
Over O
the O
past O
10 O
years, O
eight O
human B-Species
genes O
of O
the O
nm23 B-Gene
NDP B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
family O
have O
been O
discovered O
that O
can O
be O
separated O
into O
two O
groups O
based O
on O
analysis O
of O
their O
sequences. O
In O
addition O
to O
catalysis, O
which O
may O
not O
be O
exhibited O
by O
all O
isoforms, O
evidence O
for O
regulatory O
roles O
has O
come O
recently O
from O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
genes O
nm23 B-Gene
and O
awd, B-Gene
which O
encode O
NDP O
kinases O
and O
are O
involved O
in O
tumor B-Disease
metastasis I-Disease
and O
Drosophila B-Species
development, O
respectively. O
Current O
work O
shows O
that O
the O
human B-Species
NDP B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
genes O
are O
differentially O
expressed O
in O
tissues O
and O
that O
their O
products O
are O
targeted O
to O
different O
subcellular O
locations. O
This O
suggests O
that O
Nm23 B-Gene
NDP O
kinases O
possess O
different, O
but O
specific, O
functions O
within O
the O
cell, O
depending O
on O
their O
localization. O
The O
roles O
of O
NDP O
kinases O
in O
metabolic O
pathways O
and O
nucleic O
acid O
synthesis O
are O
discussed. O
