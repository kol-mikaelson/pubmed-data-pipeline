# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Cystic B-Disease
fibrosis I-Disease
(CF) B-Disease
is O
a O
syndrome O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
cystic B-Gene
fibrosis I-Gene
transmembrane I-Gene
regulator I-Gene
(CFTR) B-Gene
gene. O
Despite O
advances O
in O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
molecular O
pathogenesis O
of O
CF, B-Disease
the O
link O
between O
CFTR B-Gene
gene O
mutations O
and O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
CF B-Disease
lung I-Disease
disease I-Disease
remains O
poorly O
defined. O
CFTR B-Gene
has O
been O
assigned O
a O
number O
of O
putative O
functions O
that O
may O
contribute O
to O
innate O
airway O
defense, O
including O
the O
regulation O
of O
adenosine B-Chemical
5'-triphosphate I-Chemical
(ATP) B-Chemical
release O
into O
the O
extracellular O
environment. O
Because O
extracellular O
ATP B-Chemical
and O
uridine B-Chemical
5'-triphosphate I-Chemical
(UTP) B-Chemical
may O
regulate O
airway O
mucociliary O
clearance O
via O
interaction O
with O
luminal O
P2Y2 O
receptors, O
the O
loss O
of O
CFTR-mediated O
nucleotide O
release O
could O
explain O
the O
defect O
in O
CF B-Disease
airway O
defense. O
MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
We O
tested O
the O
physiologic O
importance O
of O
CFTR-mediated O
nucleotide O
release O
in O
vivo O
by O
directly O
measuring O
levels O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
and O
UTP B-Chemical
in O
nasal O
airway O
surface O
liquid O
from O
normal O
and O
CF B-Disease
subjects. O
Because O
these O
basal O
nucleotide O
levels O
reflect O
the O
net O
activities O
of O
nucleotide O
release O
and O
metabolic O
pathways, O
we O
also O
measured O
constitutive O
rates O
of O
nucleotide O
release O
and O
metabolism O
on O
well-differentiated O
normal O
and O
CF B-Disease
airway O
cultures O
in O
vitro. O
The O
measurement O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
release O
rates O
were O
paralleled O
by O
in O
vivo O
studies O
employing O
continuous O
nasal O
perfusion O
in O
normal O
and O
CF B-Disease
subjects. O
Finally, O
the O
regulation O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
release O
by O
isoproterenol B-Chemical
and O
methacholine-stimulated O
submucosal O
gland O
secretion O
was O
tested. O
RESULTS: O
These O
studies O
revealed O
that O
steady-state O
ATP B-Chemical
and O
UTP B-Chemical
levels O
were O
similar O
in O
normal O
(470 O
+ O
- O
131 O
nM O
and O
37 O
+ O
- O
7 O
nM, O
respectively) O
and O
CF B-Disease
(911 O
+ O
- O
199 O
nM O
and O
33 O
+ O
- O
12 O
nM, O
respectively) O
subjects. O
The O
rates O
of O
both O
ATP B-Chemical
release O
and O
metabolism O
were O
also O
similar O
in O
normal O
and O
CF B-Disease
airway O
epithelia O
both O
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo. O
Airway O
submucosal O
glands O
did O
not O
secrete O
nucleotides, O
but O
rather, O
secreted O
a O
soluble O
nucleotidase O
in O
response O
to O
cholinergic O
stimuli. O
CONCLUSION: O
The O
concentration O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
in O
airway O
surface O
liquid O
is O
in O
a O
range O
that O
is O
relevant O
for O
the O
activation O
of O
airway O
nucleotide O
receptors. O
However, O
despite O
this O
finding O
that O
suggests O
endogenous O
nucleotides O
may O
be O
important O
for O
the O
regulation O
of O
mucociliary O
clearance, O
our O
data O
do O
not O
support O
a O
role O
for O
CFTR B-Gene
in O
regulating O
extracellular O
nucleotide O
concentrations O
on O
airway O
surfaces. O
