# Abstract
The O
aldo-keto O
reductase O
(AKR) O
7 O
family O
is O
composed O
of O
the O
dimeric O
aflatoxin B-Gene
B(1) I-Gene
aldehyde I-Gene
reductase I-Gene
(AFAR) B-Gene
isoenzymes. O
In O
the O
rat, B-Species
two O
AFAR B-Gene
subunits O
exist, O
designated O
rAFAR1 B-Gene
and O
rAFAR2. B-Gene
Herein, O
we O
report O
the O
molecular O
cloning O
of O
rAFAR2, B-Gene
showing O
that O
it O
shares O
76% O
sequence O
identity O
with O
rAFAR1. B-Gene
By O
contrast O
with O
rAFAR1, B-Gene
which O
comprises O
327 O
amino O
acids, O
rAFAR2 B-Gene
contains O
367 O
amino O
acids. O
The O
40 O
extra O
residues O
in O
rAFAR2 B-Gene
are O
located O
at O
the O
N-terminus O
of O
the O
polypeptide O
as O
an O
Arg-rich O
domain O
that O
may O
form O
an O
amphipathic O
alpha-helical O
structure. O
Protein O
purification O
and O
Western O
blotting O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
two O
AFAR B-Gene
subunits O
are O
found O
in O
rat B-Species
liver O
extracts O
as O
both O
homodimers O
and O
as O
a O
heterodimer. O
Reductase O
activity O
in O
rat B-Species
liver O
towards O
2-carboxybenzaldehyde B-Chemical
(CBA) B-Chemical
was O
resolved O
by O
anion-exchange O
chromatography O
into O
three O
peaks O
containing O
rAFAR1-1, B-Gene
rAFAR1-2 B-Gene
and O
rAFAR2-2 B-Gene
dimers. O
These O
isoenzymes O
are O
functionally O
distinct; O
with O
NADPH B-Chemical
as O
cofactor, O
rAFAR1-1 B-Gene
has O
a O
low O
K(m) O
and O
high O
activity O
with O
CBA, B-Chemical
whereas O
rAFAR2-2 B-Gene
exhibits O
a O
low O
K(m) O
and O
high O
activity O
towards O
succinic B-Chemical
semialdehyde. I-Chemical
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
rAFAR1-1 B-Gene
is O
a O
detoxication O
enzyme, O
while O
rAFAR2-2 B-Gene
serves O
to O
synthesize O
the O
endogenous O
neuromodulator O
gamma-hydroxybutyrate B-Chemical
(GHB). B-Chemical
Subcellular O
fractionation O
of O
liver O
extracts O
showed O
that O
rAFAR1-1 B-Gene
was O
recovered O
in O
the O
cytosol O
whereas O
rAFAR2-2 B-Gene
was O
associated O
with O
the O
Golgi O
apparatus. O
The O
distinct O
subcellular O
localization O
of O
the O
rAFAR1 B-Gene
and O
rAFAR2 B-Gene
subunits O
was O
confirmed O
by O
immunocytochemistry O
in O
H4IIE B-CellLine
cells. O
Association O
of O
rAFAR2-2 B-Gene
with O
the O
Golgi O
apparatus O
presumably O
facilitates O
secretion O
of O
GHB, B-Chemical
and O
the O
novel O
N-terminal O
domain O
may O
either O
determine O
the O
targeting O
of O
the O
enzyme O
to O
the O
Golgi O
or O
regulate O
the O
secretory O
process. O
A O
murine B-Species
AKR O
protein O
of O
367 O
residues O
has O
been O
identified O
in O
expressed O
sequence O
tag O
databases O
that O
shares O
91% O
sequence O
identity O
with O
rAFAR2 B-Gene
and O
contains O
the O
Arg-rich O
extended O
N-terminus O
of O
40 O
amino O
acids. O
Further O
bioinformatic O
evidence O
is O
presented O
that O
full-length O
human B-Species
AKR7A2 B-Gene
is O
composed O
of O
359 O
amino O
acids O
and O
also O
possesses O
an O
additional O
N-terminal O
domain. O
On O
the O
basis O
of O
these O
observations, O
we O
conclude O
that O
AKR7 O
proteins O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
subfamilies, O
one O
of O
which O
is O
a O
Golgi-associated O
GHB B-Chemical
synthase O
with O
a O
unique, O
previously O
unrecognized, O
N-terminal O
domain O
that O
is O
absent O
from O
other O
AKR O
proteins. O
