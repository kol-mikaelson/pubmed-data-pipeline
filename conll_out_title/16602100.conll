# Abstract
Glutaric B-Disease
acidemias I-Disease
comprise O
different O
disorders O
resulting O
in O
an O
increased O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
glutaric B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Glutaric B-Disease
acidemia I-Disease
type I-Disease
1 I-Disease
(GA-1) B-Disease
is O
an O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
of O
lysine, B-Chemical
hydroxylysine, B-Chemical
and O
tryptophan B-Chemical
metabolism O
caused O
by O
deficiency B-Disease
of I-Disease
glutaryl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase. I-Disease
It O
results O
in O
the O
accumulation O
of O
3-hydroxyglutaric B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
glutaric B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Affected O
patients B-Species
can O
present O
with O
brain B-Disease
atrophy I-Disease
and O
macrocephaly B-Disease
and O
with O
acute O
dystonia B-Disease
secondary O
to O
striatal B-Disease
degeneration I-Disease
in O
most O
cases O
triggered O
by O
an O
intercurrent O
childhood O
infection B-Disease
with O

between O
6 O
and O
18 O
months O

age. O
This O
disorder O
can O
be O
identified O
by O
increased O
glutaryl B-Chemical
(C5DC) B-Chemical
carnitine B-Chemical
on O
newborn O
screening. O
Urine O
organic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
analysis O
indicates O
the O
presence O
of O
excess O
3-OH-glutaric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
urine O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
profile O
shows O
glutaryl B-Chemical
carnitine B-Chemical
as O
the O
major O
peak. O
Therapy O
consists O
in O
carnitine B-Chemical
supplementation O
to O
remove O
glutaric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
a O
diet O
restricted O
in O
amino O

capable O
of O
producing O
glutaric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
prompt O
treatment O
of O
intercurrent O
illnesses. O
Early O
diagnosis O
and O
therapy O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
acute O
