# Abstract
The O
HMG-CoA O
reductase O
inhibitors O
(statins) O
are O
effective O
in O
both O
the O
primary O
and O
secondary O
prevention O
of O
ischaemic B-Disease
heart I-Disease
disease. I-Disease
As O
a O
group, O
these O
drugs O
are O
well O
tolerated O
apart O
from O
two O
uncommon O
but O
potentially O
serious O
adverse O
effects: O
elevation O
of O
liver O
enzymes O
and O
skeletal O
muscle B-Disease
abnormalities, I-Disease
which O
range O
from O
benign O
myalgias B-Disease
to O
life-threatening O
rhabdomyolysis. B-Disease
Adverse O
effects O
with O
statins O
are O
frequently O
associated O
with O
drug O
interactions O
because O
of O
their O
long-term O
use O
in O
older O
patients B-Species
who O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
exposed O
to O
polypharmacy. O
The O
recent O
withdrawal O
of O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
as O
a O
result O
of O
deaths B-Disease
from O
rhabdomyolysis B-Disease
illustrates O
the O
clinical O
importance O
of O
such O
interactions. O
Drug O
interactions O
involving O
the O
statins O
may O
have O
either O
a O
pharmacodynamic O
or O
pharmacokinetic O
basis, O
or O
both. O
As O
these O
drugs O
are O
highly O
extracted O
by O
the O
liver, O
displacement O
interactions O
are O
of O
limited O
importance. O
The O
cytochrome O
P450 O
(CYP) O
enzyme O
system O
plays O
an O
important O
part O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
the O
statins, O
leading O
to O
clinically O
relevant O
interactions O
with O
other O
agents, O
particularly O
cyclosporin, B-Chemical
erythromycin, B-Chemical
itraconazole, B-Chemical
ketoconazole B-Chemical
and O
HIV B-Species
protease O
inhibitors, O
that O
are O
also O
metabolised O
by O
this O
enzyme O
system. O
An O
additional O
complicating O
feature O
is O
that O
individual O
statins O
are O
metabolised O
to O
differing O
degrees, O
in O
some O
cases O
producing O
active O
metabolites. O
The O
CYP3A B-Gene
family O
metabolises O
lovastatin, B-Chemical
simvastatin, B-Chemical
atorvastatin B-Chemical
and O
cerivastatin, B-Chemical
whereas O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
metabolises O
fluvastatin. B-Chemical
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
also O
metabolised O
by O
CYP2C8. B-Gene
Pravastatin B-Chemical
is O
not O
significantly O
metabolised O
by O
the O
CYP O
system. O
In O
addition, O
the O
statins O
are O
substrates O
for O
P-glycoprotein, B-Gene
a O
drug O
transporter O
present O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
that O
may O
influence O
their O
oral O
bioavailability. O
In O
clinical O
practice, O
the O
risk O
of O
a O
serious O
interaction O
causing O
myopathy B-Disease
is O
enhanced O
when O
statin O
metabolism O
is O
markedly O
inhibited. O
Thus, O
rhabdomyolysis B-Disease
has O
occurred O
following O
the O
coadministration O
of O
cyclosporin, B-Chemical
a O
potent O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
and O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
inhibitor, O
and O
lovastatin. B-Chemical
Itraconazole B-Chemical
has O
been O
shown O
to O
increase O
exposure O
to O
simvastatin B-Chemical
and O
its O
active O
metabolite O
by O
at O
least O
10-fold. O
Pharmacodynamically, O
there O
is O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
myopathy B-Disease
when O
statins O
are O
coprescribed O
with O
fibrates B-Chemical
or O
nicotinic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
This O
occurs O
relatively O
infrequently, O
but O
is O
particularly O
associated O
with O
the O
combination O
of O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
and O
gemfibrozil. B-Chemical
Statins O
may O
also O
alter O
the O
concentrations O
of O
other O
drugs, O
such O
as O
warfarin B-Chemical
or O
digoxin, B-Chemical
leading O
to O
alterations O
in O
effect O
or O
a O
requirement O
for O
clinical O
monitoring. O
Knowledge O
of O
the O
pharmacokinetic O
properties O
of O
the O
statins O
should O
allow O
the O
avoidance O
of O
the O
majority O
of O
drug O
interactions. O
If O
concurrent O
therapy O
with O
known O
inhibitors O
of O
statin O
metabolism O
is O
necessary, O
the O
patient B-Species
should O
be O
monitored O
for O
signs O
and O
symptoms O
of O
myopathy B-Disease
or O
rhabdomyolysis B-Disease
and O
the O
statin O
should O
be O
discontinued O
if O
necessary. O
