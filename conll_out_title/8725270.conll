Ethylmalonic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
is O
a O

The O

We O
have O
recently O
detected O
a O
guanine B-DNAMutation

adenine I-DNAMutation
polymorphism O
in O
the O
SCAD B-Gene
gene O
at O
position O

in O
the O
SCAD B-Gene
cDNA, O
which O
changes O
glycine B-ProteinMutation
209 I-ProteinMutation
to I-ProteinMutation
serine I-ProteinMutation
(G209S). B-ProteinMutation
The O
variant O
allele O
(A625) O
is O
present O
in O
homozygous O
and O
in O
heterozygous O
form O
in O
7 O
and O
34.8% O
of O
the O
general O
population, O
respectively. O
One O

and O
thirty-five O
patients B-Species
from O
Germany, O
Denmark, O
the O
Czech O
Republic, O
Spain, O
and O
the O
United O
States O
were O
selected O
for O
this O
study O
on O
the O
basis O

Among O
them, O
we O
found O
a O
significant O
overrepresentation O
of O
the O
variant O
allele. O
Eighty-one O
patients B-Species
(60%) O
were O
homozygous O
for O
the O
A625 O
allele, O
40 O
(30%) O
were O
heterozygous, O
and O
only O
14 O
(10%) O
harbored O
the O
wild-type O
allele O
(G625) O
in O
homozygous O
form. O
By O
overexpressing O
the O
wild-type O
and O
variant O
protein O
(G209S) B-ProteinMutation
in O
Escherichia B-Species

and O
COS B-CellLine
cells, O
we O
showed O
that O
the O
folding O
of O
the O
variant O
protein O
was O
slightly O
compromised O
in O
comparison O
to O
the O
wild-type O
and O
that O
the O
temperature O
stability O
of O
the O
tetrameric O
variant O
enzyme O
was O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
the O
wild O
type. O
Taken O
together, O
the O
over-representation O
and O
the O
biochemical O
studies O
indicate O
that O
the O
A625 O
allele O
confers O
susceptibility O
to O
the O
development O
of O
ethylmalonic B-Disease
aciduria. I-Disease
