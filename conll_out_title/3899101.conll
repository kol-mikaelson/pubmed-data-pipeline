# Abstract
Hindquarters O
from O
starved O
rats B-Species
were O
perfused O
without O
substrates O
but O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
an O
O2- B-Chemical
and O
CO2-carrying O
perfluorocarbon B-Chemical
emulsion O
to O
evaluate O
principally O
the O
metabolism O
of O
individual O
endogenous O
and O
protein-derived O
amino O
acids O
by O
this O
muscle O
preparation. O
This O
experimental O
model O
was O
shown, O
by O
a O
battery O
of O
metabolite O
measurements, O
to O
maintain O
cellular O
homoeostasis O
for O
at O
least O
2h. O
The O
net O
appearance O
of O
most O
amino O
acids O
closely O
approximated O
their O
frequency O
of O
occurrence O
in O
muscle O
proteins, O
showing O
that O
they O
are O
not O
significantly O
metabolized. O
Exceptions O
were O
the O
branched-chain B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
methionine B-Chemical
and O
those O
amino O
acids O
that O
are O
interconvertible O
with O
intermediates O
of O
the O
citrate B-Chemical
cycle O
and O
pyruvate B-Chemical
through O
coupled O
transaminations. O
The O
evidence O
indicates O
that O
only O
valine, B-Chemical
isoleucine, B-Chemical
aspartate B-Chemical
and O
probably O
methionine B-Chemical
can O
be O
catabolized O
by O
skeletal O
muscle O
to O
provide O
carbon B-Chemical
precursors O
for O
glutamate B-Chemical
glutamine B-Chemical
and O
alanine B-Chemical
that O
are O
formed O
de O
novo O
by O
protein-catabolic O
muscle. O
The O
protein-sparing O
effects O
of O
insulin O
and O
leucine B-Chemical
were O
confirmed. O
Although O
each O
decreased O
proteolysis O
and O
the O
net O
appearance O
of O
free O
amino O
acids, O
they O
were O
generally O
without O
effect O
on O
the O
ratios O
of O
amino O
acids O
formed. O
2-Chloro-4-methylvalerate B-Chemical
selectively O
stimulated O
the O
removal O
rate O
for O
the O
branched-chain B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
confirming O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
branched-chain O
oxo O
acid O
dehydrogenase O
normally O
limits O
the O
rate O
of O
their O
oxidation O
by O
muscle. O
It O
is O
also O
concluded O
that, O
since O
alanine B-Chemical
was O
not O
formed O
in O
excess O
of O
that O
found O
in O
muscle O
proteins O
when O
no O
glucose B-Chemical
was O
added O
as O
substrate, O
the O
excess O
of O
alanine B-Chemical
(carbon) B-Chemical
released O
from O
muscles O
in O
other O
studies O
is O
derived O
to O
a O
large O
extent, O
but O
not O
exclusively, O
from O
preformed O
carbohydrate. B-Chemical
