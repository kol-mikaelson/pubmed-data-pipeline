# Abstract
A O
novel O
asparaginase-like B-Gene
protein I-Gene
(ALP) B-Gene
of O
spermatozoa O
was O
cloned O
from O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
testis O
cDNA O
libraries O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
reactivity O
with O
antibodies O
produced O
after O
vasectomy. O
Although O
obstruction B-Disease
of I-Disease
the O
male O

is O
known O
to O
cause O
an O
immunologic O
response, O
few O
of O
the O
sperm O
antigens O
responsible O
for O
the O
generation O
of O
autoantibodies O
have O
been O
characterized. O
We O
are O
identifying O
proteins O
of O

from O
two-dimensional O
(2-D) O

of O
rat B-Species

The O
peptide O

from O
ALP, B-Gene
a O

matched O
to O
a O

These O
peptide O
sequences O
were O
used O
to O
clone O
a O
cDNA O
encoding O
a O
novel O

The O
new O
protein O
had O
a O
similarity O
to O
portions O
of O
L-asparaginases O
of O

(43%) O
and O
to O
glycosylasparaginases O
in O
animal O

(32%). O
Human B-Species
ALP B-Gene
cDNA O
was O
subsequently O
cloned. O
It O
showed O
77% O

to O
the O
rat B-Species

sequence O
and O
the O

Two O
observations O
verified O
that O
the O
correct O

had O
been O
cloned: O
1) O
the O
anti-rALP O
antibody O
reacted O
with O
both O
rALP B-Gene
and O
rat B-Species
sperm; O
and O
2) O
post-vasectomy O

suggesting O
that O
ALP B-Gene
is O
associated O

Northern O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
rat B-Species

was O
abundantly O
expressed O
in O
the O

but O
was O
also O
present O
in O
