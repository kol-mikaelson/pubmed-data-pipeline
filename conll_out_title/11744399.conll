# Abstract
The O
contributions O
of O
pulse O
radiolysis O
towards O
characterisation O
of O
unstable O
ortho-quinones B-Chemical
relevant O
to O
melanogenesis O
are O
reviewed. O
The O
quinones B-Chemical
discussed O
include O
dopaquinone, B-Chemical
the O
precursor O
of O
both O
eumelanogenesis O
and O
phaeomelanogenesis, O
and O
5-S-cysteinyldopaquinone, B-Chemical
an O
early O
component O
of O
the O
phaeomelanogenic O
pathway. O
Redox O
exchange O
between O
dopaquinone B-Chemical
and O
5-S-cysteinyldopa B-Chemical
is O
shown O
to O
be O
a O
determinant O
of O
the O
balance O
between O
eumelanogenesis O
and O
phaeomelanogenesis. O
Ortho-quinones B-Chemical
resulting O
from O
the O
oxidation O
of O
tertiary O
N,N-dialkylcatecholamines B-Chemical
cyclise O
to O
redox-inactive O
betaines B-Chemical
which O
fail O
to O
autoactivate O
tyrosinase. B-Gene
This O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
dopa B-Chemical
detected O
during O
melanogenesis O
catalysed O
by O
tyrosinase B-Gene
being O
formed O
indirectly O
by O
a O
combination O
of O
dopaquinone B-Chemical
intramolecular O
reductive O
addition O
to O

leucodopachrome B-Chemical
(cyclodopa), B-Chemical
followed O
by O
redox O
exchange O
between O
remaining O
dopaquinone B-Chemical
and O
leucodopachrome. B-Chemical
Rapid O
tautomerism O
of O
the O
ortho-quinone B-Chemical
of O
4-cyanomethylcatechol B-Chemical
to O
a O
redox-inactive O
quinomethane B-Chemical
likewise O
inhibits O
tyrosinase B-Gene
autoactivation. O
The O
incorporation O
of O
trihydric O
phenol B-Chemical
moieties O
in O
melanin B-Chemical
is O
modelled O
by O
the O
reactions O
of O
several O
ortho-quinones B-Chemical
with O
phloroglucinol, B-Chemical
which O
itself O
is O
not O
directly O
oxidised O
by O
tyrosinase B-Gene
due O
to O
the O
meta-positioning O
of O
the O
hydroxyl O
groups. O
The O
importance O
of O
a O
susceptibility O
towards O
nucleophilic O
attack O
as O
well O
as O
a O
propensity O
to O
undergo O
redox-exchange, O
in O
the O
chemistry O
of O
melanogenic O
ortho-quinones, B-Chemical
is O
emphasised. O
