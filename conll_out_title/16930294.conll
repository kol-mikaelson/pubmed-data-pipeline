# Abstract
Acetaminophen B-Chemical
overdose B-Disease
causes O
severe O
hepatic B-Disease
failure. I-Disease
Although O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
hepatotoxicity B-Disease
have O
been O
well O
investigated, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
involvement O
of O
the O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
in O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
transport O
and O
toxicity. B-Disease
P-Glycoprotein B-Gene
is O
a O
membrane O
efflux O
pump, O
playing O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
regulating O
absorption, O
excretion, O
and O
tissue O
distribution O
of O
many O
drugs. O
To O
evaluate O
the O
contribution O
of O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
transporter O
in O
the O
course O
of O
acetaminophen-induced O
toxicity, B-Disease
HepG2 B-CellLine
and O
Hep3B B-CellLine
cells O
with O
different O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
expression O
and O
activity, O
were O
treated O
by O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
(1-10 O
mM) O
for O
different O
time O
periods, O
with O
or O
without O
the O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
inhibitor O
verapamil. B-Chemical
P-Glycoprotein B-Gene
activity O
was O
determined O
by O
rhodamine B-Chemical
123 I-Chemical
efflux O
assay O
and O
western O
blot O
analysis. O
To O
assess O
the O
acetaminophen-induced O
toxicity B-Disease
and O
effect O
of O
verapamil, B-Chemical
we O
investigated O
cellular O
redox O
status, O
phosphatidylserine B-Chemical
externalization, O
nuclear O
fragmentation O
and O
ultrastructural O
changes. O
Verapamil B-Chemical
markedly O
enhanced O
acetaminophen-induced O
oxidative O
damage O
and O
cell O
death. O
Moreover, O
verapamil B-Chemical
revealed O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
toxicity B-Disease
even O
at O
subtoxic O
levels. O
High O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
concentrations O
increased O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
activity O
and O
content O
in O
both O
HepG2 B-CellLine
and O
Hep3B B-CellLine
cells. O
These O
observations O
suggest O
the O
involvement O
of O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
in O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
transport. O
Notwithstanding O
the O
differences O
of O
the O
investigated O
hepatoma B-Disease
cell O
lines O
in O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
function, O
acetaminophen-induced O
toxicity B-Disease
was O
similar, O
possibly O
due O
to O
different O
functions O
of O
drug-metabolizing O
systems. O
We O
conclude O
that O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
is O
a O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
substrate O
and O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
is O
involved O
in O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
transport O
and O
toxicity B-Disease
in O
HepG2 B-CellLine
and O
Hep3B B-CellLine
cells. O
This O
study O
establishes O
the O
fact O
that O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
can O
modulate O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
in O
tumour B-Disease
cells, O
suggesting O
that O
its O
routine O
use O
in O
cancer B-Disease
patients B-Species
in O
combination O
with O
anticancer O
drugs, O
may O
influence O
the O
result O
of O
chemotherapy. O
