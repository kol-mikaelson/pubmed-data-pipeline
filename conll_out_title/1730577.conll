# Abstract
3-Hydroxydicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
major O
urinary O
metabolites O
derived O
from O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism. O
These O
compounds O
are O
produced O
from O
the O
omega-oxidation O
of O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
The O

3-hydroxy B-Chemical

incomplete O
beta-oxidation O

fatty B-Chemical

was O
investigated. O
Independent O

the O

The O

3-hydroxy B-Chemical

3-Hydroxy B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
did O
not O
exist O
as O
pure O
L-enantiomer O
as O
expected O
from O
beta-oxidation. O
Instead, O
these O
metabolites O
were O
epimerized O
to O
a O
near O
racemic O
mixture O
of O
D- O
and O
L-isomers O
with O
a O
slightly O
dominant O
D-isomer O
(58 O
+ O
- O
3%). O
By O
using O
deuterium-isotope O
labeling, O
the O
mechanism O
of O
epimerizartion O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
a O
rapid O
dehydration-rehydration O
through O
trans-2-enoyl-CoA. B-Chemical
In O
addition, O
cis-3 B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
trans-3 I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
produced; O
these O
metabolites O
were O
derived O
from O
the O
isomerization O
of O
trans-2-enoyl-CoA. B-Chemical
Epimerase O
and O
isomerase O
were O
thought O
to O
be O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
the O
oxidation O
of O
unsaturated B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
Current O
data O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
metabolism O
of O
these O
acids O
is O
actually O
through O
NADPH-dependent O
reduction O
pathways. O
The O
