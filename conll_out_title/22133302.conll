# Abstract
Tissue O

ethylmalonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(EMA) B-Chemical
occur O
in O
ethylmalonic B-Disease
encephalopathy I-Disease
(EE) B-Disease
and O
short B-Disease
chain I-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease

deficiency I-Disease
(SCADD). B-Disease
Although O
these O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
disorders I-Disease
are O
clinically O
characterized O
by O
neurological B-Disease
abnormalities, I-Disease
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
the O
brain B-Disease
damage I-Disease
are O
poorly O
known. O
Considering O
that O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
neurotoxicity B-Disease
of O
EMA B-Chemical
and O
that O
hyperlacticacidemia B-Disease
occurs O
in O
EE B-Disease
and O
SCADD, B-Disease
we O
evaluated O
the O
effects O
of O
this O
metabolite O
on O
important O
parameters O
of O
oxidative O
metabolism O
in O
isolated O
rat B-Species
brain O

EMA B-Chemical
inhibited O
either O
ADP-stimulated O
or O
uncoupled O
mitochondrial O
respiration O
supported O
by O
succinate B-Chemical
and O
malate, B-Chemical
but O
not O
by O
glutamate B-Chemical
plus O
malate. B-Chemical
In O
addition, O
EMA B-Chemical
mildly O
stimulated O
oxygen B-Chemical
consumption O
by O
succinate-respiring O
mitochondria O
in O

state. O
Methylmalonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(MMA), B-Chemical
malonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(MA) O
and O
butylmalonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(BtMA) B-Chemical
had O
a O
similar O
effect O
on O
ADP-stimulated O
or O
uncoupled O
respiration. O
Furthermore, O
EMA-, B-Chemical
MMA- B-Chemical
and O
BtMA-induced O
inhibitory O
effects O
on O
succinate B-Chemical
oxidation O
were O
significantly O
minimized O
by O
nonselective O
permeabilization O
of O
the O
mitochondrial O
membranes O
by O
alamethicin, B-Chemical
whereas O
MA O
inhibitory O
effect O
was O
not O
altered. O
In O
addition, O
MA O
was O
the O
only O
tested O
compound O
that O
reduced O
succinate B-Chemical
dehydrogenase O
activity. O
We O
also O
observed O
that O
EMA B-Chemical
markedly O
inhibited O
succinate B-Chemical
and O
malate B-Chemical
transport O
through O
the O
mitochondrial O
dicarboxylate O
carrier. O
Mitochondrial O
membrane O
potential O
was O
also O
reduced O
by O
EMA B-Chemical
and O
MA, O
but O
not O
by O
MMA, B-Chemical
using O
succinate B-Chemical
as O
electron O
donor, O
whereas O
none O
of O
these O
compounds O
was O
able O
to O
alter O
the O
membrane O
potential O
using O
glutamate B-Chemical
plus O
malate B-Chemical
as O
electron O
donors. O
Taken O
together, O
our O
results O
strongly O
indicate O
that O
EMA B-Chemical
impairs O
succinate B-Chemical
and O
malate B-Chemical
uptake O
through O
the O
mitochondrial O
dicarboxylate O
carrier. O
