# Abstract
Long-chain B-Disease
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
an O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
affecting O
mitochondrial O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
due O
to O
mutations O
in O
the O
HADHA B-Gene
gene. O
We O
report O
on O
a O
22-month-old O
child O
who O
was O
identified O
on O
expanded O
newborn O
screening O
with O
an O
abnormal O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
pattern O
and O
increased O
C14OH. B-Chemical
Molecular O
analysis O
showed O
that O
the O
child O
was O
homozygous O
for O
the O
common O
mutation, O
c.1526G B-DNAMutation

C I-DNAMutation
(p.Glu510Gln) B-ProteinMutation
in O
the O
HADHA B-Gene
gene. O
Carrier O
testing O
on O
the O
parental O
samples O
revealed O
that O
the O
father O
was O
heterozygous O
for O
the O
mutation O
whereas O
the O
mother O
did O
not O
carry O
the O
mutation. O

tandem O
repeat O
testing O

markers O
covering O
both O

arms O
of B-Disease
chromosome I-Disease

showed O
that O
the O

We O
highlight O
the O
importance O
of O
parental O
testing O
in O
