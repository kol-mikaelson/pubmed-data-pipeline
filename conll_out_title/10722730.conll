# Abstract
Proteins O
containing O
the O
Nudix O
box O
"GX(5)EX(7)REUXEEXGU" O
(where O
U O
is O
usually O
Leu, O
Val, O
or O
Ile) O
are O
Nudix O
hydrolases, O
which O
catalyze O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
a O
variety O
of O
nucleoside B-Chemical
diphosphate I-Chemical
derivatives. I-Chemical
Here O
we O
report O
cloning O
and O
characterization O
of O
a O
human B-Species
cDNA O
encoding O
a O
novel O
nudix O
hydrolase O
NUDT5 B-Gene
for O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
ADP-sugars. B-Chemical
The O
deduced O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
of O
NUDT5 B-Gene
contains O
219 O
amino O
acids, O
including O
a O
conserved O
Nudix O
box O
sequence. O
The O
recombinant O
NUDT5 B-Gene
was O
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
purified O
to O
near O
homogeneity. O
At O
the O
optimal O
pH O
of O
7, O
the O
purified O
recombinant O
NUDT5 B-Gene
catalyzed O
hydrolysis O
of O
two O
major O
substrates O
ADP-ribose B-Chemical
and O
ADP-mannose B-Chemical
with O
K(m) O
values O
of O
32 O
and O
83 O
microM, O
respectively; O
the O
V(max) O
for O
ADP-mannose B-Chemical
was O
about O
1.5 O
times O
that O
with O
ADP-ribose. B-Chemical
The O
murine B-Species
NUDT5 B-Gene
homolog O
was O
also O
cloned O
and O
characterized. O
mNudT5 O
has O
81% O
amino O
acid O
identity O
to O
NUDT5 B-Gene
with O
catalytic O
activities O
similar O
to O
NUDT5 B-Gene
under O
the O
optimal O
pH O

9. O
Both O
NUDT5 B-Gene
and O
mNudT5 O
transcripts O
were O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
in O
tissues O
analyzed O
with O
preferential O
abundance O
in O
liver. O
The O
genomic O
structures O
of O
both O
NUDT5 B-Gene
and O
mNudT5 O
were O
determined O
and O
located O
on O
human B-Species
chromosome B-Chromosome
10 I-Chromosome
and O
mouse B-Species
chromosome B-Chromosome
2, I-Chromosome
respectively. O
The O
role O
of O
NUDT5 B-Gene
in O
maintaining O
levels O
of O
free O
ADP-ribose B-Chemical
in O
cells O
is O
