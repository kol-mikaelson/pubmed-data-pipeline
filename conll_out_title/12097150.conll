# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
In O
mammals, O
L-threonine B-Chemical
is O
an O
indispensable O
amino O
acid. O
The O
conversion O
of O
L-threonine B-Chemical
to O
glycine B-Chemical
occurs O
through O
a O
two-step O
biochemical O
pathway O
involving O
the O
enzymes O
L-threonine B-Chemical
3-dehydrogenase O
and O
2-amino-3-ketobutyrate O
coenzyme O
A O
ligase. O
The O
L-threonine B-Chemical
3-dehydrogenase O
enzyme O
has O
been O
purified O
and O
characterised, O
but O
the O
L-threonine B-Chemical
3-dehydrogenase O
gene O
has O
not O
previously O
been O
identified O
in O
mammals. O
RESULTS: O
Transcripts O
for O
L-threonine B-Chemical
3-dehydrogenase O
from O
both O
the O
mouse B-Species
and O
pig B-Species
are O
reported. O
The O
ORFs O
of O
both O
L-threonine B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
cDNAs O
encode O
proteins O
of O
373 O
residues O
(41.5 O
kDa) O
and O
they O
share O
80% O
identity. O
The O
mouse B-Species
gene O
is O
located O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
14, I-Chromosome
band O
C. O
The O
amino-terminal O
regions O
of O
these O
proteins O
have O
characteristics O
of O
a O
mitochondrial O
targeting O
sequence O
and O
are O
related O
to O
the O
UDP-galactose O
4-epimerases, O
with O
both O
enzyme O
families O
having O
an O
amino-terminal O
NAD+ B-Chemical
binding O
domain. O
That O
these O
cDNAs O
encode O
threonine O
dehydrogenases O
was O
shown, O
previously, O
by O
tiling O
13 O
tryptic O
peptide O
sequences, O
obtained O
from O
purified O
L-threonine B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
isolated O
from O
porcine B-Species
liver O
mitochondria, O
on O
to O
the O
pig B-Species
ORF. O
These O
eukaryotic O
L-threonine B-Chemical
dehydrogenases O
also O
have O
significant O
similarity O
with O
the O
prokaryote O
L-threonine B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
amino-terminus O
peptide O
sequence O
of O
the O
bacterium, O
Clostridium B-Species
sticklandii. I-Species
In O
murine B-Species
tissues, O
the O
expression O
of O
both O
L-threonine B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
and O
2-amino-3-ketobutyrate O
coenzyme O
A O
ligase O
mRNAs O
were O
highest O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
were O
also O
present O
in O
brain, O
heart, O
kidney, O
liver, O
lung, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
spleen O
and O
testis. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
first O
cloning O
of O
transcripts O
for O
L-threonine B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
from O
eukaryotic O
organisms O
are O
reported. O
However, O
they O
