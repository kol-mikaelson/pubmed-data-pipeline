# Abstract
When O
authors O
of O
general O
biochemistry O
textbooks O
mention O
carrier O
proteins O
involved O
in O
the O
transport O
of O
oxaloacetate B-Chemical
across O
the O
inner O
mitochondrial O
membrane O
for O
gluconeogenesis, O
they O
only O
make O
use O
of O
the O
two O
transporters O
involved O
in O
the O
malate-aspartate O
shuttle. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
only O
using O
the O
malate-2-oxoglutarate O
and O
the O
glutamate-aspartate O
carrier O
proteins, O
I O
show O
that O
the O
reaction O
describing O
the O
overall O
process O
is O
unsatisfactory O
since, O
in O
addition O
to O
oxaloacetate B-Chemical
being O
transported O
from O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix O
to O
the O
cytosol, O
2-oxoglutarate B-Chemical
is O
also O
transported O
in O
the O
reverse O
direction. O
I O
therefore O
point O
out O
that, O
if O
only O
oxaloacetate B-Chemical
is O
to O
be O
transported O
from O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix O
to O
the O
cytosol, O
then O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
also O
make O
use O
of O
other O
carrier O
proteins O
in O
the O
inner O
mitochondrial O
membrane, O
namely, O
the O
dicarboxylate O
transporter O
and O
the O
phosphate O
transporter. O
