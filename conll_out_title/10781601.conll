# Abstract
Using O
an O
expression O
cloning O
strategy, O
the O
cDNA O
encoding O
the O
human B-Species
HNK-1 B-Gene
sulfotransferase I-Gene
(HNK-1ST) B-Gene
has O
been O
cloned. O
During O
this O
cloning O
we O
found O
that O
HNK-1ST B-Gene
and O
other O
Golgi-associated O
sulfotransferases O
cloned O
before O
share O
homologous O
sequences O
including O
the O
RDP O

Using O
this O
conserved O
sequence O
in O
HNK-1ST B-Gene
as O
a O
probe, O
we O
identified O
two O
expressed O
sequence O

in O
EST O

base O
which O
have O
31.6 O
and O
30.7% O
identity O
with O
HNK-1ST B-Gene
at O
the O
amino O

levels. O
Expression O
of O
these O
two O
full-length O
cDNAs O
failed O
to O
form O
HNK-1 B-Gene
glycan O
nor O

add O
sulfate B-Chemical

CD34 B-Gene
or O

Surprisingly, O
proteins O
expressed O
by O
these O
cDNAs O
transferred O
sulfate B-Chemical
to O
the O
C-4 O
position O
of O
N-acetylgalactosamine B-Chemical
in O
chondroitin B-Chemical
and O
desulfated B-Chemical
dermatan B-Chemical
sulfate, I-Chemical
thus O
we O
named O
these O
two O
enzymes, O
chondroitin B-Chemical
4-O-sulfotransferase I-Gene
1 I-Gene
and I-Gene
-2 I-Gene
(C4ST-1 B-Gene
and O
C4ST-2). B-Gene
Both O
C4ST-1 B-Gene
and O
C4ST-2, B-Gene
however, O
did O
not O
form O
4, B-Chemical
6-di-O-sulfated I-Chemical
N-acetylgalactosamine B-Chemical
when O
chondroitin B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
C I-Chemical
was O
used O
as O
an O
acceptor. O
Moreover, O
analysis O
of O
(35)S-labeled O
dermatan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
formed O
by O
C4ST-1 B-Gene
indicate O
that O
sulfation O
preferentially O
took O
place O
in O
GlcA-->GalNAc O
unit O
than O
in O
IdoA-->GalNAc O
unit, O
suggesting O
that O
4-O-sulfation O
at O
N-acetylgalactosamine B-Chemical
may O
precede O
epimerization O
of O
glucuronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
iduronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
during O
dermatan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
Northern O
analysis O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
transcript O
for O
C4ST-1 B-Gene
is O
predominantly O
expressed O
in O
peripheral O
leukocytes O
and O
hematopoietic O
tissues O
while O
the O
C4ST-2 B-Gene
transcript O
is O
more O
widely O
expressed O
in O
various O
tissues. O
These O
results O
indicate O
C4ST-1 B-Gene
and O
C4ST-2 B-Gene
play O
complementary O
roles O
in O
chondroitin B-Chemical
and O
dermatan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
synthesis O
in O
different O
tissues. O
