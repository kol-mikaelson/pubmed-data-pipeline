# Abstract
Lysine, B-Chemical
an O
essential O
amino O
acid O
is O
catabolized O
in O
brain O
through O
only O
the O
pipecolic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
pathway. O
During O
the O
formation O
of O
pipecolic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
alpha-deamination O
of O
lysine, B-Chemical
and O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
alpha-keto B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
its O
cyclized O
product O
are O
pre-requisites. O
The O
enzyme O
mediated O
alpha-deamination O
of O
L-lysine B-Chemical
and O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
alpha-keto B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
the O
cyclized O
product O
are O
not O
demonstrated O
so O
far. O
Both O
lysine B-Chemical
and O
pipecolic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
are O
known O
to O
increase O
in O
brain O
under O
the O
conditions O
of O
fasting, O
studies O
were O
therefore O
undertaken O
to O
identify O
the O
enzyme O
responsible O
for O
the O
alpha-deamination O
of O
L-lysine B-Chemical
in O
the O
brain O
tissue O
of O
mice B-Species
which O
were O
fasted. O
The O
detection O
of O
the O
alpha-keto B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
of I-Chemical
L-lysine B-Chemical
-alpha-keto-epsilon-amino O
caproic O
acid O
and O
its O
cyclized O
product-delta-piperidine-2-carboxylate O
was O
facilitated O
by O
the O
use O
of O
L-[U-14C]-lysine B-Chemical
as O
the O
substrate. O
The O
quantitation O
of O
the O
radioactivity O
in O
reaction O
products O
was O
done O
after O
separation O
by O
ion O
exchange O
chromatographic O
methods. O
The O
formation O
of O
the O
alpha-keto B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
was O
enzyme O
mediated, O
the O
alpha-keto B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
formed O
was O
established O
by O
reaction O
with O
N-methyl B-Chemical
benzothiazolinone I-Chemical
hydrazone I-Chemical
hydrochloride. I-Chemical
The O
cyclized O
product O
was O
accounted O
in O
a O
fraction O
which O
matched O
the O
resolution O
of O
authentic O
pipecolic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
on O
the O
Dowex O
column, O
and O
the O
cyclized O
product O
was O
confirmed O
by O
spectrophotometry. O
The O
hitherto O
undemonstrated O
alpha-amino O
deaminating O
enzyme O
of O
L-lysine B-Chemical
in O
brain O
tissue, O
the O
alpha-keto B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
of I-Chemical
L-lysine B-Chemical
and O
its O
cyclized O
product O
in O
a O
mammalian O
system O
could O
thus O
be O
demonstrated O
in O
the O
present O
study. O
These O
findings O
confirm O
the O
involvement O
of O
L-lysine B-Chemical
oxidase O
L-amino B-Gene
acid I-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
in O
the O
formation O
of O
pipecolic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
from O
L-lysine. B-Chemical
