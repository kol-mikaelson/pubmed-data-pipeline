# Abstract
S-adenosyl-L-methionine B-Chemical
(SAMe) B-Chemical
is O
an O
endogenous O
molecule O
that O
is O
known O
to O
be O
protective O
against O
hepatotoxic B-Disease
injury. I-Disease
Although O
oral O
SAMe B-Chemical
appears O
to O
be O
absorbed O
across O
the O
intestinal O
mucosa, O
its O
systemic O
bioavailability O
is O
low. O
The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
unknown. O
Using O
the O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cell O
culture O
model O
for O
enterocyte O
absorption, O
we O
determined O
the O
mode O
by O
which O
SAMe B-Chemical
is O
transported O
across O
this O
cell O
monolayer. O
We O
also O
determined O
the O
extent O
it O
is O
taken O
up O
by O
both O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
and O
hepatocytes. O
In O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
transport O
was O
observed O
in O
both O
apical O
to O
basolateral O
and O
basolateral O
to O
apical O
directions. O
The O
apparent O
permeability O
coefficients O
(Papp) O
appeared O
to O
be O
concentration O
independent O
and O
were O
similar O
in O
both O
directions O
(0.7x10(-6) O
and O
0.6x10(-6) O
cm O
s-1, O
respectively), O
i.e. O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
paracellular O
transport O
marker O
mannitol B-Chemical
(0.9x10(-6) O
and O
0.7x10(-6) O
cm O
s-1). O
This O
mode O
of O
transport O
was O
supported O
by O
a O
four-fold O
increase O
in O
the O
Papp O
for O
SAMe B-Chemical
transport O
in O
Ca++-free O
buffer. O
Cellular O
uptake O
of O
SAMe B-Chemical
was O
examined O
in O
both O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
and O
cultured O
rat B-Species
hepatocytes. O
Uptake O
by O
hepatocytes O
was O
not O
saturable O
in O
a O
concentration O
range O
of O
0.001-100 O
microM. O
Accumulation O
by O
both O
cell O
types O
was O
very O
low, O
with O
a O
cell:medium O
ratio O
at O
equilibrium O
of O
only O
0.2-0.5. O
This O
low O
cell O
accumulation O
supports O
the O
finding O
of O
paracellular O
transport O
as O
the O
only O
mode O
of O
cell O
membrane O
transport. O
Increased O
hepatocellular O
protection O
for O
SAMe B-Chemical
may O
be O
accomplished O
by O
converting O
SAMe B-Chemical
to O
a O
more O
lipid-soluble O
prodrug. O
