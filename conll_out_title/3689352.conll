# Abstract
Perfused O
rat B-Species
hindquarter O
preparations O
were O
shown O
to O
incorporate O
radioactivity O
from O
[U-14C]methionine B-Chemical
into O
citrate-cycle O
intermediates, O
lactate, B-Chemical
alanine, B-Chemical
glutamate, B-Chemical
glutamine B-Chemical
and O
CO2. B-Chemical
During O
perfusion, O
large O
amounts O
of O
methionine B-Chemical
were O
also O
oxidized O
to O
methionine B-Chemical
sulphoxide. I-Chemical
The O
capacity O
for O
transamination O
of O
methionine B-Chemical
or O
its O
oxo O
analogue, O
4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate, B-Chemical
by O
muscle O
extracts O
was O
demonstrated. O
Rat B-Species
skeletal O
muscle, O
heart, O
liver O
and O
kidney O
mitochondria, O
when O
incubated O
with O
the O
latter O
plus O
radiolabelled O
carnitine, B-Chemical
formed O
a O
newly O
identified O
carnitine B-Chemical
derivative, O
3-methylthiopropionylcarnitine. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
the O
capacity O
for O
oxidation O
of O
methionine B-Chemical
by O
a O
trans-sulphuration-independent O
pathway O
occurs O
in O
several O
mammalian O
tissues. O
The O
extent O
of O
inter-organ O
handling O
of O
intermediates O
in O
this O
pathway(s) O
is O
discussed. O
