# Abstract
Organic B-Chemical
anion I-Chemical
transporting O
polypeptide O
(oatp) O
is O
an O
integral O
membrane O
protein O
cloned O
from O
rat B-Species
liver O
that O
mediates O
Na+-independent O
transport O
of O
organic B-Chemical
anions O
such O
as O
sulfobromophthalein B-Chemical
and O
taurocholic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Previous O
studies O
in O

suggested O
that O
organic B-Chemical
anion I-Chemical

is O
associated O
with O

To O
better O

the O

of O

organic B-Chemical

we O
examined O
transport O

These O

We O
