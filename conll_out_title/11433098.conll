# Abstract
Very B-Disease
long I-Disease
chain I-Disease
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
dehydrogenase I-Disease
(VLCAD) B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
a O
rare O
but O
treatable O
cause O
of O
cardiomyopathy, B-Disease
fatty B-Disease
liver, I-Disease
skeletal B-Disease
myopathy, I-Disease
pericardial B-Disease
effusions, I-Disease
ventricular B-Disease
arrhythmias, B-Disease
and O
sudden B-Disease
death. B-Disease
Unrecognized, O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
may O
be O
rapidly O
progressive O
and O
fatal, O
secondary O
to O
its O
cardiac B-Disease
involvement. I-Disease
Because O
early O
diagnosis O
improves O
outcome, O
we O
present O
a O
neonate O
with O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
in O
whom O
retrospective O
analysis O
of O
the O
newborn O
screening O
card O
revealed O
that O
a O
correct O
diagnosis O
could O
have O
been O
made O
by O
newborn O
screening O
using O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry. O
Our O
patient B-Species
demonstrated O
a O
classic O
neonatal O
course O
with O
transient O
hypoglycemia B-Disease
at O
birth, O
interpreted O
as O
culture-negative O
sepsis, B-Disease
followed O
by O
a O
quiescent O
period O
notable O
only O
for O
hypotonia B-Disease
and O
poor O
feeding. O
At O
3 O
months, O
he O
presented O
with O
cardiorespiratory B-Disease
failure I-Disease
and O
pericardial B-Disease
effusions, I-Disease
requiring O
pericardiocentesis, O
tracheostomy, O
and O
prolonged O
mechanical O
ventilation. O
Plasma O
free-fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
profiles O
demonstrated O
small O
but O
significant O
elevations O
of O
C14:2, B-Chemical
C14:1, B-Chemical
C16, B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
C18:1 I-Chemical
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
species, O
findings O
consistent O
with O
a O
biochemical O
diagnosis O
of O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
Enteral O
feeds O
were O
changed O
to O
Portagen O
formula O
with O
marked O
improvement O
in O
cardiac B-Disease
symptoms I-Disease
over O
several O
weeks. O
To O
confirm O
the O
biochemical O
diagnosis, O
molecular O
analysis O
was O
performed O
by O
analysis O
of O
genomic O
DNA O
on O
a O
blood O
sample O
of O
the O
patient. B-Species
Sequencing O
analysis O
and O
delineation O
of O
VLCAD O
mutations O
were O
performed O
using O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
and O
genomic O
sequencing. O
The O
patient B-Species
was O
heterozygous O
for O
2 O
different O
disease-causing O
mutations O
at O
the O
VLCAD O
locus. O
The O
maternal O
mutation O
was O
a O
deletion B-DNAMutation
of I-DNAMutation
bp I-DNAMutation
842-3 I-DNAMutation
in O
exon O
8, O
causing O
a O
shift O
in O
the O
reading O
frame. O
The O
paternal O
mutation O
was O
G+1A B-DNAMutation
in O
the O
consensus O
donor O
splice O
site O
after O
exon O
1; O
this O
splice-site O
mutation O
would O
likely O
result O
in O
decreased O
mRNA. O
The O
likely O
consequence O
of O
these O
mutations O
is O
essentially O
a O
null O
phenotype. O
To O
determine O
whether O
this O
case O
could O
have O
been O
picked O
up O
by O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
analysis O
at O
birth O
when O
the O
patient B-Species
was O
asymptomatic, O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
analysis O
was O
performed O
on O
the O
patient's B-Species
original O
newborn O
card O
(after O
obtaining O
parental O
consent, O

original O
specimen O
was O

The O
blood O
sample O
had O
been O
obtained O
at O
1 O
week O
of O
age O
and O
stored O
at O
room O
temperature O
for O
6 O

and O
at O

thereafter O
for O

source. O
The O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
profile O
obtained O
from O
the O
patient's B-Species
original O
newborn O
card O
was O
analyzed O
2 O
years O
after O
it O
was O
obtained. O
In O
comparison O
with O
a O
normal O
control, O
there O
was O
a O
significant O
accumulation O
of O
long O
chain O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
species, O
with O
a O
prominent O
peak O
of O
tetradecenoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(C14:1), B-Chemical
the O
most O
characteristic O
metabolic O
marker O
of O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
This O
profile O
would O
have O
likely O
been O
even O
more O
significant O
if O
it O
had O
been O
analyzed O
at O
the O
time O
of O
collection, O
yet O
2 O
years O
later O
is O
sufficient O
to O
provide O
strong O
biochemical O
evidence O
of O
the O
underlying O
disorder. O
Discussion. O
VLCAD O
was O
first O
discovered O
in O
1992, O
and O
clinical O
experience O
with O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
has O
been O
accumulating O
rapidly. O
Indeed, O
the O
patients B-Species
originally O
diagnosed O
with O
long B-Disease
chain I-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
suffer O
instead O
from O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
The O
phenotype O
of O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
heterogeneous, O
ranging O
from O
catastrophic O
metabolic B-Disease
and I-Disease
cardiac I-Disease
failure I-Disease
in O
infancy O
to O
mild O
hypoketotic, B-Disease
hypoglycemia, B-Disease
and O
exertional B-Disease
rhabdomyolysis I-Disease
in O
adults. O
This O
case O
demonstrates O
that O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
could O
have O
been O
detected O
from O
the O
patient's B-Species
own O
neonatal O
heel-stick O
sample. O
Most O
likely, O
a O
presymptomatic O
diagnosis O
would O
have O
avoided O
at O
least O
part O
of O
a O
lengthy O
and O
intensive O
prediagnosis O
hospitalization O
that O
had O
an O
estimated O
cost O
of O
$400 O
000. O
Although O
VLCAD O
is O
relatively O
rare, O
timely O
and O
correct O
diagnosis O
leads O
to O
dramatic O
recovery, O
so O
that O
detection O
by O
newborn O
screening O
could O
prevent O
the O
onset O
of O
arrhythmias, B-Disease
heart B-Disease
failure, I-Disease
metabolic B-Disease
insufficiency, I-Disease
and O
death. B-Disease
Fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
defects, O
including O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
may O
account O
for O
as O
many O
as O
5% O
of O
sudden B-Disease
infant I-Disease
death I-Disease
patients. B-Species
Recent O
instrumentation O
advances O
have O
made O
automated O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
of O
routine O
neonatal O
heel-stick O
samples O
technically O
feasible. O
Pilot O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
an O
incidence O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
defects, O
including O
short O
chain, O
medium O
chain, B-Disease
and I-Disease
very I-Disease
long I-Disease
chain I-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiencies, I-Disease
of O
approximately O
1 O
12 O
000. O
As O
a O
result, O
cost-benefit O
ratios O
for O
this O
approach O
should O
be O
systematically O
examined. O
