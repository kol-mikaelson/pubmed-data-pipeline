# Abstract
A O
computer-based O
screen O
of O
the O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
genome O
identified O
YJR019C B-Gene
as O
a O
candidate O
oleate-induced O
gene. O
YJR019C B-Gene
mRNA O
levels O
were O
increased O
significantly O
during O
growth O
on O
fatty B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
it O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism. O
The O
YJR019C B-Gene
product O
is O
highly O
similar O
to O
tesB, O
a O
bacterial O
acyl-CoA B-Gene
thioesterase, B-Chemical
and O
carries O
a O
tripeptide O
sequence, O
alanine-lysine-phenylalanineCOOH, O
that O
closely O
resembles O
the O
consensus O
sequence O
for O
type-1 O
peroxisomal O
targeting O
signals. O
YJR019C B-Gene
directed O
green O
fluorescence O
protein O
to O
peroxisomes, O
and O
biochemical O
studies O
revealed O
that O
YJR019C B-Gene
is O
an O
abundant O
component O
of O
purified O
yeast B-Species
peroxisomes. O
Disruption O
of O
the O
YJR019C B-Gene
gene O
caused O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
total O
cellular O
thioesterase B-Chemical

and O
recombinant O
YJR019C B-Gene
was O
found O

exhibit O
intrinsic O

mg. O
YJR019C B-Gene
also O
shared O
significant O
sequence O
similarity O
with O
hTE, B-Gene
a O
human B-Species
thioesterase B-Chemical
that O
was O
previously O
identified O
because O
of O
its O
interaction O
with O
human B-Species
immunodeficiency O
virus-Nef O
in O
the O
yeast B-Species
two-hybrid O
assay. O
We O
report O
here O
that O
hTE B-Gene
is O
also O
a O
peroxisomal O
protein, O
demonstrating O
that O
thioesterase B-Chemical
activity O
is O
a O
conserved O
feature O
of O
peroxisomes. O
We O
propose O
that O
YJR019C B-Gene
and O
hTE B-Gene
be O
renamed O
as O
yeast B-Species
and O
human B-Species
PTE1 B-Gene
to O
reflect O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
encode O
peroxisomal O
thioesterases. O
The O
physical O
segregation O
of O
yeast B-Species
and O
human B-Species
PTE1 B-Gene
from O
the O
cytosolic O
fatty B-Gene
acid I-Gene
synthase I-Gene
suggests O
that O
these O
enzymes O
are O
unlikely O
to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
formation O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
Instead, O
the O
observation O
that O
PTE1 B-Gene
contributes O
to O
growth O
on O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
implicates O
this O
thioesterase B-Chemical
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation. O
