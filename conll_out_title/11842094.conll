# Abstract
Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate O
amidotransferase O
(GFAT) B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
first O
committed O
step O
in O
the O
pathway O
for O
biosynthesis O
of O
hexosamines B-Chemical
in O
mammals. O
A O
member O
of O
the O
N-terminal O
nucleophile O
class O
of O
amidotransferases, O
GFAT B-Gene
transfers O
the O
amino O
group O
from O
the O
L-glutamine B-Chemical
amide B-Chemical
to O
D-fructose B-Chemical
6-phosphate, I-Chemical
producing O
glutamic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
glucosamine B-Chemical
6-phosphate. I-Chemical
The O

Utilizing O

GFAT1 B-Gene
(hGFAT1) O
exhibited O
a O

microm, O
and O
was O
highly O

by O
GlcN-6-P. B-Chemical
In O
a O
second O
assay O
method O
that O
measures O
the O
stimulation O
of O
glutaminase B-Gene
activity, O
a O
K(d) O
of O
2 O
microm O
was O
measured O
for O
Fru-6-P B-Chemical
binding O
to O
hGFAT1. O
Further, O
we O
report O
that O
the O
product, O
GlcN-6-P, B-Chemical
is O
a O
potent O
competitive O
inhibitor O
for O
the O
Fru-6-P B-Chemical
site, O
with O
a O
K(i) O
measured O
of O
6 O
microm. O
Unlike O
other O
members O
of O
the O
amidotransferase O
family, O
where O
glutamate B-Chemical
production O
is O
loosely O
coupled O
to O
amide B-Chemical
transfer, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
hGFAT1 O
production O
of O
glutamate B-Chemical
and O
GlcN-6-P B-Chemical
are O
strictly O
coupled O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
inhibitors. O
Similar O
to O
other O
amidotransferases, O
competitive O
inhibitors O
that O
bind O
at O
the O
synthase O
site O
may O
inhibit O
the O
synthase O
activity O
without O
inhibiting O
the O
glutaminase B-Gene
activity O
at O
the O
hydrolase O
domain. O
GlcN-6-P, B-Chemical
for O
example, O
inhibited O
the O
transfer O
reaction O
while O
fully O
activating O
the O
glutaminase B-Gene
activity O
at O
the O
hydrolase O
domain. O
Inhibition O
of O
hGFAT1 O
by O
the O
end O
product O
of O
the O
pathway, O
UDP-GlcNAc, B-Chemical
was O
competitive O
with O
a O
K(i) O
of O
4 O
microm. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
hGFAT1 O
is O
fully O
active O
at O
physiological O
levels O
of O
Fru-6-P B-Chemical
and O
may O
be O
