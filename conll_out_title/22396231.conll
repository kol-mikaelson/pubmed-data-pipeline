# Abstract
Plasma O
membrane O
monoamine O
transporter O
(PMAT) O
is O
a O
polyspecific O
organic O
cation O
(OC) O
transporter O
that O
transports O
a O
variety O
of O
endogenous O
biogenic O
amines B-Chemical
and O
xenobiotic O
cations. O
Previous O
radiotracer O
uptake O
studies O
showed O
that O
PMAT-mediated O
OC O
transport O
is O
sensitive O
to O
changes O
in O
membrane O
potential O
and O
extracellular O
pH, O
but O
the O
precise O
role O
of O
membrane O
potential O
and O
protons O
on O
PMAT-mediated O
OC O
transport O
is O
unknown. O
Here, O
we O
characterized O
the O
electrophysiological O
properties O
of O
PMAT O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
using O
a O
two-microelectrode O
voltage-clamp O
approach. O
PMAT-mediated O
histamine B-Chemical
uptake O
is O
associated O
with O
inward O
currents O
under O
voltage-clamp O
conditions, O
and O
the O
currents O
increased O
in O
magnitude O
as O
the O
holding O
membrane O
potential O
became O
more O
negative. O
A O
similar O
effect O
was O
also O
observed O
for O
another O
cation, O
nicotine. O
Substrate-induced O
currents O
were O
largely O
independent O
of O
Na+ O
but O
showed O
strong O
dependence O
on O
membrane O
potential O
and O
pH O
of O
the O
perfusate. O
Detailed O
kinetic O
analysis O
of O
histamine B-Chemical
uptake O
revealed O
that O
the O
energizing O
effect O
of O
membrane O
potentials O
on O
PMAT O
transport O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
an O
augmentation O
of O
Imax O
with O
little O
effect O
on O
K0.5. O
At O
most O
holding O
membrane O
potentials, O
Imax O
at O
pH O
6.0 O
is O
approximately O
3- O
to O
4-fold O
higher O
than O
that O
at O
pH O
7.5, O
whereas O
K0.5 O
is O
not O
dependent O
on O
pH. O
Together, O
these O
data O
unequivocally O
demonstrate O
PMAT O
as O
an O
electrogenic O
transporter O
and O
establish O
the O
physiological O
inside-negative O
membrane O
potential O
as O
a O
driving O
force O
for O
PMAT-mediated O
OC O
transport. O
The O
important O
role O
of O
membrane O
potential O
and O
pH O
in O
modulating O
the O
transport O
activity O
of O
PMAT O
toward O
OCs O
suggests O
that O
the O
in O
vivo O
activity O
of O
PMAT O
could O
be O
regulated O
by O
pathophysiological O
processes O
that O
alter O
physiological O
pH O
or O
membrane O
potential. O
