# Abstract
Human B-Species
heart O
short O
chain O
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA B-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
(SCHAD) B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
oxidation O
of O
the O
hydroxyl O
group O
of O
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA B-Chemical
to O
a O
keto O
group, O
concomitant O
with O
the O
reduction O
of O
NAD+ B-Chemical
to O
NADH, B-Chemical
as O
part O
of O
the O
beta-oxidation O
pathway. O
The O
homodimeric O
enzyme O
has O
been O
overexpressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli, I-Species
purified O
to O
homogeneity, O
and O
studied O
using O
biochemical O
and O
crystallographic O
techniques. O
The O
dissociation O
constants O
of O
NAD+ B-Chemical
and O
NADH B-Chemical
have O
been O
determined O
over O
a O
broad O
pH O
range O
and O
indicate O
that O
SCHAD B-Gene
binds O
reduced O
cofactor O
preferentially. O
Examination O
of O
apparent O
catalytic O
constants O
reveals O
that O
SCHAD B-Gene
displays O
optimal O
enzymatic O
activity O
near O
neutral O
pH, O
with O
catalytic O
efficiency O
diminishing O
rapidly O
toward O
pH O
extremes. O
The O
crystal O
structure O
of O
SCHAD B-Gene
complexed O
with O
NAD+ B-Chemical
has O
been O
solved O
using O
multiwavelength O
anomalous O
diffraction O
techniques O
and O
a O
selenomethionine-substituted O
analogue O
of O
the O
enzyme. O
The O
subunit O
structure O
is O
comprised O
of O
two O
domains. O
The O
first O
domain O
is O
similar O
to O
other O
alpha O
beta O
dinucleotide O
folds O
but O
includes O
an O
unusual O
helix-turn-helix O
motif O
which O
extends O
from O
the O
central O
beta-sheet. O
The O
second, O
or O
C-terminal, O
domain O
is O
primarily O
alpha-helical O
and O
mediates O
subunit O
dimerization O
and, O
presumably, O
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA B-Chemical
binding. O
Molecular O
modeling O
studies O
in O
which O
L-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA B-Chemical
was O
docked O
into O
the O
enzyme-NAD+ O
complex O
suggest O
that O
His O
158 O
serves O
as O
a O
general O
base, O
abstracting O
a O
proton O
from O
the O
3-OH O
group O
of O
the O
substrate. O
Furthermore, O
the O
ability O
of O
His O
158 O
to O
perform O
such O
a O
function O
may O
be O
enhanced O
by O
an O
electrostatic O
interaction O
with O
Glu O
170, O
consistent O
with O
previous O
biochemical O
observations. O
These O
studies O
provide O
further O
understanding O
of O
the O
molecular O
basis O
of O
several O
inherited B-Disease
metabolic I-Disease
disease I-Disease
states O
correlated O
with O
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA B-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiencies. O
