# Abstract
The O
branched-chain B-Chemical
organic I-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
3-methylglutaconic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
is O
an O
intermediate O
(as O
the O
CoA B-Chemical
thioester) O
in O
the O
leucine B-Chemical
degradative O
pathway O
as O
well O
as O
the O
mevalonate B-Chemical
shunt, O
a O
pathway O
that O
links O
isoprenoid B-Chemical
metabolism O
with O
mitochondrial O
acetyl-CoA B-Chemical
metabolism. O
Because O
the O
majority O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
abnormal O
3-methylglutaconic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
or O
acidemia B-Disease
appear O
to O
have O
normal O
leucine B-Chemical
metabolism, O
we O
have O
speculated O
that O
some O
patients B-Species
with O
3-methylglutaconic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
may O
have O
defects O
of O
polyisoprenoid B-Chemical
or O
sterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
leading O
to O
overflow O
of O
isoprenoid B-Chemical
precursors O
to O
3-methylglutaconate B-Chemical
via O
the O
mevalonate B-Chemical
shunt. O
We O
therefore O
measured O
plasma O
levels O
of O
3-methylglutaconic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
in O
patients B-Species
with O
a O
known O
defect O
of O
sterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
Smith-Lemli-Opitz B-Disease
syndrome, I-Disease
and O
found O
that O
the O
patients B-Species
with O
the O
lowest O
cholesterol B-Chemical
levels O
had O
abnormally O
increased O
plasma O
levels O
of O
3-methylglutaconic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
similar O
in O
magnitude O
to O
those O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
idiopathic O
3-methylglutaconic B-Disease
aciduria. I-Disease
This O
finding O
suggests O
that O
some O
patients B-Species
with O
unexplained O
3-methylglutaconic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
may O
have O
defects O
of O
isoprenoid B-Chemical
or O
sterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
underlying O
their O
abnormal O
organic B-Disease
aciduria. I-Disease
