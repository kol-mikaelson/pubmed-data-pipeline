# Abstract
Pravastatin, B-Chemical
one O
of O
the O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme B-Gene
A I-Gene
(HMG-CoA) I-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors O
(statins) O
widely O
used O
in O
the O
management O
of O
hypercholesterolaemia, B-Disease
has O
unique O
pharmacokinetic O
characteristics O
among O
the O
members O
of O
this O
class. O
Many O
in O
vivo O
and O
in O
vitro O
human B-Species
and O
animal O
studies O
suggest O
that O
active O
transport O
mechanisms O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
pravastatin. B-Chemical
The O
oral O
bioavailability O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
is O
low O
because O
of O
incomplete O
absorption O
and O
a O
first-pass O
effect. O
The O
drug O
is O
rapidly O
absorbed O
from O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
the O
small O
intestine, O
probably O
via O
proton-coupled O
carrier-mediated O
transport, O
and O
then O
taken O
up O
by O
the O
liver O
by O
a O
sodium-independent O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporter. O
About O
half O
of O
the O
pravastatin B-Chemical
that O
reaches O
the O
liver O
via O
the O
portal O
vein O
is O
extracted O
by O
the O
liver, O
and O
this O
hepatic O
extraction O
is O
mainly O
attributed O
to O
biliary O
excretion O
which O
is O
performed O
by O
a O
primary O
active O
transport O
mechanism. O
The O
major O
metabolites O
are O
produced O
by O
chemical O
degradation O
in O
the O
stomach O
rather O
than O
by O
cytochrome O
P450-dependent O
metabolism O
in O
the O
liver. O
The O
intact O
drug O
and O
its O
metabolites O
are O
cleared O
through O
both O
hepatic O
and O
renal O
routes, O
and O
tubular O
secretion O
is O
a O
predominant O
mechanism O
in O
renal O
excretion. O
The O
dual O
routes O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
elimination O
reduce O
the O
need O
for O
dosage O
adjustment O
if O
the O
function O
of O
either O
the O
liver O
or O
kidney O
is O
impaired, O
and O
also O
reduce O
the O
possibility O
of O
drug O
interactions O
compared O
with O
other O
statins. O
which O
are O
largely O
eliminated O
by O
metabolism. O
The O
lower O
protein O
binding O
than O
other O
statins O
weakens O
the O
tendency O
for O
displacement O
of O
highly O
protein-bound O
drugs. O
Although O
all O
statins O
show O
a O
hepatoselective O
disposition, O
the O
mechanism O
for O
pravastatin B-Chemical
is O
different O
from O
that O
of O
the O
others. O
There O
is O
high O
uptake O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
by O
the O
liver O
via O
an O
active O
transport O
mechanism, O
but O
not O
by O
other O
tissues O
because O
of O
its O
hydrophilicity, O
whereas O
the O
disposition O
characteristics O
of O
other O
statins O
result O
from O
high O
hepatic O
extraction O
because O
of O
high O
lipophilicity. O
These O
pharmacokinetic O
properties O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
may O
be O
the O
result O
of O
the O
drug O
being O
given O
in O
the O
pharmacologically O
active O
open O
hydroxy B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
form O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
its O
hydrophilicity O
is O
markedly O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
other O
statins. O
The O
nature O
of O
the O
pravastatin B-Chemical
transporters, O
particularly O
in O
humans, B-Species
remains O
unknown O
at O
present. O
Further O
mechanistic O
studies O
are O
required O
to O
establish O
the O
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic O
relationships O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
and O
to O
provide O
the O
optimal O
therapeutic O
efficacy O
for O
various O
types O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
hypercholesterolaemia. B-Disease
