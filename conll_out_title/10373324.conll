# Abstract
The O
gene O
for O
maleylacetoacetate B-Gene
isomerase I-Gene
(MAAI) B-Gene
(EC O
5.2.1.2) O
was O
the O
last O
gene O
in O
the O
mammalian O
phenylalanine B-ProteinMutation
tyrosine I-ProteinMutation
catabolic O
pathway O
to O
be O
cloned. O
We O
have O
isolated O
the O
human B-Species
and O
murine B-Species
genes O
and O
determined O
their O
genomic O
structure. O
The O
human B-Species
gene O
spans O
a O
genomic O
region O
of O
approximately O
10 O
kb, O
has O
9 O
exons O
ranging O
from O
50 O
to O
528 O
bp O
in O
size, O
and O
was O
mapped O
to O
14q24.3-14q31.1 O
using O
fluorescence O
in O
situ O
hybridization. O
The O
complete O
catabolic O
pathway O
of O
phenylalanine B-ProteinMutation
tyrosine I-ProteinMutation
is O
normally O
restricted O
to O
liver O
and O
kidney, O
but O
the O
maleylacetoacetate B-Gene
isomerase I-Gene
gene O
is O
expressed O
ubiquitously. O
This O
suggests O
a O
possible O
second O
role O
for O
the O
MAAI B-Gene
protein O
different O
from O
phenylalanine B-ProteinMutation
tyrosine I-ProteinMutation
catabolism. O
We O
have O
searched O
for O
mutations O
in O
the O
maleylacetoacetate B-Gene
isomerase I-Gene
gene O
in O
four O
cases O
of O
unexplained O
severe O
liver B-Disease
failure I-Disease
in O
infancy O
with O
clinical O
similarities O
to O
hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia I-Disease
type I-Disease
I I-Disease
(pseudotyrosinemia). B-Disease
Several O
amino O
acid O
changes O
were O
identified, O
but O
all O
were O
found O
to O
retain O
MAAI B-Gene
activity O
and O
thus O
represent O
protein O
polymorphisms. O
We O
conclude O
that O
MAAI B-Gene
deficiency O
is O
not O
a O
common O
cause O
of O
the O
pseudotyrosinemic O
phenotype. O
