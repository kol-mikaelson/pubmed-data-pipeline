# Abstract
The O
biosynthesis O
of O
CoA B-Chemical
from O
pantothenic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(vitamin B-Chemical
B5) I-Chemical
is O
an O
essential O
universal O
pathway O
in O
prokaryotes O
and O
eukaryotes. O
The O
CoA B-Chemical
biosynthetic O
genes O
in O
bacteria O
have O
all O
recently O
been O
identified, O
but O
their O
counterparts O
in O
humans B-Species
and O
other O
eukaryotes O
remained O
mostly O
unknown. O
Using O
comparative O
genomics, O
we O
have O
identified O
human B-Species
genes O
encoding O
the O
last O
four O
enzymatic O
steps O
in O
CoA B-Chemical
biosynthesis: O
phosphopantothenoylcysteine B-Gene
synthetase I-Gene
(EC O
), O
phosphopantothenoylcysteine B-Gene
decarboxylase I-Gene
(EC O
), O
phosphopantetheine O
adenylyltransferase O
(EC O
), O
and O
dephospho-CoA O
kinase O
(EC O
). O
Biological O
functions O
of O
these O
human B-Species
genes O
were O
verified O
using O
a O
complementation O
system O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
based O
on O
transposon O
mutagenesis. O
The O
individual O
human B-Species
enzymes O
were O
overexpressed O
in O
E. B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
purified, O
and O
the O
corresponding O
activities O
were O
experimentally O
verified. O
In O
addition, O
the O
entire O
pathway O
from O
phosphopantothenate B-Chemical
to O
CoA B-Chemical
was O
successfully O
reconstituted O
in O
vitro O
using O
a O
mixture O
of O
purified O
recombinant O
enzymes. O
Human B-Species
recombinant O
bifunctional O
phosphopantetheine O
adenylyltransferase O
dephospho-CoA O
kinase O
was O
kinetically O
characterized. O
This O
enzyme O
was O
previously O
suggested O
as O
a O
point O
of O
CoA B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
regulation, O
and O
we O
have O
observed O
significant O
differences O
in O
mRNA O
levels O
of O
the O
corresponding O
human B-Species
gene O
