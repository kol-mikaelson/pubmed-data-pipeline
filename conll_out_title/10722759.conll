# Abstract
The O
de O
novo O
pathway O
of O
sphingolipid B-Chemical
synthesis O
has O
been O
identified O
recently O
as O
a O
novel O
means O
of O
generating O
ceramide B-Chemical
during O
apoptosis. O
Furthermore, O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
activation O
of O
dihydroceramide O
synthase O
is O
responsible O
for O
increased O
ceramide B-Chemical
production O
through O
this O
pathway. O
In O
this O
study, O
accumulation O
of O
ceramide B-Chemical
mass O
in O
Molt-4 B-CellLine
human B-Species
leukemia B-Disease
cells O
by O
the O
chemotherapy O
agent O
etoposide B-Chemical
was O
found O
to O
occur O
primarily O
due O
to O
activation O
of O
the O
de O
novo O
pathway. O
However, O
when O
the O
cells O
were O
labeled O
with O
a O
substrate O
for O
dihydroceramide O
synthase O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
etoposide, B-Chemical
there O
was O
no O
corresponding O
increase O
in O
labeled O
ceramide. B-Chemical
Further O
investigation O
using O
a O
labeled O
substrate O
for O
serine O
palmitoyltransferase, O
the O
rate-limiting O
enzyme O
in O
the O
pathway, O
resulted O
in O
an O
accumulation O
of O
label O
in O
ceramide B-Chemical
upon O
etoposide B-Chemical
treatment. O
This O
result O
suggests O
that O
the O
activation O
of O
serine O
palmitoyltransferase O
is O
the O
event O
responsible O
for O
increased O
ceramide B-Chemical
generation O
during O
de O
novo O
synthesis O
initiated O
by O
etoposide. B-Chemical
Importantly, O
the O
ceramide B-Chemical
generated O
from O
de O
novo O
synthesis O
appears O
to O
have O
a O
distinct O
function O
from O
that O
induced O
by O
sphingomyelinase O
action O
in O
that O
it O
is O
not O
involved O
in O
caspase-induced O
poly B-Gene
(ADP-ribose)polymerase I-Gene
proteolysis O
but O
does O
play O
a O
role O
in O
disrupting O
membrane O
integrity O
in O
this O
model O
system. O
These O
results O
implicate O
serine O
palmitoyltransferase O
as O
the O
enzyme O
controlling O
de O
novo O
ceramide B-Chemical
synthesis O
during O
apoptosis O
and O
begin O
to O
define O
a O
unique O
function O
of O
ceramide B-Chemical
generated O
from O
this O
pathway. O
