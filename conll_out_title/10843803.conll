# Abstract
The O
glycine B-Gene
N-methyltransferase I-Gene
(GNMT) B-Gene
gene O
encodes O
a O
protein O
that O
not O
only O
acts O
as O
an O
enzyme O
to O
regulate O
the O
ratio O
of O
S-adenosylmethionine B-Chemical
to O
S-adenosylhomocysteine, B-Chemical
but O
also O
participates O
in O
the O
detoxification O
pathway O
in O
liver O
cells. O
Previously, O
we O
reported O
that O
the O
expression O
level O
of O
GNMT B-Gene
was O
diminished O
in O
human B-Species
hepatocellular B-Disease
carcinoma. I-Disease
In O
this O
study, O
the O
human B-Species
GNMT B-Gene
gene O
was O
cloned O
and O
characterized. O
It O
contains O
six O
exons O
and O
spans O
about O
10 O
kb. O
Instead O
of O
a O
TATA O
box, O
it O
has O
a O
transcriptional O
initiator O
located O
801 O
bp O
upstream O
from O
the O
translation O
start O
codon. O
The O
gene O
was O
localized O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
6p12 I-Chromosome
using O
fluorescence O
in O
situ O
hybridization. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
of O
16 O
tissues O
from O
different O
human B-Species
organs O
showed O
that O
GNMT B-Gene
was O
expressed O
only O
in O
liver, O
pancreas, O
and O
prostate. O
