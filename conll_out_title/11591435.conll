# Abstract
Phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
a O
methyl-branched B-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
present O
in O
the O
human B-Species
diet. O
Due O
to O
its O
structure, O
degradation O
by O
beta-oxidation O
is O
impossible. O
Instead, O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
oxidized O
by O
alpha-oxidation, O
yielding O
pristanic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Despite O
many O
efforts O
to O
elucidate O
the O
alpha-oxidation O
pathway, O
it O
remained O
unknown O
for O
more O
than O
30 O
years. O
In O
recent O
years, O
the O
mechanism O
of O
alpha-oxidation O
as O
well O
as O
the O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
the O
process O
have O
been O
elucidated. O
The O
process O
was O
found O
to O
involve O
activation, O
followed O
by O
hydroxylase, O
lyase O
and O
dehydrogenase O
reactions. O
Part, O
if O
not O
all O
of O
the O
reactions O
were O
found O
to O
take O
place O
in O
peroxisomes. O
The O
final O
product O
of O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
alpha-oxidation O
is O
pristanic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
This O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
degraded O
by O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation. O
After O
3 O
steps O
of O
beta-oxidation O
in O
the O
peroxisome, O
the O
product O
is O
esterified O
to O
carnitine B-Chemical
and O
shuttled O
to O
the O
mitochondrion O
for O
further O
oxidation. O
Several O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
with O
one O
or O
more O
deficiencies O
in O
the O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
pristanic B-Chemical
degradation O
have O
been O
described. O
The O
clinical O
expressions O
of O
these O
disorders O
are O
heterogeneous, O
and O
vary O
between O
severe O
neonatal O
and O
often O
fatal O
symptoms O
and O
milder O
syndromes O
with O
late O
onset. O
Biochemically, O
these O
disorders O
are O
characterized O
by O
accumulation O
of O
phytanic B-Chemical
and O
or O
pristanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
in O
tissues O
and O
body O
fluids. O
Several O
of O
the O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
involving O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
or O
pristanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism O
have O
been O
characterized O
on O
the O
molecular O
level. O
