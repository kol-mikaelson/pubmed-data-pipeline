# Abstract
Mitochondrial O

beta-oxidation O
was O
studied O
by O
incubating O
stable O
isotope-labeled O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
probes O
with O
human B-Species
fibroblasts O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
L-carnitine. B-Chemical
The O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
intermediates O
produced O
were O
analyzed O
by O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry. O
Oxidation O
by O
normal O
fibroblasts O
produced O
specific O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
intermediates O
corresponding O
to O
acyl-CoA O
dehydrogenase O
substrates O
mainly O
of O
10 O
or O
less O
carbons. O
These O
probes O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
pathway, O
involving O
all O
beta-oxidative O
steps, O
could O
be O
examined. O

Increased O
amounts O
of O
octanoyl-, B-Chemical

detected. O
The O
ratios O
of O
octanoylcarnitine B-Chemical
to O
decanoyl- B-Chemical
or I-Chemical
decenoylcarnitine B-Chemical
appear O
specific O
for O
MCAD B-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
Even O

elevated O
in O
incubations O

MCAD-deficient B-Disease
cells O
with O
labeled O
linoleate B-Chemical
or O
with O
a O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
mixture O
which O
included O
palmitate, B-Chemical
oleate, B-Chemical
and O
linoleate, B-Chemical
the O
predominant O
intermediate O
was O
octanoylcarnitines. B-Chemical
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
MCAD-deficient B-Disease
cells O
readily O
convert O
decanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
into O
octanoyl-CoA. B-Chemical
This O

system O
could O
be O
utilized O
to O
study O
fatty B-Chemical

and O
to O

origins O
of O
metabolic O
intermediates O
associated O
with O
them. O
