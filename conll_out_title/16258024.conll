# Abstract
Atorvastatin B-Chemical
(ATV) B-Chemical
is O
primarily O
metabolized O
by O
CYP3A B-Gene
in O
the O
liver O
to O
form O
two O
active O
hydroxy O
metabolites. O
Therefore, O
the O
sequential O
transport O
system O
governed O
by O
hepatic O
uptake O
and O
efflux O
transporters O
is O
important O
for O
the O
drug O
disposition O
and O
metabolism. O
Here, O
we O
assessed O
the O
interaction O
of O
ATV B-Chemical
with O
hepatic O
uptake O
transporter O
organic O
anion O
transporting O
polypeptide O
(Oatp) O
and O
efflux O
transporter O
multidrug O
resistance O
associated O
protein O
2 O
(MRP2 B-Gene
Mrp2) B-Gene
in O
vitro O
and O
ex O
situ O
using O
the O
isolated O
perfused O
rat B-Species
liver O
(IPRL). O
Rifampicin B-Chemical
(RIF) B-Chemical
was O
chosen O
as O
an O
inhibitor O
for O
Oatp O
in O
both O
uptake O
and O
IPRL O
studies. O
Its O
inhibitory O
effects O
on O
MRP2 B-Gene
and O
metabolism O
were O
also O
tested O
using O
MRP2-overexpressing O
cells O
and O
rat B-Species
microsomes, O
respectively. O
Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
RIF B-Chemical
effectively O
inhibits O
the O
Oatp-mediated O
uptake O
of O
ATV B-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolites. O
Inhibition O
on O
MRP2-mediated O
efflux O
of O
ATV B-Chemical
was O
also O
observed O
at O
a O
high O
RIF B-Chemical
concentration. O
Compared O
with O
ATV B-Chemical
alone O
in O
the O
IPRL, O
the O
area O
under O
the O
curve(s) O
(AUC) O
of O
ATV B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
increased O
by O
RIF, B-Chemical
whereas O
the O
AUC O
of O
both O
metabolites O
were O
also O
increased O
in O
a O
concentration-dependent O
manner. O
However, O
the O
extent O
of O
metabolism O
was O
significantly O
reduced, O
as O
reflected O
by O
the O
reduced O
amounts O
of O
metabolites O
detected O
in O
RIF-treated O
livers. O
In O
conclusion, O
inhibition O
of O
Oatp-mediated O
uptake O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
major O
determinant O
for O
interaction O
between O
ATV B-Chemical
and O
RIF. B-Chemical
Metabolites O
of O
ATV B-Chemical
were O
subject O
to O
Oatp-mediated O
uptake O
as O
well, O
suggesting O
that O
they O
undergo O
a O
similar O
disposition O
pathway O
as O
the O
parent O
drug. O
These O
data O
emphasize O
the O
relevance O
of O
uptake O
transporter O
as O
being O
one O
of O
the O
major O
players O
in O
hepatic O
drug O
elimination, O
even O
for O
substrates O
that O
undergo O
metabolism. O
