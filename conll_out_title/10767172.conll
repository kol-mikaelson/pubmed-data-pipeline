# Abstract
Dimethylglycine B-Chemical
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(DMGDH; B-Gene
E.C. O
1.5.99.2) O
is O
an O
enzyme O
involved O
in O
the O
catabolism O
of O
choline, B-Chemical
catalyzing O
the O
oxidative O
demethylation O
of O
dimethylglycine B-Chemical
(DMG) B-Chemical
to O
form O
sarcosine. B-Chemical
Subsequently, O
sarcosine B-Chemical
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(SDH; B-Gene
E.C. O
1.5.99.1) O
converts O
sarcosine B-Chemical
to O
glycine B-Chemical
via O
a O
similar O
reaction. O
Both O
enzymes O
are O
found O
as O
monomers O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix, O
and O
both O
contain O
1 O
mol O
of O
covalently O
bound O
flavin B-Chemical
adenine I-Chemical
dinucleotide. I-Chemical
DMGDH B-Gene
and O
SDH B-Gene
also O
utilize O
a O
noncovalently O
bound O
folate B-Chemical
coenzyme O
that O
receives O
the O
"1-carbon" O
groups O
that O
are O
removed O
by O
DMGDH B-Gene
and O
SDH, B-Gene
forming O
"active O
formaldehyde." B-Chemical
We O
have O
recently O
described O
a O
new O
inborn B-Disease
error I-Disease
of I-Disease
metabolism I-Disease
of O
DMGDH B-Gene
characterized O
by O
an O
unusual O
fish-like O
body O
odor. O
To O
augment O
our O
study O
of O
this O
new O
disorder, O
we O
have O
isolated O
two O
human B-Species
genomic O
clones O
that O
together O
contain O
16 O
exons O
of O
coding O
sequence O
for O
the O
hDMGDH O
gene. O
Fluorescent O
in O
situ O
hybridization O
analysis O
of O
the O
hDMGDH O
gene O
indicates O
that O
it O
is O
found O
on O
chromosome O
5q12.2-q12.3. O
In O
addition, O
several O
polymorphisms O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
the O
hDMGDH O
cDNA O
sequence. O
Population O
analysis O
of O
two O
Ser O
Pro O
polymorphisms O
found O
367 O
amino O
acids O
apart O
reveals O
a O
skew O
of O
alleles, O
with O
the O
haplotypes O
Ser O
Pro O
or O
Pro O
Ser O
(79%) O
overrepresented O
compared O
to O
the O
number O
of O

or O
Pro O

observed. O
Possible O
functional O
consequences O
of O
these O
findings O
are O
discussed. O
Characterization O
of O
the O
gene O
structure O
for O
hDMGDH O
will O
aid O
in O
the O
study O

enzyme. O
