# Abstract
The O
first O
two O
steps O
in O
the O
mammalian O
lysine-degradation O
pathway O
are O
catalyzed O
by O
lysine-ketoglutarate O
reductase O
and O
saccharopine O
dehydrogenase, O
respectively, O
resulting O
in O
the O
conversion O
of O
lysine B-Chemical
to O
alpha-aminoadipic B-Chemical
semialdehyde. I-Chemical
Defects O
in O
one O
or O
both O
of O
these O
activities O
result O
in O
familial B-Disease
hyperlysinemia, B-Disease
an O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
condition I-Disease
characterized O
by O
hyperlysinemia, B-Disease
lysinuria, B-Disease
and O
variable O
saccharopinuria. B-Disease
In O
yeast, B-Species
lysine-ketoglutarate O
reductase O
and O
saccharopine O
dehydrogenase O
are O
encoded O
by O
the O
LYS1 B-Gene
and O
LYS9 B-Gene
genes, O
respectively, O
and O
we O
searched O
the O
available O
sequence O
databases O
for O
their O
human B-Species
homologues. O
We O
identified O
a O
single O
cDNA O
that O
encoded O
an O
apparently O
bifunctional O
protein, O
with O
the O
N-terminal O
half O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
yeast B-Species
LYS1 B-Gene
and O
with O
the O
C-terminal O
half O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
yeast B-Species
LYS9. B-Gene
This O
bifunctional O
protein O
has O
previously O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
"alpha-aminoadipic B-Chemical
semialdehyde I-Chemical
synthase," O
and O
we O
have O
tentatively O
designated O
this O
gene O
"AASS." B-Gene
The O
AASS B-Gene
cDNA O
contains O
an O
open O
reading O
frame O
of O
2,781 O
bp O
predicted O
to O
encode O
a O
927-amino-acid-long O
protein. O
The O
gene O
has O
been O
sequenced O
and O
contains O
24 O
exons O
scattered O
over O
68 O
kb O
and O
maps O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
7q31.3. I-Chromosome
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
revealed O
the O
presence O
of O
several O
transcripts O
in O
all O
tissues O
examined, O
with O
the O
highest O
expression O
occurring O
in O
the O
liver. O
We O
sequenced O
the O
genomic O
DNA O
from O
a O
single O
patient B-Species
with O
hyperlysinemia B-Disease
(JJa). B-Disease
The O
patient B-Species
is O
the O
product O
of O
a O
consanguineous O
mating O
and O
is O
homozygous O
for O
an O
out-of-frame O
9-bp O
deletion O
in O
exon O
15, O
which O
results O
in O
a O
premature O
stop B-ProteinMutation
codon I-ProteinMutation
at I-ProteinMutation
position I-ProteinMutation
534 I-ProteinMutation
of O
the O
protein. O
On O
the O
basis O
of O
these O
and O
other O
results, O
we O
propose O
that O
AASS B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
first O
two O
steps O
of O
the O
major O
lysine-degradation O
pathway O
in O
human B-Species
cells O
and O
that O
inactivating O
mutations O
in O
the O
AASS B-Gene
gene O
are O
a O
cause O
of O
hyperlysinemia. B-Disease
