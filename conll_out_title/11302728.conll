# Abstract
We O
report O
the O
cloning, O
characterization, O
and O
chromosomal O
localization O
of O
two O
novel O
human B-Species
members O
of O
the O
bicarbonate O

BTR1 B-Gene
(Bicarbonate B-Gene
Transporter I-Gene
Related I-Gene
protein-1) I-Gene
and O
AE4 B-Gene
(Anion B-Gene
Exchange I-Gene
protein I-Gene
4). I-Gene
BTR1 B-Gene
is O
a O
novel O
mammalian O
protein. O
The O
BTR1 B-Gene
gene O
maps O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
20p12 I-Chromosome
and O
encodes O
a O
100 O

protein O
predominantly O
expressed O
in O
the O
kidney, O
salivary O
glands, O
testis, O
thyroid O
glands, O
and O
trachea. O
The O
AE4 B-Gene
gene O
maps O
to O
chromosome O
5q23-31 O
and O
encodes O
a O
104 O

expressed O
mainly O
in O
the O
