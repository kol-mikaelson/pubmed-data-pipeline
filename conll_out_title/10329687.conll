# Abstract
We O
have O
cloned O
the O
human B-Species
Na+-dependent B-Gene
multivitamin I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
(SMVT), B-Gene
which O
transports O
the O
water-soluble O
vitamins O
pantothenate, B-Chemical
biotin, B-Chemical
and O
lipoate, B-Chemical
from O
a O
placental O
choriocarcinoma B-Disease
cell O
line O
(JAR). B-CellLine
The O
cDNA O
codes O
for O
a O
protein O
of O
635 O
amino O
acids O
with O
12 O
transmembrane O
domains O
and O
4 O
putative O
sites O
for O
N-linked O
glycosylation. O
The O
human B-Species
SMVT B-Gene
exhibits O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
homology O
(84% O
identity O
and O
89% O
similarity) O
to O
the O
rat B-Species
counterpart. O
When O
expressed O
in O
HRPE B-CellLine
cells, O
the O
cDNA-induced O
transport O
process O
is O
obligatorily O
dependent O
on O
Na+ O
and O
accepts O
pantothenate, B-Chemical
biotin, B-Chemical
and O
lipoate B-Chemical
as O
substrates. O
The O
relationship O
between O
the O
cDNA-specific O
uptake O
rate O
of O
pantothenate B-Chemical
or O
biotin B-Chemical
and O
Na+ O
concentration O
is O
sigmoidal O

The O
human B-Species
SMVT, B-Gene
when O

in O
the O
presence O
of O
pantothenate, B-Chemical
biotin, B-Chemical
and O
lipoate B-Chemical
in O
a O

potential-dependent O
manner. O
We O

on O
the O
structural O
organization O
and O
chromosomal O

of O
the O
human B-Species
SMVT B-Gene
gene. O
The O
SMVT B-Gene
gene O
is O
approximately O
14 O
kilobase O

and O
consists O
of O
17 O
exons. O
The O
SMVT B-Gene

is O
located O
on O
chromosome O
2p23 O
as O
