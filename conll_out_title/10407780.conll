# Abstract
In O
recent O
years O
tremendous O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
enzymology O
of O
the O
mitochondrial O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation O
machinery O
and O
defects O
therein. O
Firstly, O
a O
number O
of O
new O
mitochondrial O
beta-oxidation O
enzymes O
have O
been O
identified, O
including O
very-long-chain B-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(VLCAD) B-Gene
and O
mitochondrial B-Gene
trifunctional I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(MTP). B-Gene
Secondly, O
the O
introduction O
of O
tandem O
MS O
for O
the O
analysis O
of O
plasma O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
has O
greatly O
facilitated O
the O
identification O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
a O
defect O
in O
fatty B-Disease
acid I-Disease
oxidation I-Disease
(FAO). B-Disease
These O
two O
developments O
explain O
why O
the O
number O
of O
defined O
FAO B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
has O
increased O
dramatically, O
making O
FAO B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
the O
most O
rapidly O
growing O
group O
of O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
of I-Disease
metabolism. I-Disease
In O
this O
review O
we O
describe O
the O
current O
state O
of O
knowledge O
of O
the O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
oxidation O
of O
straight-chain, B-Chemical
branched-chain I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
(poly)unsaturated I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acyl-CoAs I-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
disorders O
of O
fatty B-Disease
acid I-Disease
oxidation. I-Disease
The O
laboratory O
diagnosis O
of O
these O
disorders O
is O
described, O
with O
particular O
emphasis O
on O
the O
methods O
used O
to O
identify O
the O
underlying O
enzyme O
defect O
and O
the O
molecular O
mutations. O
In O
addition, O
a O
simple O
flowchart O
is O
presented O
as O
a O
guide O
to O
the O
identification O
of B-Disease
mitochondrial I-Disease
FAO-disorders. O
Finally, O
treatment O
strategies O
are O
discussed O
briefly. O
