# Abstract
Based O
on O
the O
sequences O
of O
the O
highly O
conserved O
segments O
in O
the O
previously O
cloned O
sialyltransferases, O
a O
cDNA O
encoding O
Galbeta1, B-Gene
3GalNAc I-Gene
alpha2,3-sialyltransferase I-Gene
(SIATFL) B-Gene
has O
been O
isolated O
from O
human B-Species
fetal O
liver. O
Expression O
analysis O
of O
the O
gene O
has O
been O
performed O
with O
various O
carcinoma B-Disease
cell O
lines, O
fetal O
tissues, O
fetal O
and O
adult O
liver O
and O
both O
hepatoma B-Disease
and O
the O
surrounding O
tissue O
from O
the O
same O
liver. O
The O
SIATFL B-Gene
gene O
was O
expressed O
poorly O
in O
fetal O
liver O
and O
in O
adult O
liver, O
slightly O
in O
hepatoma B-Disease
and O
highly O
in O
the O
surrounding O
tissue O
of O
hepatoma. B-Disease
The O
cDNA O
encoding O
the O
putative O
active O
domain O
was O
expressed O
in O
COS-1, B-CellLine
Escherichia B-Species
coli, I-Species
and O
Pichia B-Species
pastoris. I-Species
The O
recombinant O
protein O
expressed O
in O
COS-1 B-CellLine
could O
catalyse O
the O
transfer O
of O
NeuAc B-Chemical
from O
CMP-NeuAc O
to O
asialo-fetuin. O
No O
enzyme O
activity O
was O
detected O
with O
a O
32-kDa O
protein O
in O
E. O
coli O
and O
both O
32-kDa O
and O
41-kDa O
proteins O
in O
P. O
pastoris. O
These O
results O
suggested O
that O
correct O
glycosylation O
of O
the O
enzyme O
might O
play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
its O
folding O
that O
may O
be O
directly O
related O
to O
the O
enzymatic O
activity. O
