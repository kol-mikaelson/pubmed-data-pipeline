The O

The O

are O
hetero(di)mers O
composed O
of O
a O
catalytic O

the O

The O

of O
LAT1 B-Gene
suggests O
that O

involved O
mainly O
in O
transporting O
amino O

into O
growing O

and O
across O
some O
endothelial O

whereas O
the O

of O
LAT2 B-Gene
indicates O
that O

is O
mainly O
involved O
in O
the O

However, O
