The O

the O

of O
three O
potential O

the O
dipeptides B-Chemical
L-alanyl-L-tyrosine B-Chemical
(Ala-Tyr) B-Chemical
and O
glycyl-L-tyrosine B-Chemical
(Gly-Tyr), B-Chemical
and O
N-acetyl-L-tyrosine B-Chemical
(Nac-Tyr) B-Chemical

evaluated O
in O
six O
patients B-Species

hepatic B-Disease

(five O

and O
seven O

subjects. O
In O
controls, O
whole-body O

Ala-Tyr B-Chemical

Both O
dipeptides B-Chemical

In O
hepatic B-Disease

elimination O
and O
hydrolysis O
of O
Ala-Tyr B-Chemical
and O
Gly-Tyr B-Chemical
were O
comparable O
to O

Neither O

The O

conclude O
that O

does O
not O
affect O
elimination O

hydrolysis O

the O
dipeptides B-Chemical
Ala-Tyr B-Chemical

Gly-Tyr B-Chemical

the O

Nac-Tyr B-Chemical

was O
not O
grossly O
affected O
by O
hepatic B-Disease

neither O
in O

subjects O
nor O
in O
hepatic B-Disease

patients B-Species
was O
an O

Both O
dipeptides B-Chemical
but O
not O
Nac-Tyr B-Chemical
may O
serve O
as O
a O
tyrosine B-Chemical
source O
in O
parenteral O
nutrition. O
Moreover, O
by O
its O
rapid O
hydrolysis, O
the O
use O
of O
Ala-Tyr, B-Chemical
for O
the O

time, O
enables O
a O
