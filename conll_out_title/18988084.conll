# Abstract
1. O
The O
effects O
of O
adjuvant-induced O
arthritis B-Disease
on O
the O
chiral O
inversion O
of O
'profens', O
a O
type O
of O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drug, O
have O
hardly O
been O
investigated. O
The O
authors O
investigated O
the O
effects O
of O
adjuvant-induced O
arthritis B-Disease
on O
the O
chiral O
inversion O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
using O
freshly O
isolated O
rat B-Species
hepatocytes. O
2. O
S- B-Chemical
or O
R-ibuprofen B-Chemical
was O
incubated O
with O
hepatocytes O
isolated O
from O
control O
and O
adjuvant-induced O
arthritis B-Disease
rats B-Species
in O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
serum. O
In O
the O

system O
the O
chiral O

S-ibuprofen I-Chemical
and O
the O

rate O
constants O
of O
both O
enantiomers O
in O
adjuvant-induced O
arthritis B-Disease
rats B-Species
were O
significantly O
decreased O

about O
64-80% O
of O
the O

In O
contrast, O
the O

resulted O
in O

3. O
With O
regard O
to O

enzymes, O
adjuvant-induced O
arthritis B-Disease
decreased O

4. O
Chiral O
inversion O
of O

S-ibuprofen I-Chemical
was O
inhibited O
by O

5. O
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
adjuvant-induced O

induces O
down-regulation O
