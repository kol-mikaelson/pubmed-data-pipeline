# Abstract
To O
understand O
the O
interactions O
and O
functional O
role O
of O
each O
of O
the O
three O
mitochondrial O
NAD(+)-dependent O
isocitrate O
dehydrogenase O
(IDH) O
subunits O
(alpha, O
beta, O
and O
gamma), O
we O
have O
characterized O
human B-Species
cDNAs O
encoding O
two O
beta O
isoforms O
(beta(1) B-Gene
and I-Gene
beta(2)) B-Gene
and O
the O
gamma O
subunit. O
Analysis O
of O
deduced O
amino O
acid O
sequences O
revealed O
that O
beta(1) B-Gene
and I-Gene
beta(2) B-Gene
encode O
349 O
and O
354 O
amino O
acids, O
respectively, O
and O
the O
two O
isoforms O
only O
differ O
in O
the O
most O
carboxyl O
28 O
amino O
acids. O
The O
gamma O
cDNA O
encodes O
354 O
amino O
acids O
and O
is O
almost O
identical O
to O
monkey O
IDHgamma. B-Gene
Northern O
analyses O
revealed O
that O
the O
smaller O
beta(2) B-Gene
transcript O
(1.3 O
kilobases) O
is O
primarily O
expressed O
in O
heart O
and O
skeletal O
muscle, O
whereas O
the O
larger O
beta(1) B-Gene
mRNA O
(1.6 O
kilobases) O
is O
prevalent O
in O
nonmuscle O
tissues. O
Sequence O
analysis O
of O
the O
IDHbeta O
gene O
indicates O
that O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
C-terminal O
28 O
amino O
acids O
between O
beta(1) B-Gene
and I-Gene
beta(2) B-Gene
proteins O
results O
from O
alternative O
splicing O
of O
a O
single O
transcript. O
Among O
the O
various O
combinations O
of O
human B-Species
IDH O
subunits O
co-expressed O
in O
bacteria, O
alphabetagamma, O
alphabeta, B-Gene
and O
alphagamma O
combinations O
exhibited O
significant O
amounts O
of O
IDH O
activity, O
whereas O
subunits O
produced O
alone O
and O
betagamma O
showed O
no O
detectable O
activity. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
alpha O
is O
the O
catalytic O
subunit O
and O
that O
at O
least O
one O
of O
the O
other O
two O
subunits O
plays O
an O
essential O
supporting O
role O
for O
activity. O
Substitution O
of O
beta(1) B-Gene
with O
beta(2) B-Gene
in O
the O
co-expression O
system O
lowered O
the O
pH O
optimum O
for O
IDH O
activity O
from O
8.0 O
to O
7.6. O
This O
difference O
in O
optimal O
pH O
was O
analogous O
to O
what O
was O
observed O
in O
mouse B-Species
kidney O
and O
brain O
(beta(1) B-Gene
prevalent; O
optimal O
pH O
8.0) O
versus O
heart O
(beta(2) B-Gene
prevalent; O
pH O
7.6) O
mitochondria. O
Experiments O
with O
a O
specially O
designed O
splicing O
reporter O
construct O
stably O
transfected O
into O
HT1080 O
cells O
indicate O
that O
acidic O
conditions O
favor O
a O
splicing O
pattern O
responsible O
for O
the O
muscle- O
and O
heart-specific O
beta(2) B-Gene
isoform. O
Taken O
together, O
these O
data O
indicate O
a O
regulatory O
role O
of O
IDHbeta O
isoforms O
in O
determining O
the O
pH O
optimum O
for O
IDH O
activity O
through O
the O
tissue-specific O
alternative O
splicing. O
