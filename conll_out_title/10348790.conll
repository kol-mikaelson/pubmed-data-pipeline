# Abstract
Tacrolimus B-Chemical
is O
a O
macrolide B-Chemical
lactone I-Chemical
with O
potent O
immunosuppressive O
properties. O
It O
has O
been O
shown O
in O
clinical O
studies O
to O
prevent O
allograft O
rejection. O
The O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
in O
healthy O
subjects O
and O
transplant O
patients B-Species
has O
been O
described O
in O
earlier O
studies O
using O
immunoassay O
methods; O
however, O
detailed O
information O
on O
the O
absorption, O
distribution, O
metabolism, O
and O
excretion O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
using O
a O
radiolabeled O
drug O
is O
lacking. O
The O
objective O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
characterize O
the O
disposition O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
after O
single O
i.v. O
(0.01 O
mg O
kg) O
and O
oral O
(0.05 O
mg O
kg) O
administration O
of O
14C-labeled O
drug O
in O
six O
healthy O
subjects. O
Tacrolimus B-Chemical
was O
absorbed O
rapidly O
after O
oral O
dosing O
with O
a O
mean O
Cmax O
and O
Tmax O
of O
42 O
ng O
ml O
and O
1 O
h, O
respectively. O
The O
oral O
bioavailability O
was O
about O
20%. O
After O
i.v. O
and O
oral O
dosing, O
most O
of O
the O
administered O
dose O
was O
recovered O
in O
feces, O
suggesting O
that O
bile O
is O
the O
principal O
route O
of O
elimination. O
Urinary O
excretion O
accounted O
for O
less O
than O
3% O
of O
total O
administered O
dose. O
In O
systemic O
circulation, O
unchanged O
parent O
compound O
accounted O
for O
nearly O
all O
the O
radioactivity; O
however, O
less O
than O
0.5% O
of O
unchanged O
drug O
was O
detectable O
in O
feces O
and O
urine. O
The O
excretion O
of O
the O
metabolites O
was O
formation-rate-limited. O
The O
mean O
total O
body O
clearance O
at O
37.5 O
ml O
min O
was O
equivalent O
to O
about O
3% O
of O
the O
liver O
blood O
flow. O
Renal O
clearance O
was O
less O
than O
1% O
of O
the O
total O
body O
clearance. O
The O
mean O
elimination O
half-life O
was O
44 O
h. O
