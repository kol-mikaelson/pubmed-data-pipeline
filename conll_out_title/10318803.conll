# Abstract
We O
previously O
demonstrated O
a O
unique O
alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase O
that O
transferred O
N-acetylgalactosamine B-Chemical
(GalNAc) B-Chemical
to O
the O
tetrasaccharide-serine, B-Chemical
GlcAbeta1-3Galbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Xylbeta1-O-Ser O
(GlcA B-Chemical
represents O
glucuronic B-Chemical
acid), I-Chemical
derived O
from O
the O
common O
glycosaminoglycan-protein O
linkage O
region, O
through O
an O
alpha1,4-linkage. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
purified O
the O
enzyme O
from O
the O
serum-free O
culture O
medium O
of O
a O
human B-Species
sarcoma B-Disease
cell O
line. O
Peptide O
sequence O
analysis O
of O
the O
purified O
enzyme O
revealed O
100% O
identity O
to O
the O
multiple O

gene O
EXTL2 B-Gene
EXTR2, B-Gene
a O
member O
of O
the O
hereditary O
multiple O
exostoses O
(EXT) O
gene O
family O
of O
tumor B-Disease
suppressors. O
The O
expression O
of O
a O
soluble O
recombinant O
form O
of O
the O
protein O
produced O
an O
active O
enzyme, O
which O
transferred O
alpha-GalNAc B-Chemical
from O
UDP-[3H]GalNAc B-Chemical
to O
various O
acceptor O
substrates O
including O
GlcAbeta1-3Galbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Xylbeta1-O-Ser. O
Interestingly, O
the O
enzyme O
also O
catalyzed O
the O
transfer O
of O
N-acetylglucosamine B-Chemical
(GlcNAc) B-Chemical
from O
UDP-[3H]GlcNAc B-Chemical
to O
GlcAbeta1-3Galbeta1-O-naphthalenemethanol, B-Chemical
which O
was O
the O
acceptor O
substrate O
for O
the O
previously O
described O
GlcNAc B-Chemical
transferase O
I O
involved O
in O
the O
biosynthetic O
initiation O
of O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate. I-Chemical
The O
GlcNAc B-Chemical
transferase O
reaction O
product O
was O
sensitive O
to O
the O
action O
of O
heparitinase O
I, O
establishing O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
enzyme O
to O
be O
alpha1, O
4-GlcNAc O
transferase. O
These O
results O
altogether O
indicate O
that O
EXTL2 B-Gene
EXTR2 B-Gene
encodes O
the O
alpha1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase O
that O
transfers O
GalNAc B-Chemical
GlcNAc B-Chemical
to O
the O
tetrasaccharide B-Chemical
representing O
the O
common O
glycosaminoglycan-protein O
linkage O
region O
and O
that O
is O
most O
likely O
the O
critical O
enzyme O
that O
determines O
and O
initiates O
the O
heparin B-Chemical

separating O
it O
