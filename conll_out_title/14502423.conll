# Abstract
ASCT1 B-Gene
is O
a O
member O
of O
the O
glutamate O
transporter O
superfamily O
cloned O
from O
human B-Species
brain O
and O
characterized O
as O
a O
Na(+)-dependent O
neutral O
amino-acid O
exchanger, O
which O
displays O
substrate-induced O
chloride-channel O
activity O
and O
mediates O
concentrative O
transport O
of O
alanine. B-Chemical
Initial O
studies O
in O
ASCT1-expressing O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
showed O
that O
proline B-Chemical
did O
not O
elicit O
measurable O
currents, O
in O
contrast O
to O
what O
occurred O
with O
alanine, B-Chemical
serine B-Chemical
or O
cysteine, B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
proline B-Chemical
was O
not O
an O
ASCT1 B-Gene
substrate, O
although O
it O
induced O
the O
release O
of O
alanine B-Chemical
from O
preloaded O
oocytes. O
Here, O
we O
have O
studied O
the O
uptake O
of O
proline B-Chemical
and O
hydroxyproline B-Chemical
by O
ASCT1-expressing O
oocytes O
in O
order O
to O
investigate O
the O
ability O
of O
ASCT1 B-Gene
to O
translocate O
these O
imino B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
The O
results O
demonstrate O
ASCT1-mediated O
proline B-Chemical
transport O
that O
is O
Na(+)-dependent, O
saturable, O
inhibited O
by O
the O
reported O
ASCT1 B-Gene
substrates O
as O
well O
as O
by O
hydroxyproline B-Chemical
and O
can O
drive O
the O
imino B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
against O
its O
concentration O
gradient. O
The O
apparent O
kinetic O
constants O
for O
the O
transport O
of O
alanine B-Chemical
and O
the O
imino B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
obtained O
with O
oocytes O
from O
the O
same O
batch, O
showed O
maximal O
transport O
rate O
for O
proline B-Chemical
and O
hydroxyproline B-Chemical
to O
be O
half O
of O
that O
for O
alanine. B-Chemical
However, O
K(0.5) O
for O
proline B-Chemical
was O
704 O
+ O
- O
86 O
microM, O
about O
three O
times O
higher O
than O
alanine B-Chemical
K(0.5) O
(203.3 O
+ O
- O
36.4 O
microM), O
whereas O
hydroxyproline B-Chemical
K(0.5) O
was O
33.2 O
+ O
- O
4.3 O
microM, O
indicating O
that O
the O
hydroxylation O
on O
carbon O
4 O
of O
proline B-Chemical
strongly O
increases O
the O
affinity O
of O
ASCT1 B-Gene
for O
this O
proline B-Chemical
derivative. O
In O
summary, O
the O
present O
work O
demonstrates O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
ability O
of O
ASCT1 B-Gene
to O
transport O
proline B-Chemical
and O
hydroxyproline. B-Chemical
