# Abstract
Recently, O
a O
P-type O
ATPase O
was O
cloned O
from O
bovine B-Species
chromaffin O
granules O
(b-ATPase O
II) O
and O
a O
mouse B-Species
teratocarcinoma B-Disease
cell O
line O
(m-ATPase O
II) O
and O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
homologous O
to O
the O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
DRS2 B-Gene
gene, O
the O
inactivation O
of O
which O
resulted O
in O
defective O
transport O
of O
phosphatidylserine. B-Chemical
Here, O
we O
report O
the O
cloning O
from O
a O
human B-Species
skeletal O

cDNA O
library O
of O
a O
human B-Species
ATPase B-Gene

orthologous O

presumed O
bovine B-Species

mouse B-Species

(95.3 O
and O
95.9% O

respectively). O
Compared O
with O
the O
bovine B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
counterparts, O
the O
cloned O
h-ATPase O
II O
polypeptide O
exhibits O
a O
similar O
membrane O

but O
contains O
15 O
additional O
amino O

(1163 O
vs O
1148) O
located O
in O
the O
second O
intracytoplasmic O
loop, O
near O
the O
DKTGTLT-phosphorylation O
site. O
However, O
RT-PCR O
analysis O
performed O
with O
RNA O
from O
different O
human B-Species
tissues O
and O
cell O
lines O
revealed O
that O
the O
coding O
sequence O
for O
these O
15 O
residues O
is O
sometimes O
present O
and O
sometimes O
absent, O
most O
likely O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
tissue-specific O
alternative O

event. O
The O
h-ATPase O
II O
gene, O
which O
was O
mapped O
to O
chromosome O
4p14-p12, O
is O
expressed O
as O
a O
9.5-kb O
RNA O
species O

a O
large O
variety O
of O
tissues, O
but O
was O
not O
detected O
in O
liver, O
testis, O

placenta, O
nor O
in O
the O
erythroleukemic O
cell O
line O
K562. O
