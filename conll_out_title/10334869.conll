# Abstract
We O
have O
cloned O
a O
Na+-dependent B-Gene
multivitamin I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
from O
rabbit B-Species
intestine O
(riSMVT). O
The O
cDNA O
codes O
for O
a O
protein O
of O
636 O
amino O
acids O
with O
12 O
putative O
transmembrane O
domains. O
When O
expressed O
in O
mammalian O
cells, O
the O
cDNA O
induces O
Na+-dependent O
uptake O
of O
the O
vitamins O
pantothenate B-Chemical
and O
biotin. B-Chemical
Lipoate B-Chemical
is O
also O
a O
substrate O
for O
the O
cDNA-induced O
uptake O
process. O
The O
affinity O
constant O
for O
the O
cDNA-specific O
transport O
of O
pantothenate B-Chemical
and O
biotin B-Chemical
is O
approximately O
2 O
and O
approximately O
8 O
microM, O
respectively. O
The O
Na+:vitamin O
stoichiometry O
is O
greater O
than O
1, O
indicating O
that O
the O
transport O
process O
is O
electrogenic. O
The O
SMVT-specific O
transcripts O
of O
3.2 O
kbp O
are O
equally O
distributed O
throughout O
the O
small O
intestine. O
We O
have O
also O
cloned O
SMVT B-Gene
from O
the O
human B-Species
intestinal O
cell O
line O
Caco-2. B-CellLine
The O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
SMVT B-Gene
cDNA O
codes O
for O
a O
protein O
of O
635 O
amino O
acids O
which O
is O
homologous O
to O
riSMVT O
and O
is O
identical O
to O
the O
SMVT B-Gene
expressed O
in O
the O
human B-Species
choriocarcinoma B-Disease
cell O
line O
JAR. B-CellLine
Caco-2 B-CellLine
SMVT B-Gene
also O
catalyzes O
Na+-dependent O
uptake O
of O
pantothenate, B-Chemical
biotin, B-Chemical
and O
lipoate. B-Chemical
In O
