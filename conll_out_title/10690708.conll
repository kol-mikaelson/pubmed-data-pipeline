# Abstract
We O
examined O
the O
developmental O
changes O
in O
activities O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
epoxidase, O
and O
vitamin B-Chemical
K-2,3-epoxide I-Chemical
reductase O
and O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
reductase O
in O
the O
human B-Species
autopsied O
liver. O
The O
activity O
of O
epoxidase, O
which O
converts O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
hydroquinone I-Chemical
to O
its O
epoxide, B-Chemical
showed O
a O
high O
value O
in O
the O
early O
prenatal O
period O
of O
10-30 O
gestational O
weeks O
but O
decreased O
rather O
rapidly O
in O
contrast O
with O
the O
reductase O
activities. O
After O
birth, O
a O
significant O
decrease O
of O
the O
epoxidase O
activity O
was O
observed O
but O
no O
such O
change O
was O
seen O
during O
the O
postnatal O
period. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
activities O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
K-2,3-epoxide I-Chemical
reductase O
and O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
reductase, O
which O
convert O
vitamin B-Chemical
K-2,3-epoxide I-Chemical
to O
its O
hydroquinone, O
showed O
a O
significantly O
low O
value O
in O
the O
early O
prenatal O
period. O
The O
highest O
activity O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
epoxidase O
in O
the O
early O
prenatal O
period O
may O
be O
essential O
to O
the O
production O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
dependent O
ligands O
for O
growth O
factors O
expressed O
in O
the O
embryo. O
