# Abstract
Tacrolimus B-Chemical
(FK506), B-Chemical
an O
immunosuppressive O
drug, O
is O
co-medicated O
with O
multiple O
drugs O
under O
clinical O
conditions. O
Tacrolimus B-Chemical
is O
highly O
lipophilic O
and O
is O
excreted O
from O
the O
body O
after O
receiving O
extensive O
metabolism. O
Due O
to O
its O
narrow O
therapeutic O
window O
following O
organ O
transplantation, O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
requires O
therapeutic O
drug O
monitoring O
by O
an O
enzyme O
immunoassay O
using O
the O
monoclonal O
antibody O
raised O
against O
tacrolimus. B-Chemical
Therefore, O
metabolism O
studies O
including O
drug-drug O
interaction O
and O
metabolite O
identification O
studies O
are O
essential O
for O
the O
efficient O
development O
and O
clinically O
optimal O
usage O
of O
this O
drug. O
Tacrolimus B-Chemical
was O
metabolized O
by O
the O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) I-Gene
3A I-Gene
subfamily. O
Metabolic O
drug-drug O
interaction O
studies O
were O
conducted O
to O
provide O
information O
regarding O
the O
optimal O
usage O
of O
tacrolimus, B-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolism O
was O
inhibited O
by O
known O
CYP3A B-Gene
inhibitors O
such O
as O
ketoconazole, B-Chemical
cyclosporine B-Chemical
A, I-Chemical
and O
nifedipine. B-Chemical
Recent O
reports O
on O
clinical O
pharmacokinetics O
indicate O
that O
dose O
levels O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
need O
to O
be O
adjusted O
in O
transplant O
patients B-Species
with O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
polymorphism. O
