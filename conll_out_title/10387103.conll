# Abstract
Deoxycytidine B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
(dCK) B-Gene
is O
an O
enzyme O
with O
broad O
substrate O
specificity O
which O
can O
phosphorylate O
pyrimidine B-Chemical
and O
purine B-Chemical
deoxynucleosides, B-Chemical
including O
important O
antiviral O
and O
cytostatic O
agents. O
In O
this O
study, O
stopped-flow O
experiments O
were O
used O
to O
monitor O
intrinsic O
fluorescence O
changes O
induced O
upon O
binding O
of O
various O
phosphate B-Chemical
donors O
(ATP, B-Chemical
UTP, B-Chemical
and O
the O
nonhydrolyzable O
analogue O
AMP-PNP) B-Chemical
and O
the O
acceptor O
dCyd B-Chemical

recombinant O
dCK. B-Gene
Monophasic O

were O
observed O
throughout. O
The O
nucleotides O
as O

to O
the O
enzyme O
by O
a O
two-step O
mechanism, O
involving O
a O
rapid O
initial O

step, O
followed O
by O
a O
protein O
conformational O

that O

for O
the O

lower O
than O
those O
for O
dCyd B-Chemical

[(1.3-1.5 O

This O
difference O
most O

is O
due O
predominantly O
to O
the O
large O

in O
the O

of O
the O

(0.04-0.26 O

Whereas O
the O

the O
binding O
of O
ATP, B-Chemical
UTP, B-Chemical
and O
AMP-PNP B-Chemical
to O
dCK B-Gene
showed O
some O
differences, O
UTP B-Chemical
exhibiting O
the O
tightest O
binding, O
no O
significant O
differences O
were O
observed O
for O
the O
binding O
of O
dCyd B-Chemical
to O
dCK B-Gene
in O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
phosphate B-Chemical
donors. O
However, O
the O
binding O
of O
dCyd B-Chemical
to O
dCK B-Gene
in O
the O
presence O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
or O
UTP B-Chemical
was O
accompanied O
by O
a O
1.5- O
or O
3-fold O
higher O
quenching O
amplitude O
as O
compared O
with O
dCyd B-Chemical
alone O
or O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
AMP-PNP. B-Chemical
We O
conclude O
that O
ATP B-Chemical
and O
UTP B-Chemical
induce O
a O
conformational O
change O
in O
the O
enzyme, O
thereby O
enabling O
efficient O
phosphoryl O
transfer. O
