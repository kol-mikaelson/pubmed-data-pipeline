# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Methacrylyl-coenzyme O
A O
(MC-CoA) O
hydratase O
and O
beta-hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme O
A O
(HIB-CoA) O
hydrolase O
are O
key O
enzymes O
regulating O
the O
toxic O
concentration O
of O
MC-CoA O
generated O
in O
valine B-Chemical
catabolism. O
MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
We O
studied O
the O
activities O
and O
mRNA O
expression O
levels O
of O
these O
enzymes O
in O
normal O
human B-Species
livers O
and O
in O
human B-Species
livers O
with O
chronic B-Disease
hepatitis, I-Disease
cirrhosis, B-Disease
or O
hepatocellular B-Disease
carcinoma. I-Disease
RESULTS: O
The O
activities O
of O
both O
enzymes O
were O
significantly O
lower O
by O
36% O
to O
46% O
in O
livers O
with O
cirrhosis B-Disease
or O
hepatocellular B-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
compared O
with O
normals, O
suggesting O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
capability O
of O
detoxifying O
MC-CoA O
with O
these O
diseases. O
The O
mRNA O
levels O
for O
both O
enzymes O
measured O
by O
quantitative O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
were O
significantly O
increased O
in O
livers O
with O
cirrhosis, B-Disease
but O
were O
not O
altered O
in O
those O
with O
chronic B-Disease
hepatitis I-Disease
or O
hepatocellular B-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
when O
compared O
with O
normal O
livers. O
CONCLUSION: O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
low O
levels O
of O
these O
enzyme O
activities O
in O
livers O
with O
cirrhosis B-Disease
or O
hepatocellular B-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
are O
the O
result O
of O
posttranscriptional O
regulation O
in O
the O
damaged O
liver. O
