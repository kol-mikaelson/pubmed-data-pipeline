# Abstract
Recently, O
the O
PAT O
family O
of O
proton-dependent O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
has O
been O
identified O
as O
a O
novel O
class O
of O
mammalian B-Species
amino O
acid O
symporters. O
PAT1 B-Gene
and O
PAT2 B-Gene
members O
mediate O
electrogenic O
uptake O
of O
small, O
neutral O
amino O
acids O
and O
derivatives O
by O
cotransport O
of O
protons. O
Analysis O
of O
the O
structural O
requirements O
for O
substrate O
recognition O
by O
PAT1 B-Gene
identified O
that O
a O
free O
amino O
group O
in O
a O
substrate O
is O
not O
essential O
for O
recognition. O
We O
therefore O
hypothesized O
that O
PAT1 B-Gene
and O
its O
ortholog O
PAT2 B-Gene
may O
also O
be O
able O
to O
recognize O
and O
transport O
the O
homologous O
short-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(SCFAs) B-Chemical
such O
as O
acetate, B-Chemical
propionate, B-Chemical
and O
butyrate. B-Chemical
We O
examined O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
whether O
the O
SCFAs B-Chemical
interact O
with O
the O
transporter O
by O
employing O
flux O
studies, O
electrophysiology O
and O
intracellular O
pH O
recordings. O
SCFAs B-Chemical
did O
not O
induce O
positive O
inward O
currents O
but O
inhibited O
glycine-induced O
transport O
currents. O
PAT-mediated O
uptake O
of O
radiolabeled O
proline B-Chemical
was O
also O
dose-dependently O
reduced O
by O
SCFA B-Chemical
and O
could O
be O
described O
by O
first O

with O

significantly O
enhanced O
in O
oocytes O
expressing O
PAT1 B-Gene
or O
PAT2. B-Gene
An O

demonstrated O

intracellular O
pH O

the O
initial O
intracellular O
acidification O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
SCFAs B-Chemical
significantly O
increased O
in O
PAT-expressing O
oocytes. O
In O
conclusion, O
our O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
PAT1 B-Gene
and O
PAT2 B-Gene
proteins O
are O
capable O
to O
transport O
selected O
SCFAs B-Chemical
in O
an O
electroneutral O
and O
the O
homologous O
amino O

in O
an O
electrogenic O
mode O
and O
are O
therefore O
a O
paradigm O
for O
bifunctional O
solute O
carriers. O
