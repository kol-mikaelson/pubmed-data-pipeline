# Abstract
sn-Glycerol-3-phosphate O
dehydrogenase O
(GlpD) O
from O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
is O
a O
peripheral O
membrane O
enzyme O
involved O
in O
respiratory O
electron O
transfer. O
For O
it O
to O
display O
its O
enzymic O
activity, O
binding O
to O
the O
inner O
membrane O
is O
required. O
The O
way O
the O
enzyme O
interacts O
with O
the O
membrane O
and O
how O
this O
controls O
activity O
has O
not O
been O
elucidated. O
In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
provide O
evidence O
for O
direct O
protein-lipid O
interaction. O
Using O
the O
monolayer O
technique, O
we O
observed O
insertion O
of O
GlpD O
into O
lipid B-Chemical
monolayers O
with O
a O
clear O
preference O
for O
anionic O
phospholipids. B-Chemical
GlpD O
variants O
with O
point O
mutations O
in O
their O
predicted O
amphipathic O
helices O
showed O
a O
decreased O
ability O
to O
penetrate O
anionic O
phospholipid O
monolayers. O
From O
these O
data O
we O
propose O
that O
membrane O
binding O
of O
GlpD O
occurs O
by O
insertion O
of O
an O
amphipathic O
helix O
into O
the O
acyl-chain O
region O
of O
lipids O
mediated O
by O
negatively O
charged O
phospholipids. B-Chemical
