# Abstract
Based O
on O
a O
detailed O
sequence O
of O
the O
distal O
Down B-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
critical I-Disease
region I-Disease
(DSCR), B-Disease
we O
predicted O
and O
molecularly O
cloned O
a O
novel O
gene, O
designated O
DSCR5. B-Gene
We O
determined O
the O
sequences O
of O
expressed O
sequence O
tags O
(ESTs) O
that O
almost O
matched O
the O
predicted O
cDNA O
sequence O
of O
DSCR5. B-Gene
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
showed O
that O
DSCR5 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
several O
tissues O
including O
the O
liver, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
heart, O
pancreas O
and O
testis. O
To O
determine O
the O
5'-end O
of O
DSCR5, B-Gene
the O
oligo-capping O
method O
was O
employed. O
Combining O
the O
EST O
sequence O
data O
and O
that O
from O
the O
oligo-capping O
experiments, O
we O
obtained O
the O
full-length O
cDNA O
sequence O
of O
DSCR5. B-Gene
DSCR5 B-Gene
had O
at O
least O
four O
types O
of O
alternatively O
spliced O
variants. O
According O
to O
the O
number O
of O
exons, O
they O
could O
be O
classified O
into O
two O
subtypes: O
DSCR5alpha O
and O
DSCR5beta. O
DSCR5alpha O
includes O
three O
splice O
variant O
subtypes, O
DSCR5alpha1, O
alpha2 O
and O
alpha3, O
which O
each O
has O
different O
first O
non-coding O
exon. O
In O
addition, O
the O
most O
abundantly O
isolated O
form, O
DSCR5alpha1, O
shows O
microheterogeneity O
of O
the O
mRNA O
start O
site. O
Comparison O
of O
the O
sequences O
between O
the O
predicted O
cDNA O
and O
the O
molecularly O
cloned O
cDNA O
revealed O
that O
the O
computer O
programs O
had O
limited O
validity O
to O
correctly O
predict O
the O
terminal O
exons. O
Thus, O
molecular O
cloning O
should O
always O
be O
required O
to O
complement O
the O
inadequacy O
of O
the O
computer O
predictions. O
