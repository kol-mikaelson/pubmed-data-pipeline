# Abstract
Using O
a O
two-step O
screening O
system O
for O
genes O
involved O
in O

[Kataoka O

163(2) O
(2001) O

we O
identified O
a O
cDNA O
whose O
expression O
level O
was O
higher O
in O
mouse B-Species
placenta O
at O
later O
stages O
of O
gestation O
and O
in O
sublines O
of O
cancer B-Disease
cells O
with O
low O
degrees O
of O
invasiveness. O
The O
deduced O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
showed O
relatively O
high O
similarity O
with O
beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase2 O
approximately O
5 O
(beta3GnT2 O
approximately O
5), O
and O
the O
protein O
was O
therefore O
named O
beta3GnT7. B-Gene
A O
possible O
human B-Species
ortholog O
was O
identified O
and O
its O
chromosomal O
locus O
was O
determined O
to O
be O
2q37.1. B-Chromosome
In O
the O
mouse, B-Species
beta3GnT7 B-Gene
was O
most O
strongly O
expressed O
in O
the O
placenta O
and O
colon. O
Moderate O
amounts O
of O
mRNA O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
lung, O
stomach, O
small O
intestine, O
and O
kidney. O
The O
expression O
of O
beta3GnT7 B-Gene
was O
very O
weak O
in O
the O
cerebrum, O
cerebellum, O
heart, O
and O
testis. O
Transfection O
of O
the O
antisense O
oligonucleotide B-Chemical
significantly O
enhanced O
the O
motility O
of O
a O
lung B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
cell O
line O
(KLN205-MUC1) O
in O
a O
monolayer O
compared O
to O
the O
controls. O
Furthermore, O
the O
antisense O
oligonucleotide B-Chemical
increased O
the O
number O
of O
cells O
that O
invaded O
the O
matrix-coated O
membrane O
in O
an O
in O
vitro O
invasion O
model. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
beta3GnT7 B-Gene
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
preventing O
cells O
from O
migrating O
out O
of O
the O
original O
tissues O
and O
invading O
surrounding O
tissues. O
