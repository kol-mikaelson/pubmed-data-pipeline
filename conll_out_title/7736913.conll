# Abstract
Losartan B-Chemical
is O
a O
4-chloro-5-hydroxymethylimidazole B-Chemical
derivative O
that O
is O
a O
potent O
and O
highly O
selective O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
antagonist. O
Losartan B-Chemical
is O
metabolized O
in O
vivo O
in O
rats, B-Species
monkeys, B-Species
and O
humans B-Species
to O
a O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
derivative I-Chemical
E3174 B-Chemical
that O
is O
pharmacologically O
more O
active O
than O
the O
parent O
compound. O
We O
have O
investigated O
the O
mechanism O
of O
this O
biotransformation O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
preparations. O
The O
oxidation O
of O
both O
losartan B-Chemical
and O
the O
putative O
aldehyde B-Chemical
intermediate O
E3179 B-Chemical
was O
catalyzed O
by O
the O
microsomal O
fraction, O
required O
both O
NADPH B-Chemical
and O

and O
was O
inhibited O
by O
SKF B-Chemical
525-A, I-Chemical
implicating O
cytochrome O
P450 O
(CYP). O
When O
incubations O
with O

18O2, B-Chemical
the O
extent O

18O B-Chemical
incorporation O
into O
the O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
product O
was O
consistent O
with O
a O
mechanism O
for O
losartan B-Chemical
oxidation O
involving O
an O
aldehyde B-Chemical
intermediate. O
To O
substantiate O
the O
involvement O
of O
CYP O
in O
these O
reactions, O
incubations O
with O
losartan B-Chemical
and O
the O
aldehyde B-Chemical
E3179 B-Chemical
were O
performed O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
isoform-selective O
inhibitors. O
Inhibitors O
of O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
5 I-Gene
(gestodene B-Chemical
and O
ketoconazole) B-Chemical

CYP2C9 B-Gene
10 I-Gene
(sulfaphenazole) B-Chemical
attenuated O
the O
oxidation O
of O
both O
substrates. O
It O
was O
then O
demonstrated O
that O
microsomes O
containing O
either O
recombinant O
human B-Species
liver O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
or O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
were O
capable O
of O
oxidizing O
both O
losartan B-Chemical
and O
the O
aldehyde B-Chemical
E3179 B-Chemical
to O
the O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
E3174. B-Chemical
Subsequently, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
rabbit O
anti-CYP2C9 O
and O
anti-CYP3A3 O
4 O
inhibited O
the O
oxidation O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
to O
E3174 B-Chemical
in O
incubations O
with O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes. O
These O
studies O
support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O
aldehyde B-Chemical
E3179 B-Chemical
is O
an O
intermediate O
in O
the O
oxidation O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
and O
that O
this O
two-step O
reaction O
is O
catalyzed O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
by O
members O
of O
the O
CYP3A B-Gene
and O
CYP2C B-Gene
subfamilies. O
