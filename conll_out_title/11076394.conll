# Abstract
The O
liver O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
detoxification O
of O
xenobiotics. O
Recently, O
many O
secondary O
active O
transporters O
responsible O
for O
sinusoidal O
drug O
uptake O
have O
been O
cloned O
and O
their O
transport O
properties O
have O
been O
determined. O
These O
include O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
Na(+)-taurocholate O
cotransporting O
polypeptides, O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
organic O
anion O
transporting O
polypeptides, O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
prostaglandin O
transporters, O
rat B-Species
organic O
anion O
transporters, O
and O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
organic O
cation O
transporters. O
In O
addition, O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
multi-drug O

3, O
a O
primary O
active O
transporter O
responsible O
for O
the O
cellular O
extrusion O
of O
organic O
anions, O

the O
sinusoidal O
membrane O
is O
induced O
under O
cholestatic O
conditions. O
In O
this O
article, O
drug O
transport O

the O
sinusoidal O

is O
summarized, O
particularly O
focusing O
on O
the O
molecular O
mechanism O
of O
transport. O
