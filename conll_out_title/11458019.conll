# Abstract
Both O
glutamine B-Chemical
and O
glucose B-Chemical
are O
highly O
utilized O
by O
the O
small O
intestine O
in O
various O
animal O
species. O
They O
are, O
however, O
very O
partially O
oxidized, O
the O
major O
known O
fate O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
being O
lactate B-Chemical
and O
alanine, B-Chemical
and O
that O
of O
glutamine B-Chemical
being O
citrulline B-Chemical
or O
proline. B-Chemical
At O
variance O
with O
the O
current O
view O
that O
only O
the O
liver O
and O
kidney O
are O
gluconeogenic O
organs, O
because O
both O
are O
the O
only O
tissues O
to O
express O
the O
glucose-6 B-Gene
phosphatase I-Gene
gene, O
this O
gene O
is O
also O
expressed O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
in O
rats B-Species
and O
humans, B-Species
and O
is O
strongly O
induced O
in O
insulinopenic B-Disease
states, O
such O
as O
fasting O
and O
diabetes. B-Disease
Under O
the O
latter O
conditions, O
the O
small O
intestine O
contributes O
20-25% O
of O
whole-body O
endogenous O
glucose B-Chemical
production. O
The O
main O
small O
intestine O
gluconeogenic O
substrate O
is O
glutamine B-Chemical
and, O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent, O
glycerol. B-Chemical
Accounting O
for O
these O
fluxes, O
the O
phosphoenolpyruvate B-Gene
carboxykinase I-Gene
gene O
is O
strongly O
induced O
in O
insulinopenia B-Disease
and, O
although O
up O
to O
now O
it O
had O
been O
considered O
absent O
from O
this O
tissue, O
the O
glycerokinase B-Gene
gene O
is O
expressed O
in O
the O
small O
intestine. O
The O
production O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
by O
the O
small O
intestine O
may O
be O
acutely O
blunted O
upon O
insulin B-Gene
infusion. O
These O
new O
data O
also O
emphasize O
the O
central O
role O
of O
alanine B-Gene
aminotransferase I-Gene
in O
the O
coupling O
of O
glutamine B-Chemical
and O
glucose B-Chemical
metabolisms O
in O
the O
small O
intestine. O
