# Abstract
Very-long-chain O
acyl-CoA O
dehydrogenase O
(VLCAD) B-Gene
is O
an O
enzyme O
catalyzing O
the O
dehydrogenation O
of O
long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
in O
the O
first O
step O
of O
mitochondrial O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation. O
Using O
an O
ETF B-Gene
(electron O
transfer O
flavoprotein, O
the O
physiological O
electron O

of O
VLCAD) B-Gene
reduction O
assay, O
we O
identified O
VLCAD B-Gene
deficiency I-Disease
in O
cultured O

or O
liver O
tissue O
from O
30 O
patients B-Species
in O
27 O
families. O
They O
clinically O
presented O
two O
phenotypes: O
a O
'severe' O
presentation O
characterized O
by O
an O
early O
onset O
of O
symptoms, O
with O
hypertrophic B-Disease
cardiomyopathy B-Disease
and O
a O
high O
incidence O
of O
death, B-Disease
and O
a O
'mild' O
form O
with O
hypoketotic B-Disease
hypoglycaemia, I-Disease

Cells O
isolated O
from O
patients B-Species
who O
develop O
cardiomyopathy B-Disease
characteristically O
accumulate O
longer-chain O

acylcarnitines B-Chemical
(hexadecanoylcarnitine B-Chemical
and O
tetradecanoylcarnitine) B-Chemical
when O
incubated O
with O
palmitate. B-Chemical
However, O
cells O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
the O
hypoglycaemic B-Disease
presentation O
produced O
relatively O
shorter-chain-length O
intermediates O
(mainly O
dodecanoylcarnitine). B-Chemical
Inhibition O
of O
carnitine O
palmitoyl O
transferase O
I, O
in O
vitro, O
eliminated O
these O
intermediates O
with O
cells O
from O
both O
phenotypes O
indicating O
their O
intramitochondrial O
origin. O
Although O
the O
explanation O
for O
these O
distinct O
biochemical O
findings O
is O
not O
obvious, O
the O
correlation O
with O
the O
two O
phenotypes O
provides O
an O
opportunity O
for O
accurate O
prognosis O
and O
early O
implementation O
of O
appropriate O
treatment. O
Prenatal O
diagnosis O
of O
this O
life-threatening O
disorder O
was O
successfully O
performed O
in O
seven O
pregnancies O
in O
six O
of O
those O
families O
by O
assay O
of O
trophoblasts O
or O
amniocytes. O
In O
an O
at O
risk O
family, O
diagnosis O
of O
an O
affected O
fetus O
by O
measurement O
of O
VLCAD B-Gene
activity O
in O
noncultured O
chorionic O

allowed O
termination O
of O
