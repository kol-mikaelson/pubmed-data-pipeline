# Abstract
Nucleotides O
are O
important O
extracellular O
signaling O
molecules. O
At O
least O
five O
mammalian O
P2Y O
receptors O
exist O
that O
are O
specifically O
activated O
by O
ATP, B-Chemical
UTP, B-Chemical
ADP, B-Chemical
or O
UDP. B-Chemical
Although O
the O
existence O
of O
ectoenzymes O
that O
metabolize O
extracellular O
nucleotides O
is O
well O
established, O
the O
relative O
flux O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
and O
UTP B-Chemical
through O
their O
extracellular O
metabolic O
products O
remains O
undefined. O
Therefore, O
we O
have O
studied O
the O
kinetics O
of O
accumulation O
and O
metabolism O
of O
endogenous O
ATP B-Chemical
in O
the O
extracellular O
medium O
of O
four O
different O
cell O
lines. O
ATP B-Chemical
concentrations O
reached O
a O
maximum O
immediately O
after O
change O
of O
medium O
and O
decreased O
thereafter O
with O
a O
single O
exponential O
decay O
(t(1 O

approximately;230-40 O
min). O
ATP B-Chemical
levels O
did O
not O
fall O
to O
zero O
but O
attained O
a O
base-line O
concentration O
that O
was O
independent O
of O
the O
medium O
volume O
and O
of O
the O
initial O
ATP B-Chemical
concentration. O
Although O
the O
base-line O
concentration O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
remained O
stable O
for O
up O
to O
12 O

[gamma-(32)P]ATP B-Chemical
added O

resting O
cells O
as O
a O
radiotracer O
was O
completely O

indicating O
that O
steady O
state O
reflected O
a O

High O
performance O
liquid O

analysis O
revealed O
that O
the O
gamma-phosphate O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
was O
rapidly, O
although O
transiently, O
transferred O
during O
steady O
state O
to O
species O
subsequently O
identified O
as O
UTP B-Chemical
and O
GTP, B-Chemical
indicating O
the O
existence O
of O
both O
ecto-nucleoside O
diphosphokinase O
activity O
and O
the O
accumulation O
of O
endogenous O
UDP B-Chemical
and O
GDP. B-Chemical
Conversely, O
addition O
of O
[gamma-(32)P]UTP B-Chemical
to O
resting O
cells O
resulted O
in O
transient O
formation O
of O
[gamma-(32)P]ATP, B-Chemical
indicating O
phosphorylation O
of O
endogenous O
ADP B-Chemical
by O
nucleoside O
diphosphokinase. O
The O
final O
(32)P-products O
of O
[gamma-(32)P]ATP B-Chemical
metabolism O
were O
[(32)P]orthophosphoric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
a O
(32)P-labeled O
species O
that O
was O
further O
purified O
and O
identified O
as O
[(32)P]inorganic B-Chemical
pyrophosphate. I-Chemical
In O
C6 B-CellLine
cells, O
the O
formation O
of O
[(32)P]pyrophosphate B-Chemical
from O
[gamma-(32)P]ATP B-Chemical
at O
steady O
state O
exceeded O
by O
3-fold O
that O
of O
[(32)P]orthophosphate. O
These O
results O
illustrate O
for O
the O
first O
time O
a O
constitutive O
release O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
and O
other O
nucleotides O
and O
reveal O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
complex O
extracellular O
metabolic O
pathway O
for O
released O
nucleotides. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
existence O
of O
an O
ecto-ATPase O
activity, O
our O
results O
suggest O
a O
major O
scavenger O
role O
of O
ecto-ATP O
pyrophosphatase O
and O
a O
transphosphorylating O

nucleoside O
diphosphokinase. O
