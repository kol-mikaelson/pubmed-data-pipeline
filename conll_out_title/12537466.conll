# Abstract
Raisins O
are O
dried O
grapes O
that O
are O
popular O
shelf-stable O
snacks. O
Three O
commercially O
important O
types O
of O
raisins O
were O
studied: O
sun-dried O
(natural), O
artificially O
dried O
(dipped), O
and O
sulfur O
dioxide-treated O
(golden) O
raisins. O
Dietary B-Chemical
fiber I-Chemical
composition O
was O
analyzed O
by O
AACC O
method O
32-25. O
Polysaccharides B-Chemical
were O
hydrolyzed, O
and O
the O
resulting O
sugars B-Chemical
were O
analyzed O
by O
colorimetric O
and O
gas O
chomatographic O
methods. O
Fructans B-Chemical
were O
measured O
with O
a O
colorimetric O
kit O
assay. O
Total O
dietary B-Chemical
fiber I-Chemical
values O
agreed O
with O
published O
values, O
with O
pectins B-Chemical
and O
neutral O
polysaccharides B-Chemical
of O
mannose B-Chemical
and O
glucose B-Chemical
residues O
predominating. O
Dipped O
raisins O
had O
over O
8% O
fructans. B-Chemical
No O
fructans B-Chemical
were O
found O
in O
fresh O
grapes. O
Raisin O
types O
varied O
in O
their O
ability O
to O
bind O
bile O
acids O
in O
vitro. O
Coarsely O
chopped O
raisins O
bound O
more O
bile O
than O
did O
finely O
chopped O
or O
whole O
raisins. O
