# Abstract
This O
report O
describes O
the O
primary O
structure O
and O
functional O
characteristics O
of O
human B-Species
ATA1, B-Gene
a O
subtype O
of O
the O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
A. O
The O
human B-Species
ATA1 B-Gene
cDNA O
was O
isolated O
from O
a O
placental O
cDNA O
library. O
The O
cDNA O
codes O
for O
a O
protein O
of O
487 O
amino O
acids O
with O
11 O
putative O
transmembrane O
domains. O
The O
transporter O
mRNA O
( O
approximately O
9.0 O
kb) O
is O
expressed O
most O
prominently O
in O
the O
placenta O
and O
heart, O
but O
detectable O
level O
of O
expression O
is O
evident O
in O
other O
tissues O
including O
the O
brain. O
When O
expressed O
heterologously O
in O
mammalian O
cells, O
the O
cloned O
transporter O
mediates O
Na(+)-coupled O
transport O
of O
the O
system O
A-specific O
model O
substrate O
alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric O
acid. O
The O
transport O
process O
is O
saturable O
with O
a O
Michaelis-Menten O
constant O
of O
0. O

0.12 O
mM. O
The O
Na(+):amino O
acid O
stoichiometry O
is O
1:1 O
as O
deduced O
from O
the O
Na(+)-activation O
kinetics. O
The O
transporter O
is O
specific O
for O
small O
short-chain O
neutral O
amino O
acids. O
The O
gene O
for O
the O
transporter O
is O
located O
on O
human B-Species
chromosome O
