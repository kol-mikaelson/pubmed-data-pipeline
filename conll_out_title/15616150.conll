the O
IC50 O

were O
up O

In O
contrast, O
the O

were O
3- O

the O
acid O

compared O
with O
the O
corresponding O

These O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
lactone B-Chemical

of O
statins O
exhibit O
differential O
substrate O

The O

exists O
in O
the O
body O

potentially O
influence O
drug-transporter O

observed O
between O
statins. O
