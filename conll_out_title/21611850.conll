# Abstract
Guar B-Chemical
gum I-Chemical
has O
a O
well-recognized O
hypolipidemic O
effect. O
This O
effect O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
due O
to O
the O
physicochemical O
properties O
of O
guar B-Chemical
gum, I-Chemical
which O
may O
cause O
changes O
in O
adsorption O
of O
lipids B-Chemical
or O
the O
viscosity O
of O
the O
intestinal O
contents. O
Guar B-Chemical
gum I-Chemical
is O
a O
non-specific O
absorption O
inhibitor O
of O
any O
type O
of O
lipid-soluble O
compound. O
Permanent O
lymph O
duct O
cannulation O
was O
performed O
on O
rats B-Species
to O
investigate O
the O
effects O
of O
dietary O
guar B-Chemical
gum I-Chemical
on O
lymph O
flow O
and O
lipid B-Chemical
transport. O
Rats B-Species
fed O
a O
5% O
guar B-Chemical
gum I-Chemical
diet O
were O
compared O
with O
those O
fed O
a O
5% O
cellulose B-Chemical
diet, O
and O
lymph O
was O
collected O
after O
feeding. O
The O
water-holding O
capacity O
(WHC), O
settling O
volume O
in O
water B-Chemical
(SV), O
and O
viscosity O
of O
guar B-Chemical
gum I-Chemical
were O
compared O
with O
those O
of O
cellulose. B-Chemical
Rats B-Species
fed O
with O
the O
guar B-Chemical
gum I-Chemical
diet O
had O
significantly O
lower O
lymph O
flow O
and O
lymphatic O
lipid B-Chemical
transport O
than O
did O
rats B-Species
fed O
with O
the O
cellulose B-Chemical
diet. O
The O
WHC, O
SV, O
and O
viscosity O
of O
guar B-Chemical
gum I-Chemical
were O
significantly O
higher O
than O
those O
of O
cellulose. B-Chemical
We O
propose O
that O
dietary O
guar B-Chemical
gum I-Chemical
reduces O
lymph O
flow O
and O
thereby O
diminishes O
lipid B-Chemical
transport O
by O
means O
of O
its O
physicochemical O
properties O
related O
to O
water B-Chemical
behavior O
in O
the O
intestine. O
