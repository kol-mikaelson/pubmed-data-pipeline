We O

two O

the O

VLCS B-Gene
gene O
and O
another O
(hVLCS-H1) O
encodes O
a O
related O
heart-specific O
protein. O
Here, O
we O
report O
the O
cloning O
of O
a O
third O
gene O
(hVLCS-H2) O
and O
characterization O

The O
hVLCS-H2 O
gene O
is O
located O
on O
human B-Species
chromosome B-Chromosome
19 I-Chromosome
and O
encodes O
a O
690-amino-acid O
protein. O
The O
amino O

of O
hVLCS-H2 O
is O
44-45% O

and O
67-69% O
similar O
to O
those O
of O

and O

The O

However, O

For O
all O

the O
hVLCS-H2 O

significantly O
increased O
(P O

not O

Thus, O
the O
