# Abstract
Members O
of O
phosphoinositide-specific O
phospholipase O

families O
are O
central O
intermediary O
in O
signal O

in O
response O
to O
the O
occupancy O
of O

by O
many O
growth O
factors. O
Among O
PLC O
isoforms, O
the O
type O
beta(1) B-Gene
is O
of O
particular O
interest O
because O
of O
its O
reported O
nuclear O
localisation O
in O
addition O
to O
its O
presence O
at O
the O
plasma O

It O
has O
been O
previously O

that O
both O
the O
stimulation O
and O
the O
inhibition O
of O
the O
nuclear O
PLCbeta(1) B-Gene

implicate O
PLCbeta(1) B-Gene
as O
an O
important O
enzyme O

with O
the O
rat B-Species

cDNA O
probe, O
we O
have O
identified O
a O
clone O

a O
sequence O
in O
gene O
bank O
called O
KIAA O
0581, O
which O
