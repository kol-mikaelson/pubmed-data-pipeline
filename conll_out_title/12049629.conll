# Abstract
Electron O
transfer O
flavoprotein-ubiquinone O
oxidoreductase O
(ETF-QO) B-Gene
is O
an O
iron-sulphur B-Chemical
flavoprotein I-Chemical
and O
a O
component O
of O
an O
electron-transfer O
system O
that O
links O
10 O
different O
mitochondrial O
flavoprotein O
dehydrogenases O
to O
the O
mitochondrial O
bc1 O
complex O
via O
electron O
transfer O
flavoprotein O
(ETF) O
and O
ubiquinone. B-Chemical
ETF-QO B-Gene
is O
an O
integral O
membrane O
protein, O
and O
the O
primary O
sequences O
of O
human B-Species
and O
porcine O
ETF-QO B-Gene
were O
deduced O
from O
the O
sequences O
of O
the O
cloned O
cDNAs. O
We O
have O
expressed O
human B-Species
ETF-QO B-Gene
in O
Sf9 B-CellLine
insect O
cells O
using O
a O
baculovirus O
vector. O
The O
cDNA O
encoding O
the O
entire O
protein, O
including O
the O
mitochondrial O
targeting O
sequence, O
was O
present O
in O
the O
vector. O
We O
isolated O
a O
membrane-bound O
form O
of O
the O
enzyme O
that O
has O
a O
molecular O
mass O
identical O
with O
that O
of O
the O
mature O
porcine O
protein O
as O
determined O
by O
SDS B-Chemical
PAGE O
and O
has O
an O
N-terminal O
sequence O
that O
is O
identical O
with O
that O
predicted O
for O
the O
mature O
holoenzyme. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
heterologously O
expressed O
ETF-QO B-Gene
is O
targeted O
to O
mitochondria O
and O
processed O
to O
the O
mature, O
catalytically O
active O
form. O
The O
detergent-solubilized O
protein O
was O
purified O
by O
ion-exchange O
and O
hydroxyapatite B-Chemical
chromatography. O
Absorption O
and O
EPR O
spectroscopy O
and O
redox O
titrations O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
presence O
of O
flavin B-Chemical
and O
iron-sulphur O
centres O
that O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
in O
the O
equivalent O
porcine O
and O
bovine B-Species
proteins. O
Additionally, O
the O
redox O
potentials O
of O
the O
two O
prosthetic O
groups O
appear O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
the O
other O
eukaryotic O
ETF-QO B-Gene
proteins. O
The O
steady-state O
kinetic O
constants O
of O
human B-Species
ETF-QO B-Gene
were O
determined O
with O
ubiquinone B-Chemical
homologues, O
a O
ubiquinone B-Chemical
analogue, O
and O
with O
human B-Species
wild-type O
ETF O
and O
a O
Paracoccus-human O
chimaeric O
ETF O
as O
varied O
substrates. O
The O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
this O
expression O
system O
provides O
sufficient O
amounts O
of O
human B-Species
ETF-QO B-Gene
to O
enable O
crystallization O
and O
mechanistic O
investigations O
of O
the O
iron-sulphur B-Chemical
flavoprotein. I-Chemical
