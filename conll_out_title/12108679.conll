# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
The O
association O
between O
the O
dihydrolipoamide O
acetyltransferase O
component O
(E2) O
of O
pyruvate O
dehydrogenase O
complex O
(PDC) O
and O
primary B-Disease
biliary I-Disease
cirrhosis I-Disease
(PBC) B-Disease
is O
clinically O
established. O
However, O
the O
detailed O
pathological O
function O
of O
the O
PDC-E2 B-Gene
gene O
is O
as O
yet O
unclear. O
In O
order O
to O
study O
the O
gene O
function O
in O
knockout O
and O
transgenic O
mouse B-Species
models, O
we O
cloned O
and O
characterized O
the O
mouse B-Species
PDC-E2 B-Gene
(mPDC-E2) O
gene. O
Because O
the O
expression O
level O
of O
PDC-E2 B-Gene
was O
elevated O
in O
PBC B-Disease
bile O
duct O
cells, O
we O
tried O
to O
construct O
a O
bile B-Disease
duct I-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
cell O
line O
that O
overexpressed O
PDC-E2 B-Gene
as O
a O
PBC B-Disease
cell O
model. O
METHODS: O
The O
mPDC-E2 O
cDNA O
was O
obtained O
by O
the O
3'Race O
method. O
We O
overexpressed O
this O
gene O
in O
KMBC B-CellLine
cells, O
using O
a O
retrovirus O
vector. O
The O
transcript O
and O
translated O
protein O
of O
mPDC-E2 O
were O
detected O
by O
Northern O
blot O
and O
Western O
blot, O
respectively. O
RESULTS: O
The O
deduced O
amino-acid O
sequence O
from O
the O
cloned O
cDNA O
indicated O
that O
the O
fully O
mature O
protein O
consisted O
of O
557 O
amino-acid O
residues, O
with O
a O
calculated O
molecular O
mass O
of O
59kD. O
This O
mature O
protein O
was O
highly O
consistent O
with O
those O
of O
previously O
reported O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
PDC-E2, B-Gene
which O
possessed O
three O
structurally O
identifiable O
regions: O
the O
lipoyl-bearing O
domain, O
the O
E3-binding O
site, O
and O
the O
catalytic O
domain. O
Mouse B-Species
fibroblast O
NIH3T3 B-CellLine
cells O
expressed O
one O
species O
of O
mPDC-E2 O
mRNA, O
3.5kb O
in O
length. O
We O
also O
successfully O
constructed O
a O
stable O
KMBC B-CellLine
cell O
line O
overexpressing O
the O
PDC-E2. B-Gene
CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
is O
the O
first O
report O
of O
the O
mPDC-E2 O
sequence O
and O
is O
valuable O
for O
further O
investigation O
of O
PDC-E2 B-Gene
gene O
function O
in O
transgenic O
or O
knockout O
mouse B-Species
models. O
The O
PDC-E2 B-Gene
overexpressing O
KMBC B-CellLine
cell O
line O
can O
be O
used O
to O
study O
alterations O
in O
signal O
transduction O
or O
gene O
expression O
profiles O
in O
PBC B-Disease
bile O
duct. O
