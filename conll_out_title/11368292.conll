# Abstract
Fluvastatin, B-Chemical
the O
first O
fully O
synthetic O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitor, O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
cholesterol B-Chemical
in O
patients B-Species
with O
hyperlipidaemia, B-Disease
to O
prevent O
subsequent O
coronary O
events O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
established O
coronary B-Disease
heart I-Disease
disease, I-Disease
and O
to O
alter O
endothelial O
function O
and O
plaque O
stability O
in O
animal O
models. O
Fluvastatin B-Chemical
is O
relatively O
hydrophilic, O
compared O
with O
the O
semisynthetic O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors, O
and, O
therefore, O
it O
is O
extensively O
absorbed O
from O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract. O
After O
absorption, O
it O
is O
nearly O
completely O
extracted O
and O
metabolised O
in O
the O
liver O
to O
2 O
hydroxylated O
metabolites O
and O
an O
N-desisopropyl O
metabolite, O
which O
are O
excreted O
in O
the O
bile. O
Approximately O
95% O
of O
a O
dose O
is O
recovered O
in O
the O
faeces, O
with O
60% O
of O
a O
dose O
recovered O
as O
the O
3 O
metabolites. O
The O
6-hydroxy B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
N-desisopropyl I-Chemical
fluvastatin B-Chemical
metabolites O
are O
exclusively O
generated O
by O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) I-Gene
2C9 I-Gene
and O
do O
not O
accumulate O
in O
the O
blood. O
CYP2C9, B-Gene
CYP3A4, B-Gene
CYP2C8 B-Gene
and O
CYP2D6 B-Gene
form O
the O
5-hydroxy B-Chemical
fluvastatin B-Chemical
metabolite. O
Because O
of O
its O
hydrophilic O
nature O
and O
extensive O
plasma O
protein O
binding, O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
has O
a O
small O
volume O
of O
distribution O
with O
minimal O
concentrations O
in O
extrahepatic O
tissues. O
The O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
are O
not O
influenced O
by O
renal O
function, O
due O
to O
its O
extensive O
metabolism O
and O
biliary O
excretion; O
limited O
data O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
cirrhosis B-Disease
suggest O
a O
30% O
reduction O
in O
oral O
clearance. O
Age O
and O
gender O
do O
not O
appear O
to O
affect O
the O
disposition O
of O
fluvastatin. B-Chemical
CYP3A4 B-Gene
inhibitors O
(erythromycin, B-Chemical
ketoconazole B-Chemical
and O
itraconazole) B-Chemical
have O
no O
effect O
on O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics, O
in O
contrast O
to O
other O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors O
which O
are O
primarily O
metabolised O
by O
CYP3A B-Gene
and O
are O
subject O
to O
potential O
drug O
interactions O
with O
CYP3A B-Gene
inhibitors. O
Coadministration O
of O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
with O
gastrointestinal O
agents O
such O
as O
cholestyramine, B-Chemical
and O
gastric O
acid O
regulating O
agents O
(H2 O
receptor O
antagonists O
and O
proton O
pump O
inhibitors), O
significantly O
alters O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
disposition O
by O
decreasing O
and O
increasing O
bioavailability, O
respectively. O
The O
nonspecific O
CYP O
inducer O
rifampicin B-Chemical
(rifampin) B-Chemical
significantly O
increases O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
oral O
clearance. O
In O
addition O
to O
being O
a O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
substrate, O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
demonstrates O
inhibitory O
effects O
on O
this O
isoenzyme O
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo. O
In O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes, O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
significantly O
inhibits O
the O
hydroxylation O
of O
2 O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
substrates, O
tolbutamide B-Chemical
and O
diclofenac. B-Chemical
The O
oral O
clearances O
of O
the O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
substrates O
diclofenac, B-Chemical
tolbutamide, B-Chemical
glibenclamide B-Chemical
(glyburide) B-Chemical
and O
losartan B-Chemical
are O
reduced O
by O
15 O
to O
25% O
when O
coadministered O
with O
fluvastatin. B-Chemical
These O
alterations O
have O
not O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
clinically O
significant. O
There O
are O
inadequate O
data O
evaluating O
the O
potential O
interaction O
of O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
with O
warfarin B-Chemical
and O
phenytoin, B-Chemical
2 O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
substrates O
with O
a O
narrow O
therapeutic O
index, O
and O
caution O
is O
recommended O
when O
using O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
with O
these O
agents. O
Fluvastatin B-Chemical
does O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
a O
significant O
effect O
on O
other O
CYP O
isoenzymes O
or O
P-glycoprotein-mediated O
transport O
in O
