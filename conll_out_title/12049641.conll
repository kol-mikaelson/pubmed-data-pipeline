It O

therefore O
often O
referred O
to O
as O
hCAT-4 O
even O
though O
no O
convincing O

been O

for O
this O

We O
expressed O
SLC7A4 B-Gene
in O
Xenopus B-Species

oocytes, O
but O
could O
not O
detect O
any O
transport O
activity O
for O
cationic, O
neutral O
or O
anionic O
amino O

or O
for O
the O

In O
addition, O
human B-Species

stably O
overexpressing O
a O
fusion O
protein O
between O
SLC7A4 B-Gene
and O
the O
enhanced O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
(EGFP) O
did O
not O
exhibit O
an O
increased O
transport O
activity O
for O
l-arginine. B-Chemical
The O
lack O
of O
transport O
activity O
was O
not O
due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
SLC7A4 B-Gene
protein O
expression O
in O
the O
plasma O
membrane, O
as O
in O
both O
cell O
types O
SLC7A4-EGFP O
exhibited O
a O
similar O
subcellular O
localization O
and O
level O
of O
protein O
expression O
as O
functional O
hCAT-EGFP O
proteins. O
The O
expression O
of O
SLC7A4 B-Gene
can O
be O
induced O
in O
NT2 B-CellLine
teratocarcinoma B-Disease
cells O
by O
treatment O
with O
retinoic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
However, O
also O
for O
this O
endogenously O
expressed O
SLC7A4, B-Gene
we O
could O
not O
detect O
any O
transport O
activity O
for O
l-arginine. B-Chemical
Our O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
SLC7A4 B-Gene
in O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
induce O
an O
amino O
acid O
transport O
activity O
in O
X. B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
or O
human B-Species
cells. O
Therefore, O
SLC7A4 B-Gene
is O
either O
not O
an O
amino O
acid O
transporter O
or O
it O
needs O
additional O
(protein) O
factor(s) O
to O
