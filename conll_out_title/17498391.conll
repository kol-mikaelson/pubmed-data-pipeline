# Abstract
PURPOSE: O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
quantify O
the O
intestinal O
metabolism O
of O
midazolam, B-Chemical
a O
CYP O
P450 O
substrate, O
usually O
used O
as O
a O
probe O
for O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
isoform O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
1 I-Gene
and O
to O
compare O
it O
with O
previous O
results O
obtained O
for O
other O
P450 O
substrates O
such O
as O
testosterone, B-Chemical
dextromethorphan B-Chemical
and O
bupropion, B-Chemical
which O
show O
some O
specificities O
for O
different O
CYP O
isoforms. O
The O
aim O
was O
to O
shed O
light O
on O
the O
role O
of O
metabolism O
in O
the O
intestinal O
tissues O
and O
the O
relationship O
with O
efflux O
mechanisms, O
such O
as O
by O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
(P-gp) B-Gene
and O
the O
influence O
of O
metabolism O
on O
bioavailability. O
METHODS: O
We O
used O
the O
improved O
everted O
rat B-Species
gut O
sac O
model O
to O
study O
in O
vitro O
the O
absorption O
and O
metabolism O
of O
the O
different O
CYP O
isoenzyme O
probes: O
midazolam, B-Chemical
testosterone, B-Chemical
bupropion B-Chemical
and O
dextromethorphan. B-Chemical
This O
method O
enables O
drug O
metabolism O
to O
be O
studied O
during O
absorption, O
conditions O
which O
mimic O
the O
in O
vivo O
situation. O
The O
drugs O
and O
their O
metabolites O
were O
measured O
by O
LC-MS O
in O
the O
mucosal O
and O
serosal O
media O
and O
in O
the O
mucosal O
tissue, O
to O
give O
a O
complete O
picture O
of O
the O
transport O
and O
metabolism. O
RESULTS: O
Midazolam, B-Chemical
as O
with O
the O
other O
CYP O
probes, O
was O
metabolized O
in O
everted O
gut O
sacs. O
The O
metabolites O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
same O
proportions O
in O
both O
the O
serosal O
and O
mucosal O
compartments O
for O
midazolam, B-Chemical
testosterone B-Chemical
and O
bupropion. B-Chemical
In O
the O
case O
of O
dextromethorphan, B-Chemical
the O
metabolite O
methoxymorphinan B-Chemical
was O
found O
at O
a O
higher O
concentration O
in O
the O
mucosal O
compartment, O
indicating O
efflux O
from O
the O
cells. O
The O
transport O
of O
dextromethorphan B-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolite O
was O
not O
modified O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
verapamil, B-Chemical
a O
P-gp B-Gene
inhibitor, O
thus O
demonstrating O
that O
dextromethorphan B-Chemical
and O
methoxymorphinan B-Chemical
were O
not O
P-gp B-Gene
substrates. O
CONCLUSION: O
Given O
that O
the O
rat B-Species
is O
a O
widely O
used O
species O
for O
pre-clinical O
studies, O
the O
everted O
gut O
sac O
model O
provides O
a O
useful O
tool O
to O
assess O
the O
role O
of O
metabolism O
during O
drug O
absorption O
by O
the O
intestine O
and O
is O
also O
capable O
of O
demonstrating O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
mediated O
transport. O
