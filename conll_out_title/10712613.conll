# Abstract
The O
conversion O
of O
L-threonine B-Chemical
to O
glycine B-Chemical
in O
both O
prokaryotes O
and O
eukaryotes O
takes O
place O
through O
a O
two-step O
biochemical O
pathway O
involving O
the O
enzymes O
L-threonine B-Chemical
dehydrogenase O
(EC O
1.1.1103) O
and O
2-amino-3-ketobutyrate B-Gene
coenzyme I-Gene
A I-Gene
ligase I-Gene
(KBL; B-Gene

2.3.1.29). O
The O

encoding O
these O

have O
been O
described O
in O

not O
in O
eukaryotes. O
We O
report O
the O
