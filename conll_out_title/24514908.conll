# Abstract
Cellular O
processes O
are O
exquisitely O
sensitive O
to O
H+ O
and O
Ca2+ B-Chemical
ions O
because O
of O
powerful O
ionic O
interactions O
with O
proteins. O
By O
regulating O
the O
spatial O
and O
temporal O
distribution O
of O
intracellular O
[Ca2+] B-Chemical
and O
[H+], O
cells O
such O
as O
cardiac O
myocytes O
can O
exercise O
control O
over O
their O
biological O
function. O
A O
well-established O
paradigm O
in O
cellular O
physiology O
is O
that O
ion O
concentrations O
are O
regulated O
by O
specialized, O
membrane-embedded O
transporter O
proteins. O
Many O
of O
these O
couple O
the O
movement O
of O
two O
or O
more O
ionic O
species O
per O
transport O
cycle, O
thereby O
linking O
ion O
concentrations O
among O
neighbouring O
compartments. O
Here, O
we O
compare O
and O
contrast O
canonical O
membrane O
transport O
with O
a O
novel O
type O
of O
Ca(2+)-H+ O
coupling O
within O
cytoplasm, O
which O
produces O
uphill O
Ca2+ B-Chemical
transport O
energized O
by O
spatial O
H+ O
ion O
gradients, O
and O
can O
result O
in O
the O
cytoplasmic O
compartmentalization O
of O
Ca2+ B-Chemical
without O
requiring O
a O
partitioning O
membrane. O
The O
mechanism, O
demonstrated O
in O
mammalian O
myocytes, O
relies O
on O
diffusible O
cytoplasmic O
buffers, O
such O
as O
carnosine, O
homocarnosine O
and O
ATP, B-Chemical
to O
which O
Ca2+ B-Chemical
and O
H+ O
ions O
bind O
in O
an O
apparently O
competitive O
manner. O
These O
buffer O
molecules O
can O
actively O
recruit O
Ca2+ B-Chemical
to O
acidic O
microdomains, O
in O
exchange O
for O
the O
movement O
of O
H+ O
ions. O
The O
resulting O
Ca2+ B-Chemical
microdomains O
thus O
have O
the O
potential O
to O
regulate O
function O
locally. O
Spatial O
cytoplasmic O
Ca(2+)-H+ O
exchange O
(cCHX) O
acts O
like O
a O
'pump' O
without O
a O
membrane O
and O
may O
be O
operational O
in O
many O
cell O
types. O
