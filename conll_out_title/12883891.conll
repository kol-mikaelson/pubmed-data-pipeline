The O
SLC22 O
drug O
transporter O
family. O

# Abstract
The O
SLC22 O
family O
comprises O
organic O
cation O
transporters O
(OCTs), O
zwitterion O
cation O
transporters O
(OCTNs), O
and O
organic O
anion O
transporters O
(OATs). O
These O
transporters O
contain O
12 O
predicted O
alpha-helical O
transmembrane O
domains O
(TMDs) O
and O
one O
large O
extracellular O
loop O
between O
TMDs O
1 O
and O
2. O
Transporters O
of O
the O
SLC22 O
family O
function O
in O
different O
ways: O
(1) O
as O
uniporters O
that O
mediate O
facilitated O
diffusion O
in O
either O
direction O
(OCTs), O
(2) O
as O
anion O
exchangers O
(OAT1, O
OAT3 O
and O
URAT1), O
and O
(3) O
as O
Na(+) O
l-carnitine B-Chemical
cotransporter O
(OCTN2). O
They O
participate O
in O
the O
absorption O
and O
or O
excretion O
of O
drugs, O
xenobiotics, O
and O
endogenous O
compounds O
in O
intestine, O
liver O
and O
or O
kidney, O
and O
perform O
homeostatic O
functions O
in O
brain O
and O
heart. O
The O
endogenous O
substrates O
include O
monoamine B-Chemical
neurotransmitters, I-Chemical
choline, B-Chemical
l-carnitine, B-Chemical
alpha-ketoglutarate, B-Chemical
cAMP, B-Chemical
cGMP, B-Chemical
prostaglandins, B-Chemical
and O
urate. O
Defect O
mutations O
of O
transporters O
of O
the O
SLC22 O
family O
may O
cause O
specific O
diseases O
such O
as O
"primary O
systemic O
carnitine O
deficiency" O
or O
"idiopathic O
renal O
hypouricemia" O
or O
change O
drug O
absorption O
or O
excretion. O
