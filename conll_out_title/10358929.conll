Pathways O

phosphoinositide B-Chemical
synthesis. O

# Abstract
In O
eukaryotic O
cells, O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
can O
be O
phosphorylated O
on O
the O
inositol B-Chemical
ring O
by O
a O
series O
of O
kinases O
to O
produce O
at O
least O
seven O
distinct O
phosphoinositides. B-Chemical
These O
lipids B-Chemical
have O
been O
implicated O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
cellular O
processes, O
including O
calcium B-Chemical
regulation, O
actin O
rearrangement, O
vesicle O
trafficking, O
cell O
survival O
and O
mitogenesis. O
The O
phosphorylated O
lipids B-Chemical
can O
act O
as O
precursors O
of O
second O
messengers O
or O
act O
directly O
to O
recruit O
specific O
signaling O
proteins O
to O
the O
membrane. O
A O
number O
of O
the O
kinases O
responsible O
for O
producing O
these O
lipids B-Chemical
have O
been O
purified O
and O
their O
cDNA O
clones O
have O
been O
isolated. O
The O
most O
well O
characterized O
of O
these O
enzymes O
are O
the O
phosphoinositide B-Chemical
3-kinases. O
However, O
progress O
has O
also O
been O
made O
in O
the O
characterization O
of O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
4-kinases O
and O
phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate O
5-kinases. O
In O
addition, O
new O
pathways O
involving O
phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate O
4-kinases, O
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate O
5-kinases O
and O
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate O
4-kinases O
have O
recently O
been O
described. O
The O
various O
enzymes O
and O
pathways O
involved O
in O
the O
synthesis O
of O
cellular O
phosphoinositides B-Chemical
will O
be O
discussed. O
