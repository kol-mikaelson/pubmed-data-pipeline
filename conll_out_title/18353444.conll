# Abstract
Multidrug B-Gene
resistance I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(MRP) I-Gene
4 I-Gene
is O
a O
member O
of O
the O
MRP O
ABCC B-Gene
subfamily O
of O
ATP-binding O
cassette O
transporters, O
which O
are O
capable O
of O
pumping O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
endogenous O
and O
xenobiotic O
organic O
anionic O
compounds O
out O
of O
the O

of O
a O
wide O

MRP4 B-Gene
ABCC4 B-Gene
has O
the O
remarkable O
ability O
to O
transport O
molecules O
involved O
in O
cellular O
signalling. O
These O
molecules O
include O
cyclic B-Chemical
nucleotides, I-Chemical
eicosanoids, B-Chemical
urate B-Chemical
and O
conjugated O
steroids. O
The O
unique O
structure, O

and O
dual O
localisation O
of O
MRP4 B-Gene
in O
polarised O
cells O
could O
be O
connected O
with O
a O
key O

in O
cellular O
protection O
and O
extracellular O
signalling O
pathways. O
This O
review O
focuses O
on O
recent O
insights O
into O
the O
versatile O
transport O
function O
of O
MRP4 B-Gene
and O
its O
potential O
as O
a O
