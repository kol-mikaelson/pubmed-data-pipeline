# Abstract
Melatonin B-Chemical
is O
a O
methoxyindole B-Chemical
synthesized O
and O
secreted O
principally O
by O
the O
pineal O
gland O
at O
night O
under O
normal O
environmental O
conditions. O
The O
endogenous O
rhythm O
of O
secretion O
is O
generated O
by O
the O
suprachiasmatic O
nuclei O
and O
entrained O
to O
the O
light O
dark O
cycle. O
Light O
is O
able O
to O
either O
suppress O
or O
synchronize O
melatonin B-Chemical
production O
according O
to O
the O
light O
schedule. O
The O
nycthohemeral O
rhythm O
of O
this O
hormone O
can O
be O
determined O
by O
repeated O
measurement O
of O
plasma O
or O
saliva O
melatonin B-Chemical
or O
urine O
sulfatoxymelatonin, B-Chemical
the O
main O
hepatic O
metabolite. O
The O
primary O
physiological O
function O
of O
melatonin, B-Chemical
whose O
secretion O
adjusts O
to O
night O
length, O
is O
to O
convey O
information O
concerning O
the O
daily O
cycle O
of O
light O
and O
darkness O
to O
body O
physiology. O
This O
information O
is O
used O
for O
the O
organisation O
of O
functions, O
which O
respond O
to O
changes O
in O
the O
photoperiod O
such O
as O
the O
seasonal O
rhythms. O
Seasonal O
rhythmicity O
of O
physiological O
functions O
in O
humans B-Species
related O
to O
possible O
alteration O
of O
the O
melatonin B-Chemical
message O
remains, O
however, O
of O
limited O
evidence O
in O
temperate O
areas O
in O
field O
conditions. O
Also, O
the O
daily O
melatonin B-Chemical
secretion, O
which O
is O
a O
very O
robust O
biochemical O
signal O
of O
night, O
can O
be O
used O
for O
the O
organisation O
of O
circadian O
rhythms. O
Although O
functions O
of O
this O
hormone O
in O
humans B-Species
are O
mainly O
based O
on O
correlative O
observations, O
there O
is O
some O
evidence O
that O
melatonin B-Chemical
stabilises O
and O
strengthens O
coupling O
of O
circadian O
rhythms, O
especially O
of O
core O
temperature O
and O
sleep-wake O
rhythms. O
The O
circadian O
organisation O
of O
other O
physiological O
functions O
could O
depend O
on O
the O
melatonin B-Chemical
signal, O
for O
instance O
immune, O
antioxidative O
defences, O
hemostasis O
and O
glucose B-Chemical
regulation. O
Since O
the O
regulating O
system O
of O
melatonin B-Chemical
secretion O
is O
complex, O
following O
central O
and O
autonomic O
pathways, O
there O
are O
many O
pathophysiological O
situations O
where O
the O
melatonin B-Chemical
secretion O
can O
be O
disturbed. O
The O
resulting O
alteration O
could O
increase O
predisposition O
to O
disease, O
add O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
symptoms O
or O
modify O
the O
course O
and O
outcome O
of O
the O
disorder. O
