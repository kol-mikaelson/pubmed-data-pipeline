# Abstract
Squalene B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
squalene, B-Chemical
a O
key O
cholesterol B-Chemical
precursor, O
through O
a O
reductive O
dimerization O
of O
two O
farnesyl B-Chemical
diphosphate I-Chemical
(FPP) B-Chemical
molecules. O
The O
reaction O
is O
unique O
when O
compared O
with O
those O
of O
other O
FPP-utilizing O
enzymes O
and O
proceeds O
in O
two O
distinct O
steps, O
both O
of O
which O
involve O
the O
formation O
of O
carbocationic O
reaction O
intermediates. O
Because O
FPP B-Chemical
is O
located O
at O
the O
final O
branch O
point O
in O
the O
isoprenoid B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
pathway, O
its O
conversion O
to O
squalene B-Chemical
through O
the O
action O
of O
squalene B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
represents O
the O
first O
committed O
step O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
cholesterol, B-Chemical
making O
it O
an O
attractive O
target O
for O
therapeutic O
intervention. O
We O
have O
determined, O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
the O
crystal O
structures O
of O
recombinant O
human B-Species
squalene B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
complexed O
with O
several O
different O
inhibitors. O
The O
structure O
shows O
that O
SQS O
is O
folded O
as O
a O
single O
domain, O
with O
a O
large O
channel O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
one O
face. O
The O
active O
sites O
of O
the O
two O
half-reactions O
catalyzed O
by O
the O
enzyme O
are O
located O
in O
the O
central O
channel, O
which O
is O
lined O
on O
both O
sides O
by O
conserved O
aspartate O
and O
arginine O
residues, O
which O
are O
known O
from O
mutagenesis O
experiments O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
FPP B-Chemical
binding. O
One O
end O
of O
this O
channel O
is O
exposed O
to O
solvent, O
whereas O
the O
other O
end O
leads O
to O
a O
completely O
enclosed O
pocket O
surrounded O
by O
conserved O
hydrophobic O
residues. O
These O
observations, O
along O
with O
mutagenesis O
data O
identifying O
residues O
that O
affect O
substrate O
binding O
and O
activity, O
suggest O
that O
two O
molecules O
of O
FPP B-Chemical
bind O
at O
one O
end O
of O
the O
channel, O
where O
the O
active O
center O
of O
the O
first O
half-reaction O
is O
located, O
and O
then O
the O
stable O
reaction O
intermediate O
moves O
into O
the O
deep O
pocket, O
where O
it O
is O
sequestered O
from O
solvent O
and O
the O
second O
half-reaction O
occurs. O
Five O
alpha O
helices O
surrounding O
the O
active O
center O
are O
structurally O
homologous O
to O
the O
active O
core O
in O
the O
three O
other O
isoprenoid B-Chemical
biosynthetic O
enzymes O
whose O
crystal O
structures O
are O
known, O
even O
though O
there O
is O
no O
detectable O
sequence O
homology. O
