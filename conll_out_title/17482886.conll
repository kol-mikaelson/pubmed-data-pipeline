Q10 I-Chemical
(CoQ10) B-Chemical
response O
to O
oral O

of O
various O
CoQ10 B-Chemical
formulations O
was O
examined. O
Both O

CoQ10 B-Chemical
and O
net O
increase O
over O
baseline O
CoQ10 B-Chemical
concentrations O
show O
a O
gradual O
increase O

The O
efficiency O
of O

decreases O
as O
the O

increases. O
About O
95% O
of O
circulating O
CoQ10 B-Chemical
occurs O
as O
ubiquinol, B-Chemical

the O
ratio O
following O
CoQ10 B-Chemical
ingestion. O
Higher O
plasma O
CoQ10 B-Chemical
concentrations O
are O
necessary O

and O
also O
the O

Solubilized O
formulations O
of O
CoQ10 B-Chemical
(both O
ubiquinone B-Chemical

have O
superior O
