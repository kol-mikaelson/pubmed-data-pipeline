# Abstract
To O
investigate O
the O

pivalate B-Chemical
on O
carnitine B-Chemical
import O

in O
the O

we O
measured O

The O

The O

whereas O
the O
concentrations O

In O
the O
heart O

the O
concentration O

carnitine B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
lower O

These O
results O

that O
carnitine B-Chemical
transport O
