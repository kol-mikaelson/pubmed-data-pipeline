# Abstract
The O
transport O
of O
amino O
acids O
in O
kidney O
and O
intestine O
is O
critical O
for O
the O
supply O
of O
amino O
acids O
to O
all O
tissues O
and O
the O
homeostasis O
of O
plasma O
amino O
acid O
levels. O
This O
is O
illustrated O
by O
a O
number O
of O
inherited B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
affecting O
amino O
acid O
transport O
in O
epithelial O
cells, O
such O
as O
cystinuria, B-Disease
lysinuric B-Disease
protein I-Disease
intolerance, I-Disease
Hartnup B-Disease
disorder, I-Disease
iminoglycinuria, O
dicarboxylic O
aminoaciduria, O
and O
some O
other O
less O
well-described O
disturbances O
of O
amino O
acid O
transport. O
The O
identification O
of O
most O
epithelial O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
over O
the O
past O
15 O
years O
allows O
the O
definition O
of O
these O
disorders O
at O
the O
molecular O
level O
and O
provides O
a O
clear O
picture O
of O
the O
functional O
cooperation O
between O
transporters O
in O
the O
apical O
and O
basolateral O
membranes O
of O
mammalian O
epithelial O
cells. O
Transport O
of O
amino O
acids O
across O
the O
apical O
membrane O
not O
only O
makes O
use O
of O
sodium-dependent O
symporters, O
but O
also O
uses O
the O
proton-motive O
force O
and O
the O
gradient O
of O
other O
amino O
acids O
to O
efficiently O
absorb O
amino O
acids O
from O
the O
lumen. O
In O
the O
basolateral O
membrane, O
antiporters O
cooperate O
with O
facilitators O
to O
release O
amino O
acids O
without O
depleting O
cells O
of O
valuable O
nutrients. O
With O
very O
few O
exceptions, O
individual O
amino O
acids O
are O
transported O
by O
more O
than O
one O
transporter, O
providing O
backup O
capacity O
for O
absorption O
in O
the O
case O
of O
mutational O
inactivation O
of O
a O
transport O
system. O
