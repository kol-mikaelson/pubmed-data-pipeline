# Abstract
Phosphoinositide-specific O
phospholipase O
C O
(PI-PLC) B-Gene
plays O
a O
pivotal O
role O
in O
regulation O
of O
intracellular O
signal O
transduction O
from O
various O
receptor O
molecules. O
More O
than O
10 O
members O
of O
human B-Species
PI-PLC B-Gene
isoforms O
have O
been O
identified O
and O
classified O
into O
three O
classes O
beta, O
gamma, O
and O
delta, O
which O
are O
regulated O
by O
distinct O
mechanisms. O
Here O
we O
report O
identification O
of O
a O
novel O
class O
of O
human B-Species
PI-PLC, B-Gene
named O
PLCepsilon, O
which O
is O
characterized O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
Ras-associating O
domain O
at O
its O
C O
terminus O
and O
a O
CDC25-like O
domain O
at O
its O
N O
terminus. O
The O
Ras-associating O
domain O
of O
PLCepsilon O
specifically O
binds O
to O
the O
GTP-bound O
forms O
of O
Ha-Ras O
and O
Rap1A. B-Gene
The O
dissociation O
constant O
for O
Ha-Ras O
is O
estimated O
to O
be O
approximately O
40 O
nm, O
comparable O
with O
those O
of O
other O
Ras O
effectors. O
Co-expression O
of O
an O
activated O
Ha-Ras O
mutant O
with O
PLCepsilon O
induces O
its O
translocation O
from O
the O
cytosol O
to O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
Upon O
stimulation O
with O
epidermal B-Gene
growth I-Gene
factor, I-Gene
similar O
translocation O
of O
ectopically O
expressed O
PLCepsilon O
is O
observed, O
which O
is O
inhibited O
by O
co-expression O
of O
dominant-negative O
Ha-Ras. O
Furthermore, O
using O
a O
liposome-based O
reconstitution O
assay, O
it O
is O
shown O
that O
the O
phosphatidylinositol O
4,5-bisphosphate-hydrolyzing O
activity O
of O
PLCepsilon O
is O
stimulated O
in O
vitro O
by O
Ha-Ras O
in O
a O
GTP-dependent O
manner. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
Ras O
directly O
regulates O
phosphoinositide O
breakdown O
through O
membrane O
targeting O
of O
PLCepsilon. O
