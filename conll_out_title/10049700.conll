# Abstract
We O
report O
here O
on O
the O
cloning O
and O
functional O
characterization O
of O
human B-Species
LAT1, B-Gene
a O
subunit O
of O
the O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
L. O
The O
hLAT1 O
cDNA, O
obtained O
from O
a O
human B-Species
placental O
cDNA O
library, O
codes O
for O
a O
protein O
of O
507 O
amino O
acids. O
When O
functionally O
expressed O
in O
mammalian O
cells O
together O
with O
the O
heavy O
chain O
of O
the O
rat O
4F2 O
antigen O
(r4F2hc), O
hLAT1 O
induces O
the O
transport O
of O
neutral O
amino O
acids. O
When O
expressed O
independently, O
neither O
hLAT1 O
nor O
r4F2hc O
was O
capable O
of O
amino O
acid O
transport O
to O
any O
significant O
extent. O
Thus, O
the O
hLAT1-r4F2hc O
heterodimeric O
complex O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
observed O
amino O
acid O
transport. O
The O
transport O
process O
induced O
by O
the O
heterodimer O
is O
Na+ O
independent O
and O
is O
not O
influenced O
by O
pH. O
It O
recognizes O
exclusively O
neutral O
amino O
acids O
with O
high O
affinity. O
LAT1-specific O
mRNA O
is O
expressed O
in O
most O
human B-Species
tissues O
with O
the O
notable O
exception O
of O
the O
intestine. O
