# Abstract
Protoporphyrin B-Chemical

the O
exogenous O
addition O
of O
delta-aminolevulinic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
reaches O
different O

Because O
many O

heme B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
of O
which O
protoporphyrin B-Chemical
IX I-Chemical
is O
penultimate, O
are O
located O

mitochondria, O
we O
surmised O
that O
the O
mitochondrial O
content O
of O

may O
relate O
to O

The O

These O
