# Abstract
The O
transmembrane O
glycoprotein O
CD36 O
has O
been O
identified O
in O
isolated O
cell O
studies O
as O
a O
putative O
transporter O
of O
long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
To O
examine O
the O
physiological O
role O
of O
CD36, O
we O
studied O
FA O
uptake O
and O
metabolism O
by O
tissues O
of O
CD36 O
null O
mice B-Species
after O
injection O
with O
two O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
analogs. O
Compared O
to O
controls, O
uptake O
was O
substantially O
reduced O
(50-80%) O
in O
heart, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
and O
adipose O
tissues O
of O
null O
mice. B-Species
The O
reduction O
in O
uptake O
was O
associated O
with O
a O
large O
decrease O
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
incorporation O
into O
triglycerides, B-Chemical
which O
could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
an O
accumulation O
of O
diacylglycerides. O
Thus O
CD36 O
facilitates O
a O
major O
fraction O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
by O
myocardial, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
and O
adipose O
tissues, O
where O
it O
is O
highly O
expressed. O
Its O
role O
in O
other O
tissues O
where O
its O
expression O
is O
low O
and O
cell-specific O
could O
not O
be O
determined O
in O
these O
studies. O
