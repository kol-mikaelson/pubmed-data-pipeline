# Abstract
To O
date, O
two O
new O
defects O
in O
the O
pentose B-Chemical
phosphate I-Chemical
pathway O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
abnormalities O
in O
their O
polyol B-Chemical
profiles. O
Some O
of O
them O
presented O
with O
neurological B-Disease
symptoms I-Disease
of O
so O
far O
unknown O
aetiology. O
The O
pathophysiological O
role O
of O
polyols, B-Chemical
e.g. O
in O
the O
brain, O
is O
relatively O
unknown. O
We O
tested O
the O
neurotoxicity B-Disease
of O
polyols B-Chemical
using O
a O
'neurochip' O
model. O
After O
exposure O
of O
cortical O
rat B-Species
neurons O
to O
D-arabitol B-Chemical
and O
ribitol B-Chemical
in O
increasing O
concentrations O
up O
to O
10 O
mmol O
L, O
the O
electrophysiological O
activity O
was O
measured. O
No O
acute O
effect O
on O
the O
spontaneous O
network O
activity O
of O
cortical O
neurons O
was O
observed. O
We O
speculate O
that O
polyols B-Chemical
have O
only O
secondary O
effects O
on O
brain B-Disease
dysfunction. I-Disease
