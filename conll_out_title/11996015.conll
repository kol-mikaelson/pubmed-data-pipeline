# Abstract
This O
chapter O
is O
an O
update O
of O
the O
data O
on O
substrates, O
reactions, O
inducers, O
and O
inhibitors O
of O
human B-Species
CYP O
enzymes O
published O
previously O
by O
Rendic O
and O
DiCarlo O
(1), O
now O
covering O
selection O
of O
the O
literature O
through O
2001 O
in O

section. O
The O
data O
are O
presented O
in O
a O
tabular O
form O
(Table O
1) O
to O
provide O
a O
framework O
for O
predicting O
and O
interpreting O
the O
new O
P450 O
metabolic O
data. O
The O
data O
are O
formatted O
in O
an O
Excel O
format O
as O
most O
suitable O
for O
off-line O
searching O
