# Abstract
Members O
of O
the O
solute O
carrier O
(SLC) O
36 O
family O
are O
involved O
in O
transmembrane O
movement O
of O
amino O
acids O
and O
derivatives. O
SLC36 O
consists O
of O
four O
members. O
SLC36A1 B-Gene
and O
SLC36A2 B-Gene
both O
function O
as O
H(+) O
-coupled O
amino O
acid O
symporters. O
SLC36A1 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
at O
the O
luminal O
surface O
of O
the O
small O
intestine O
but O
is O
also O
commonly O
found O
in O
lysosomes O
in O
many O
cell O
types O
(including O
neurones), O
suggesting O
that O
it O
is O
a O
multipurpose O
carrier O
with O
distinct O
roles O
in O
different O
cells O
including O
absorption O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
as O
an O
efflux O
pathway O
following O
intralysosomal O
protein O
breakdown. O
SLC36A1 B-Gene
has O
a O
relatively O
low O
affinity O
(K(m) O
1-10 O
mM) O
for O
its O
substrates, O
which O
include O
zwitterionic O
amino B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
imino I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
heterocyclic B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
amino O
acid-based O
drugs O
and O
derivatives O
used O
experimentally O
and O
or O
clinically O
to O
treat O
epilepsy, B-Disease
schizophrenia, B-Disease
bacterial B-Disease
infections, I-Disease
hyperglycaemia B-Disease
and O
cancer. B-Disease
SLC36A2 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
at O
the O
apical O
surface O
of O
the O
human B-Species
renal O
proximal O
tubule O
where O
it O
functions O
in O
the O
reabsorption O
of O
glycine, B-Chemical
proline B-Chemical
and O
hydroxyproline. B-Chemical
SLC36A2 B-Gene
also O
transports O
amino O
acid O
derivatives O
but O
has O
a O
narrower O
substrate O
selectivity O
and O
higher O
affinity O
(K(m) O
0.1-0.7 O
mM) O
than O
SLC36A1. B-Gene
Mutations O
in O
SLC36A2 B-Gene
lead O
to O
hyperglycinuria B-Disease
and O
iminoglycinuria. B-Disease
SLC36A3 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
only O
in O
testes O
and O
is O
an O
orphan O
transporter O
with O
no O
known O
function. O
SLC36A4 B-Gene
is O
widely O
distributed O
at O
the O
mRNA O
level O
and O
is O
a O
high-affinity O
(K(m) O
2-3 O
microM) O
transporter O
for O
proline B-Chemical
and O
tryptophan. B-Chemical
We O
have O
much O
to O
learn O
about O
this O
family O
of O
transporters, O
but O
from O
current O
knowledge, O
it O
seems O
likely O
that O
their O
function O
will O
influence O
the O
pharmacokinetic O
profiles O
of O
amino O
acid-based O
drugs O
by O
mediating O
transport O
in O
both O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
kidney. O
