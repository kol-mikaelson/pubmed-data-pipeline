# Abstract
Superoxide B-Chemical
dismutases O
are O
an O
ubiquitous O
family O
of O
enzymes O
that O
function O
to O
efficiently O
catalyze O
the O
dismutation O
of O
superoxide B-Chemical
anions. O
Three O
unique O
and O
highly O
compartmentalized O
mammalian O
superoxide B-Chemical
dismutases O
have O
been O
biochemically O
and O
molecularly O
characterized O
to O
date. O
SOD1, B-Gene
or O
CuZn-SOD O
(EC O
1.15.1.1), O
was O
the O
first O
enzyme O
to O
be O
characterized O
and O
is O
a O
copper B-Chemical
and O
zinc-containing O
homodimer O
that O
is O
found O
almost O
exclusively O
in O
intracellular O
cytoplasmic O
spaces. O
SOD2, B-Gene
or O
Mn-SOD B-Gene
(EC O
1.15.1.1), O
exists O
as O
a O
tetramer O
and O
is O
initially O
synthesized O
containing O
a O
leader O
peptide, O
which O
targets O
this O
manganese-containing O
enzyme O
exclusively O
to O
the O
mitochondrial O
spaces. O
SOD3, B-Gene
or O
EC-SOD B-Gene
(EC O
1.15.1.1), O
is O
the O
most O
recently O
characterized O
SOD, B-Gene
exists O
as O
a O
copper B-Chemical
and O
zinc-containing O
tetramer, O
and O
is O
synthesized O
containing O
a O
signal O
peptide O
that O
directs O
this O
enzyme O
exclusively O
to O
extracellular O
spaces. O
What O
role(s) O
these O
SODs O
play O
in O
both O
normal O
and O
disease O
states O
is O
only O
slowly O
beginning O
to O
be O
understood. O
A O
molecular O
understanding O
of O
each O
of O
these O
genes O
has O
proven O
useful O
toward O
the O
deciphering O
of O
their O
biological O
roles. O
For O
example, O
a O
variety O
of O
single O
amino O
acid O
mutations O
in O
SOD1 B-Gene
have O
been O
linked O
to O
familial B-Disease
amyotrophic I-Disease
lateral I-Disease
sclerosis. I-Disease
Knocking O
out O
the O
SOD2 B-Gene
gene O
in O
mice B-Species
results O
in O
a O
lethal O
cardiomyopathy. B-Disease
A O
single O
amino O
acid O
mutation O
in O
human B-Species
SOD3 B-Gene
is O
associated O
with O
10 O
to O
30-fold O
increases O
in O
serum O
SOD3 B-Gene
levels. O
As O
more O
information O
is O
obtained, O
further O
insights O
will O
be O
gained. O
