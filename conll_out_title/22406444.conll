# Abstract
Homocysteine B-Chemical
(Hcy)-thiolactone B-Chemical
is O
toxic, O
induces O
epileptic B-Disease
seizures B-Disease
in O
rodents, O
and O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
Alzheimer's B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
Paraoxonase B-Gene
1 I-Gene
(Pon1), B-Gene
a O
component O
of O
high-density O
lipoprotein, O
hydrolyzes O
Hcy-thiolactone B-Chemical
in O
vitro. O
Whether O
this O
reflects O
a O
physiological O
function O
and O
whether O
Pon1 B-Gene
can O
protect O
against O
Hcy-thiolactone B-Chemical
toxicity B-Disease
was O
unknown. O
Here O
we O
show O
that O
Hcy-thiolactone B-Chemical
was O
elevated O
in O
brains O
of O
Pon1- B-Gene
- O
mice B-Species
(1.5-fold, O
p O
= O
0.047) O
and O
that O
Pon1- B-Gene

mice B-Species
excrete O
more O
Hcy-thiolactone B-Chemical
than O
wild O
type O
animals O
(2.4-fold, O
p O
= O
0.047). O
The O
frequency O
of O
seizures B-Disease
induced O
by O
intraperitoneal O
injections O
of O
L-Hcy-thiolactone B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
higher O
in O
Pon1- B-Gene

mice B-Species
compared O
with O
wild O
type O
animals O
(52.8% O
versus O
29.5%, O
p O
= O
0.042); O
the O
latency O
of O
seizures B-Disease
was O
lower O
in O
Pon1- B-Gene
- O
mice B-Species
than O
in O
wild O
type O
animals O
(31.8 O
min O
versus O
41.2 O
min, O
p O

Using O
the O
Pon1 B-Gene
null O
mice, B-Species
we O
provide O
the O
first O
direct O
evidence O
that O
a O
specific O
Hcy O
metabolite, O
Hcy-thiolactone, B-Chemical
rather O
than O
Hcy O
itself O
is O
neurotoxic B-Disease
in O

Our O
findings O
indicate O
that O
Pon1 B-Gene
protects O
mice B-Species
against O
Hcy-thiolactone B-Chemical
neurotoxicity B-Disease
by O
hydrolyzing O
it O
in O
the O
brain, O
and O
suggest O
a O
mechanism O
by O
which O
Pon1 B-Gene
can O
protect O
against O
neurodegeneration B-Disease
associated O
with O
hyperhomocysteinemia B-Disease
and O
Alzheimer's B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
