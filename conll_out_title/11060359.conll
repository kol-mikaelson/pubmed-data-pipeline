# Abstract
alpha-Methylacyl-CoA B-Gene
racemase I-Gene
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
beta-oxidation O
of O
branched-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
derivatives O
because O
it O
catalyzes O
the O
conversion O
of O
several O
(2R)-methyl-branched-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acyl-CoAs I-Chemical
to O
their O
(S)-stereoisomers. O
Only O
stereoisomers O
with O
the O
2-methyl O
group O
in O
the O
(S)-configuration O
can O
be O
degraded O
via O
beta-oxidation. O
Patients B-Species

of I-Disease
alpha-methylacyl-CoA B-Gene

accumulate O

their O

pristanic B-Chemical

the O

acid I-Chemical
intermediates O
di- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
trihydroxycholestanoic I-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
which O
are O
all O
substrates O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation O
system. O
Subcellular O
fractionation O
experiments, O
however, O
revealed O
that O
both O
in O
humans B-Species
and O
rats B-Species
alpha-methylacyl-CoA B-Gene
racemase I-Gene
is O
bimodally O
distributed O
to O
both O
the O
peroxisome O
and O
the O
mitochondrion. O
Our O
findings O
show O
that O
the O
peroxisomal O
and O
mitochondrial O
enzymes O
are O
produced O
from O
the O
same O
gene O
and O
that, O
as O
a O
consequence, O
the O
bimodal O
distribution O
pattern O
must O
be O
the O
result O
of O
differential O
targeting O
of O
the O
same O
gene O
product. O
In O
addition, O
we O
investigated O
the O
physiological O
role O
of O
the O
enzyme O
in O
the O
mitochondrion. O
Both O
in O

studies O
with O
purified O
heterologously O
expressed O
protein O
and O
in O
vivo O
studies O
in O
fibroblasts O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
an O
alpha-methylacyl-CoA B-Gene
racemase I-Gene
deficiency O
revealed O
that O
the O
mitochondrial O
enzyme O
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
beta-oxidation O
of O
the O
breakdown O
products O
of O
pristanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
byconverting O
(2R,6)-dimethylheptanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
to O
its O
(S)-stereoisomer. O
