# Abstract
A O
family O
of O
five O
beta1,3-galactosyltransferases O
has O
been O
characterized O
that O
catalyze O
the O
formation O
of O
Galbeta1,3GlcNAcbeta O
and O
Galbeta1,3GalNAcbeta O
linkages O
present O
in O
glycoproteins O
and O
glycolipids B-Chemical
(beta3GalT1, B-Gene
-2, I-Gene
-3, I-Gene
-4, I-Gene
and I-Gene
-5). I-Gene
We O
now O
report O
a O
new O
member O
of O
the O
family O
(beta3GalT6), B-Gene
involved O
in O
glycosaminoglycan B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
The O
human B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
genes O
were O
located O
on O
chromosomes O
1p36.3 B-Chromosome
and O
4E2, O
respectively, O
and O
homologs O
are O
found O
in O
Drosophila B-Species
melanogaster I-Species
and O
Caenorhabditis B-Species
elegans. I-Species
Unlike O
other O
members O
of O
the O
family, O
beta3GalT6 B-Gene
showed O
a O
broad O
mRNA O
expression O
pattern O
by O
Northern O
blot O
analysis. O
Although O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
homology O
across O
several O
subdomains O
exists O
among O
other O
members O
of O
the O
beta3-galactosyltransferase O
family, O
recombinant O
enzyme O
did O
not O
utilize O
glucosamine- B-Chemical
or O
galactosamine-containing O
acceptors. O
Instead, O
the O
enzyme O
transferred O
galactose B-Chemical
from O
UDP-galactose B-Chemical
to O
acceptors O
containing O
a O
terminal O
beta-linked B-Chemical
galactose I-Chemical
residue. O
This O
product, O
Galbeta1,3Galbeta O
is O
found O
in O
the O
linkage O
region O
of O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
and O
chondroitin B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
(GlcAbeta1,3Galbeta1,3Galbeta1,4Xylbeta-O-Ser), O
indicating O
that O
beta3GalT6 B-Gene
is O
the O
so-called O
galactosyltransferase B-Gene
II I-Gene
involved O
in O
glycosaminoglycan B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
Its O
identity O
was O
confirmed O
in O
vivo O
by O
siRNA-mediated O
inhibition O
of O
glycosaminoglycan B-Chemical
synthesis O
in O
HeLa O
S3 O
cells. O
Its O
localization O
in O
the O
medial O
Golgi O
indicates O
that O
this O
is O
the O
major O
site O
for O
assembly O
of O
the O
linkage O
region. O
