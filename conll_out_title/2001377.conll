# Abstract
3-Hydroxy B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
with O
chain O
lengths O
ranging O
from O
6 O
to O
14 O
carbons B-Chemical
are O
excreted O
in O
human B-Species
urine. O
The O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
these O
acids O
is O
increased O
in O
conditions O
of O
increased O
mobilization O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
or O
inhibited O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation. O
Similar O
urinary O
profiles O
of O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
also O
observed O
in O
fasting O
rats. B-Species
The O
metabolic O
genesis O
of O
these O
urinary O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
was O
investigated O
in O
vitro O
with O
rat B-Species
liver O
postmitochondrial O
and O
mitochondrial O
fractions. O
3-Hydroxy B-Chemical
monocarboxylic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
ranging O
from O
3-hydroxyhexanoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
3-hydroxyhexadecanoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
were O
synthesized. O
In O
the O
rat B-Species
liver O
postmitochondrial O
fraction O
fortified O
with O
NADPH, B-Chemical
these O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
with O
carbon B-Chemical
chains O
equal O
to O
or O
longer O
than O
10 O
were O
oxidized O
to O
(omega B-Chemical
- I-Chemical

and O
omega-hydroxy O
metabolites O
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
corresponding O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
3-Hydroxyhexanoic B-Chemical
(3OHMC6) B-Chemical
and O
3-hydroxyoctanoic B-Chemical
(3OHMC8) B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
not O
metabolized. O
Upon O
the O
addition O
of O
mitochondria O
together O
with O
ATP, B-Chemical
CoA, B-Chemical
carnitine, B-Chemical
and O
MgCl2, B-Chemical
the O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
converted O
to O
3-hydroxyoctanedioic, B-Chemical
trans-2-hexenedioic, B-Chemical
suberic, B-Chemical
and O
adipic B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
In O
the O
urine O
of O
children O
with O
elevated O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
levels, O
3OHMC6, B-Chemical
3OHMC8, B-Chemical
3-hydroxydecanoic, B-Chemical
3,10-dihydroxydecanoic, B-Chemical
3,9-dihydroxydecanoic, B-Chemical
and O
3,11-dihydroxydodecanoic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
identified. O
On O
the O
basis O
of O
these O
data, O
we O
propose O
that O
the O
urinary O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
derived O
from O
the O
omega-oxidation O
of O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
the O
subsequent O
beta-oxidation O
of O
longer O
chain O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
These O
urinary O
3-hydroxy B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
not O
derived O
from O
the O
beta-oxidation O
of O
unsubstituted O
dicarboxylic O
acids. O
