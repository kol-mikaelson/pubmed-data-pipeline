# Abstract
Glycerol B-Chemical
1:2-cyclic I-Chemical
phosphate I-Chemical
is O
released O
simultaneously O
with O
glycerophosphate B-Chemical
when O
kidney O
glycerophosphinicocholine O
diesterase O
(EC O
3.1.4.2) O
acts O
on O
glycerylphosphorylcholine B-Chemical
and O
glycerylphosphorylethanolamine. B-Chemical
The O
percentage O
of O
cyclic B-Chemical
phosphate I-Chemical
ester I-Chemical
formed O
is O
increased O
at O
pH O
values O
below O
the O
optimum O
and O
is O
decreased O
when O
