# Abstract
Synthetic O
3-methyl-branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
used O
to O
decipher O
the O
breakdown O
of O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Based O
on O
results O
obtained O
in O
intact O
or O
permeabilized O
rat B-Species
hepatocytes, O
rat B-Species
liver O
homogenates O
or O
subcellular O
fractions, O
a O
revised O
alpha-oxidation O
pathway O
is O
proposed O
which O
appears O
to O
be O
functioning O
in O
man B-Species
as O
well. O
In O
a O
first O
step, O
the O
3-methyl-branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
activated O
by O
an O
acyl-CoA O
synthetase. O
This O
reaction O
requires O
CoA, B-Chemical
ATP B-Chemical
and O
Mg2+. B-Chemical
Subsequently, O
the O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
ester I-Chemical
is O
hydroxylated O
at O
position O
2 O
by O
a O
peroxisomal O
dioxygenase. O
This O
step O
is O
dependent O
on O
alpha-oxoglutarate, B-Chemical
ascorbate B-Chemical
(or O
glutathione), B-Chemical
Fe2+ B-Chemical
and O
O2. B-Chemical
The O
2-hydroxy-3-methylacyl-CoA B-Chemical
intermediate O
is O
cleaved O
by O
a O
peroxisomal O
lyase O
to O
formyl-CoA B-Chemical
and O
a O
2-methyl-branched B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
aldehyde. I-Chemical
Formyl-CoA B-Chemical
is O
(partly O
enzymically) O
hydrolyzed O
to O
formate, B-Chemical
which O
is O
then O
converted, O
most O
likely O
in O
the O
cytosol, O
to O
CO2. B-Chemical
In O
the O
presence O
of O
NAD+, B-Chemical
the O
aldehyde O
is O
dehydrogenated O
to O
a O
2-methyl-branched O
fatty O
acid, O
presumably O
by O
a O
peroxisomal O
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase. O
This O
acid O
can--after O
activation--be O
degraded O
via O
a O
D-specific O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation O
system. O
