# Title
Polyamines B-Chemical
and O
membrane O
transporters. O

# Abstract
In O
recent O
years, O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
membrane O
transporters O
(MTs) O
in O
the O
disposition O
of O
and O
response O
to O
drugs O
has O
increased O
significantly. O
MTs O
are O
proteins O
that O
regulate O
the O
transport O
of O
endogenous O
molecules O
and O
xenobiotics O
across O
the O
cell O
membrane. O
In O
mammals, O
two O
super-families O
have O
been O
identified: O
ATP-binding O
cassette O
(ABC) O
and O
solute O
carrier O
(SLC) O
transporters. O
There O
is O
evidence O
that O
MTs O
might O
mediate O
polyamines B-Chemical
(PA) B-Chemical
transport. O
PA B-Chemical
are O
ubiquitous O
polycations O
which O
are O
found O
in O
all O
living O
cells. O
In O
mammalian O
cells, O
three O
major O
PA B-Chemical
are O
synthesised: O
putrescine, B-Chemical
spermidine B-Chemical
and O
spermine; B-Chemical
whilst O
the O
decarboxylated O
arginine B-Chemical
(agmatine) B-Chemical
is O
not O
produced O
by O
mammals O
but O
is O
synthesised O
by O
plants O
and O
bacteria. O
In O
addition, O
research O
in O
the O
PA B-Chemical
field O
suggests O
that O
PA B-Chemical
are O
transported O
into O
cells O
via O
a O
specific O
transporter, O
the O
polyamine B-Chemical
transport O
system(s) O
(PTS). O
Although O
the O
PTS O
has O
not O
been O
fully O
defined, O
there O
is O
evidence O
that O
some O
of O
the O
known O
MTs O
might O
be O
involved O
in O
PA B-Chemical
transport. O
In O
this O
mini O
review, O
eight O
SLC O
transporters O
will O
be O
reviewed O
and O
their O
potential O
to O
mediate O
PA B-Chemical
transport O
in O
human B-Species
cells O
discussed. O
These O
transporters O
are O
SLC22A1, B-Gene
SLC22A2, B-Gene
SLC22A3, B-Gene
SLC47A1, B-Gene
SLC7A1, B-Gene
SLC3A2, B-Gene
SLC12A8A, O
and O
SLC22A16. B-Gene
Preliminary O
data O
from O
our O
laboratory O
have O
revealed O
that O
SLC22A1 B-Gene
might O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
PA B-Chemical
uptake; O
in O
addition O
to O
one O
member O
of O
ABC O
superfamily O
(MDR1 B-Gene
protein) O
might O
also O
mediate O
the O
efflux O
of O
polyamine B-Chemical
like O
molecules. O
