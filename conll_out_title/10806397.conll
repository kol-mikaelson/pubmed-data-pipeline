# Abstract
Acetoacetyl-CoA B-Chemical
specific O
thiolases O
catalyse O
the O
cleavage O
of O
acetoacetyl-CoA B-Chemical
into O
two O
molecules O
of O
acetyl-CoA B-Chemical
and O
the O
synthesis O
(reverse O
reaction) O
of O
acetoacetyl-CoA. B-Chemical
The O
formation O
of O
acetoacetyl-CoA B-Chemical
is O
the O
first O
step O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
ketone B-Chemical
body I-Chemical
synthesis. O
In O
this O
report O
we O
describe O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
novel O
acetoacetyl-CoA B-Gene
thiolase I-Gene
and O
its O
purification O
from O
isolated O
rat B-Species
liver O
peroxisomes O
by O
column O
chromatography. O
The O
enzyme, O
which O
is O
a O
homotetramer O
with O
a O
subunit O
molecular O
mass O
of O
42 O
kDa, O
could O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
cytosolic O
and O
mitochondrial O
acetoacetyl-CoA B-Chemical
thiolases O
by O
its O
chromatographic O
behaviour, O
kinetic O
characteristics O
and O
partial O
internal O
amino-acid O
sequences. O
The O
enzyme O
did O
not O
catalyse O
the O
cleavage O
of O
medium O
or O
long O
chain O
3-oxoacyl-CoAs. B-Chemical
The O
enzyme O
cross-reacted O
with O
polyclonal O
antibodies O
raised O
against O
cytosolic O
acetoacetyl-CoA B-Gene
thiolase. I-Gene
The O
latter O
property O
was O
exploited O
to O
confirm O
the O
peroxisomal O
localization O
of O
the O
novel O
thiolase O
in O
subcellular O
fractionation O
experiments. O
The O
peroxisomal O
acetoacetyl-CoA B-Gene
thiolase I-Gene
most O
probably O
catalyses O
the O
first O
reaction O
in O
peroxisomal O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
dolichol B-Chemical
synthesis. O
In O
addition, O
its O
presence O
in O
peroxisomes O
along O
with O
the O
other O
enzymes O
of O
the O
ketogenic O
pathway O
indicates O
that O
the O
ketogenic O
potential O
of O
peroxisomes O
needs O
to O
be O
re-evaluated. O
