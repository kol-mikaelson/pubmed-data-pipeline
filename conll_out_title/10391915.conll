# Abstract
We O
have O
identified O
a O
new O
human B-Species
cDNA, O
L-amino O
acid O
transporter-2 O
(LAT-2), O
that O
induces O
a O
system O
L O
transport O
activity O
with O
4F2hc B-Gene
(the O
heavy O
chain O
of O
the O
surface O
antigen O
4F2, B-Gene
also O
named O
CD98) B-Gene
in O
oocytes. O
Human B-Species
LAT-2 O
is O
the O
fourth O
member O
of O
the O
family O
of O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
that O
are O
subunits O
of O
4F2hc. B-Gene
The O
amino O
acid O
transport O
activity O
induced O
by O
the O
co-expression O
of O
4F2hc B-Gene
and O
LAT-2 O
was O
sodium-independent O
and O
showed O
broad O
specificity O
for O
small O
and O
large O
zwitterionic O
amino O
acids, O
as O
well O
as O
bulky O
analogs O
(e.g. O
BCH B-Chemical
(2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic B-Chemical
acid)). I-Chemical
This O
transport O
activity O
was O
highly O
trans-stimulated, O
suggesting O
an O
exchanger O
mechanism O
of O
transport. O
Expression O
of O
tagged O
N-myc-LAT-2 O
alone O
in O
oocytes O
did O
not O
induce O
amino O
acid O
transport, O
and O
the O
protein O
had O
an O
intracellular O
location. O
Co-expression O
of O
N-myc-LAT-2 O
and O
4F2hc B-Gene
gave O
amino O
acid O
transport O
induction O
and O
expression O
of O
N-myc-LAT-2 O
at O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
of O
the O
oocytes. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
LAT-2 O
is O
an O
additional O
member O
of O
the O
family O
of O
4F2 B-Gene
light O
chain O
subunits, O
which O
associates O
with O
4F2hc B-Gene
to O
express O
a O
system O
L O
transport O
activity O
with O
broad O
specificity O
for O
zwitterionic O
amino O
acids. O
Human B-Species
LAT-2 O
mRNA O
is O
expressed O
in O
kidney O
>>> O
placenta O
>> O
brain, O
liver O
> O
spleen, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
heart, O
small O
intestine, O
and O
lung. O
Human B-Species
LAT-2 O
gene O
localizes O
at O
chromosome O
14q11.2-13 O
(13 O
cR O
or O
approximately O
286 O
kb O
from O
marker O
D14S1349). O
The O
high O
expression O
of O
LAT-2 O
mRNA O
in O
epithelial O
cells O
of O
proximal O
tubules, O
the O
basolateral O
location O
of O
4F2hc B-Gene
in O
these O
cells, O
and O
the O
amino O
acid O
transport O
activity O
of O
LAT-2 O
suggest O
that O
this O
transporter O
contributes O
to O
the O
renal O
reabsorption O
of O
neutral O
amino O
acids O
in O
the O
basolateral O
domain O
of O
epithelial O
proximal O
