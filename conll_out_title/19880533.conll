# Abstract
The O
haem B-Chemical
oxygenase-1-biliverdin O
reductase O
system O
degrades O
haem B-Chemical
and O
generates O
biliverdin B-Chemical
and O
bilirubin, B-Chemical
both O
of O
which O
possess O
antioxidant O
and O
anti-inflammatory O
properties. O
Biliverdin B-Chemical
and O
bilirubin B-Chemical
are O
protective O
in O
intestinal B-Disease
injury I-Disease
models, O
but O
little O
is O
known O
about O
their O
generation O
and O
fate O
in O
the O
intestine. O
In O
the O
present O
work, O
an O
in O
vitro O
intestinal O
epithelial O
cell O
model, O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells, O
were O
exposed O
to O
haem B-Chemical
from O
either O
the O
apical O
or O
the O
basolateral O
side, O
and O
bile O
pigment O
generation O
and O
transport O
were O
measured O
spectrophotometrically O
and O
with O
high-pressure O
liquid O
chromatography. O
The O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
generated O
bilirubin B-Chemical
and O
bilirubin B-Chemical
glucuronides I-Chemical
upon O
exposure O
to O
haem. B-Chemical
Bilirubin B-Chemical
appeared O
predominantly O
in O
the O
apical O
medium O
regardless O
of O
the O
side O
to O
which O
haem B-Chemical
was O
applied. O
In O
contrast O
to O
an O
earlier O
report, O
significant O
bidirectional O
haem B-Chemical
transport O
was O
not O
observed. O
We O
conclude O
that O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
metabolize O
haem B-Chemical
and O
export O
its O
metabolic O
product, O
bilirubin, B-Chemical
principally O
to O
the O
lumen, O
where O
it O
may O
exert O
antioxidant O
and O
anti-inflammatory O
functions. O
