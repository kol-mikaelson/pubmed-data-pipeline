# Abstract
Human B-Species
brain O
short B-Gene
chain I-Gene
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(SCHAD) B-Gene
was O
found O
to O
catalyze O
the O
oxidation O
of O
17beta-estradiol B-Chemical
and O
dihydroandrosterone B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
alcohols. B-Chemical
Mitochondria O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
the O

of O
this O
NAD+-dependent O

cells, O
although O
its O
primary O
structure O
is O
identical O
to O
an O

reportedly O
associated O
with O
the O

This O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation O
enzyme O
was O
identified O
as O
a O
novel O
17beta-hydroxysteroid B-Gene

responsible O
for O
the O
inactivation O
of O

The O
catalytic O

of O
the O

was O
estimated O

The O

this O

the O

As O
a O
result, O
the O
human B-Species

a O

enzyme, O
appears O
to O
function O

Because O
the O

human B-Species
brain O

it O
