# Abstract
We O
describe O
here O
and O
partially O
characterize O
a O
Ca(2+)-independent O
phospholipase B-Gene
A2 I-Gene
that O
acts O
on O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
in O
normal O
human B-Species
peripheral O
blood O
neutrophils. O
Neutrophils O
incubated O
with O
myo-[3H]inositol B-Chemical
to O
form O
[3H]phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
and O
then O
stimulated O
with O
the O
calcium B-Chemical
ionophore O
A23187 B-Chemical
produced O
[3H]lysophosphatidylinositol. B-Chemical
This O
deacylation O
was O
further O
characterized O
in O
cell O
sonicates O
by O
the O
specific O
release O
of O
[3H]arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
from O
exogenous O
[1-14C]stearoyl-2-[3H]arachidonyl-phosphatidylinositol. B-Chemical
This O
phospholipase B-Gene
A2 I-Gene
is O
Ca2+ B-Gene
independent, O
retaining O
full O
activity O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
10 O
mM O
EDTA, B-Chemical
and O
is O
optimally O
active O
at O
alkaline O
pH O
(pH O
9). O
A O
phosphatidylinositol-hydrolyzing O
phospholipase O
C O
activity O
was O
characterized O
by O
the O
production O
of O
[3H]- B-Chemical
[14C]-diglycerides. I-Chemical
This O
phospholipase O
C O
activity O
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
exogenous O
Ca2+ B-Gene
and O
is O
optimally O
active O
at O
neutral O
pH O
(pH O
7.5). O
The O
lipoxygenase O
cyclooxygenase O
inhibitors O
eicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
nordihydroguaiaretic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
the O
calmodulin B-Gene
antagonist O
trifluoperazine B-Chemical
were O
the O
only O
compounds O
tested O
that O
showed O
significant O
inhibition O
of O
phospholipase B-Gene
A2 I-Gene
activity. O
However, O
none O
of O
these O
phosphatidylinositol-hydrolyzing O
phospholipase B-Gene
A2 I-Gene
inhibitory O
compounds O
resulted O
in O
the O
accumulation O
of O
any O
radiolabeled O
diglyceride, B-Chemical
monoglyceride, B-Chemical
or O
phosphatidic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
intermediates. O
Following O
subcellular O
fractionation O
on O
sucrose B-Chemical
density O
gradients, O
it O
was O
found O
that O
the O
plasma O
membrane-enriched O
fractions O
contained O
the O
highest O
specific O
activity O
for O
phospholipase B-Gene
A2; I-Gene
however, O
the O
cytosolic O
fraction O
contained O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
total O
phospholipase B-Gene
A2 I-Gene
activity. O
Furthermore, O
when O
neutrophils O
were O
first O
exposed O
to O
several O
agents, O
including O
lipopolysaccharide, B-Chemical
phorbol B-Chemical
myristate I-Chemical
acetate, I-Chemical
or O
N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl- B-Chemical
phenylalanine, I-Chemical
and O
then O
subfractionated, O
there O
was O
a O
significant O
translocation O
of O
the O
enzyme O
activity O
from O
the O
cytosolic O
fraction O
to O
the O
membrane-enriched O
fractions. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
this O
Ca(2+)-independent, O
phosphatidylinositol-hydrolyzing O
phospholipase B-Gene
A2 I-Gene
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
early O
cell O
activation, O
providing O
free O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
for O
subsequent O
metabolism O
into O
biologically O
active O
eicosanoids. B-Chemical
