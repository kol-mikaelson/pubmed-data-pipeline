Renal O
Na(+)-glucose O
cotransporters. O

# Abstract
In O
humans, B-Species
the O
kidneys O
filter O
approximately O
180 O
g O
of O
D-glucose B-Chemical
from O
plasma O
each O
day, O
and O
this O
is O
normally O
reabsorbed O
in O
the O
proximal O
tubules. O
Although O
the O
mechanism O
of O
reabsorption O
is O
well O
understood, O
Na(+)-glucose O
cotransport O
across O
the O
brush-border O
membrane O
and O
facilitated O
diffusion O
across O
the O
basolateral O
membrane, O
questions O
remain O
about O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
genes O
responsible O
for O
cotransport O
across O
the O
brush O
border. O
Genetic O
studies O
suggest O
that O
two O
different O
genes O
regulate O
Na(+)-glucose O
cotransport, O
and O
there O
is O
evidence O
from O
animal O
studies O
to O
suggest O
that O
the O
major O
bulk O
of O
sugar B-Chemical
is O
reabsorbed O
in O
the O
convoluted O
proximal O
tubule O
by O
a O
low-affinity, O
high-capacity O
transporter O
and O
that O
the O
remainder O
is O
absorbed O
in O
the O
straight O
proximal O
tubule O
by O
a O
high-affinity, O
low-capacity O
transporter. O
There O
are O
at O
least O
three O
different O
candidates O
for O
these O
human B-Species
renal O
Na(+)-glucose O
cotransporters. O
This O
review O
will O
focus O
on O
the O
structure-function O
relationships O
of O
these O
three O
transporters, O
SGLT1, O
SGLT2, O
and O
SGLT3. O
