# Abstract
Little O

of O
the O
post-absorptive, O
metabolic O
fate O
of O
gamma-tocopherol, B-Chemical
the O
major O
form O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical

The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
extent O
of O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
2,7, B-Chemical
8-trimethyl-2-(beta-carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychroman I-Chemical
(gamma-CEHC), B-Chemical
a O
recently O
identified O
metabolite O
of O
gamma-tocopherol. B-Chemical
A O
method O
for O
measurement O
of O
urinary O
gamma-CEHC B-Chemical
was O
developed, O
using O
gas O
chromatography-mass O
spectrometry O
(GC-MS) O
with O
a O
deuterated O
internal O
standard, O
2,7,8-trimethyl-2-(beta-carboxyethyl)-(3, B-Chemical
4-2H2)-6-hydroxychroman I-Chemical
(d2-gamma-CEHC). B-Chemical
This O
standard O
was O
synthesized O
by O
dehydrogenation O
of O
6-acetyl-gamma-CEHC B-Chemical
followed O
by O
deuteration O
of O
the O
resulting O
3,4-double O
bond. O
The O
use O
of O
d2-gamma-CEHC B-Chemical
resulted O
in O
accurate O
determinations O
of O
the O
concentration O
of O
d0-gamma-CEHC B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
urine. O
Urine O
samples O
containing O
added O
d2-gamma-CEHC B-Chemical
were O
treated O
with O
beta-glucuronidase, B-Gene
extracted O
with O
an O
organic O
solvent, O
and O
analyzed O
by O
GC-MS. O
Analysis O
of O
24-h O
urine O
pools O
from O
healthy O
subjects O
revealed O
gamma-CEHC B-Chemical
concentrations, O
normalized O
against O
creatinine, B-Chemical
ranging O
from O

These O
results O

gamma-CEHC B-Chemical
in O

by O
glucuronide B-Chemical

and O
urinary O
excretion, O
is O
a O
