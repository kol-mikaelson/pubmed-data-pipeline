# Abstract
Overexpression O
of O
the O
zinc O
enzyme O
carbonic O
anhydrase O
(CA; O
EC O
) O
XII O
is O
observed O
in O
certain O
human B-Species
cancers. B-Disease
This O
bitopic O
membrane O
protein O
contains O
an O
N-terminal O
extracellular O
catalytic O
domain, O
a O
membrane-spanning O
alpha-helix, O
and O
a O
small O
intracellular O
C-terminal O
domain. O
We O
have O
determined O
the O
three-dimensional O
structure O
of O
the O
extracellular O
catalytic O
domain O
of O
human B-Species
CA B-Gene
XII I-Gene
by O
x-ray O

resolution. O
The O
structure O
reveals O
a O
prototypical O
CA O
fold; O
however, O
two O
CA B-Gene
XII I-Gene
domains O
associate O
to O
form O
an O
isologous O
dimer, O
an O
observation O
that O
is O
confirmed O
by O
studies O
of O
the O
enzyme O
in O
solution. O
The O
identification O
of O
signature O
GXXXG O
and O
GXXXS O
motifs O
in O
the O
transmembrane O
sequence O
that O
facilitate O
helix-helix O
association O
is O
additionally O
consistent O
with O
dimeric O
architecture. O
The O
dimer O
interface O
is O
situated O
so O
that O
the O
active O
site O
clefts O
of O
each O
monomer O
are O
clearly O
exposed O
on O
one O
face O
of O
the O
dimer, O
and O
the O
C O
termini O
are O
located O
together O
on O
the O
opposite O
face O
of O
the O
dimer O
to O
facilitate O
membrane O
interaction. O
The O
amino O

composition O
of O
the O
active-site O
cleft O
closely O
resembles O
that O
of O
the O
other O
CA O
isozymes O
in O
the O
immediate O
vicinity O
of O
the O
catalytic O
zinc O
ion, O
but O
differs O
in O
the O
region O
of O
the O
nearby O
alpha-helical O
"130's O
segment." O
The O
structure O
of O
the O
CA O
XII-acetazolamide O
complex O
is O
also O
reported O

1.50-A O
resolution, O
and O
prospects O
for O
the O
design O
of O
CA O
XII-specific O
