# Abstract
The O
primary O

gene O
(GSR) B-Gene
was O
determined O
by O
genomic O
cloning. O
The O
gene O
structure O
of O
human B-Species
GSR B-Gene
spans O
50 O

consists O
of O
13 O
exons, O
and O
was O
found O
to O
be O
highly O

gene. O
The O
coding O
sequence O
of O
human B-Species
GSR B-Gene
resides O
on O
all O
13 O
