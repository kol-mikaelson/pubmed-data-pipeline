# Title
Endocannabinoid B-Chemical
transport O
revisited. O

# Abstract
Endocannabinoids B-Chemical
are O
arachidonic O
acid-derived O
endogenous O
lipids B-Chemical
that O
activate O
the O
endocannabinoid B-Chemical
system O
which O
plays O
a O
major O
role O
in O
health O
and O
disease. O
The O
primary O
endocannabinoids B-Chemical
are O
anandamide B-Chemical
(AEA, B-Chemical
N-arachidonoylethanolamine) B-Chemical
and O
2-arachidonoyl B-Chemical
glycerol. I-Chemical
While O
their O
biosynthesis O
and O
metabolism O
have O
been O
studied O
in O
detail, O
it O
remains O
unclear O
how O
endocannabinoids B-Chemical
are O
transported O
across O
the O
cell O
membrane. O
In O
this O
review, O
we O
critically O
discuss O
the O
different O
models O
of O
endocannabinoid B-Chemical
trafficking, O
focusing O
on O
AEA B-Chemical
cellular O
uptake O
which O
is O
best O
studied. O
The O
evolution O
of O
the O
current O
knowledge O
obtained O
with O
different O
AEA B-Chemical
transport O
inhibitors O
is O
reviewed O
and O
the O
confusions O
caused O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
their O
specificity O
discussed. O
A O
comparative O
summary O
of O
the O
most O
important O
AEA B-Chemical
uptake O
inhibitors O
and O
the O
studies O
involving O
their O
use O
is O
provided. O
Based O
on O
a O
comprehensive O
literature O
analysis, O
we O
propose O
a O
model O
of O
facilitated O
AEA B-Chemical
membrane O
transport O
followed O
by O
intracellular O
shuttling O
and O
sequestration. O
We O
conclude O
that O
novel O
and O
more O
specific O
probes O
will O
be O
essential O
to O
identify O
the O
missing O
targets O
involved O
in O
endocannabinoid B-Chemical
membrane O
transport. O
