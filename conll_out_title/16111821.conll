# Abstract
3-Hydroxyglutaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(3HGA) B-Chemical
accumulates O
in O
the O
inherited O
neurometabolic B-Disease
disorder I-Disease
known O
as O
glutaryl-CoA B-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
The O
disease O
is O
clinically O
characterized O
by O
severe O
neurological B-Disease
symptoms, I-Disease
frontotemporal B-Disease
atrophy I-Disease
and O
striatum B-Disease
degeneration. I-Disease
Because O
of O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
the O
brain B-Disease
damage I-Disease
in O
glutaryl-CoA B-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
not O
completed O
clear, O
we O
investigated O
the O
in O
vitro O
effect O
of O
3HGA B-Chemical
(0.01-5.0mM) O
on O
critical O
enzyme O
activities O
of O
energy O
metabolism, O
including O
the O
respiratory O
chain O
complexes B-Chemical
I-V, I-Chemical
creatine O
kinase O
isoforms O
and O
Na(+),K(+)-ATPase O
in O
cerebral O
cortex O
and O
striatum O
from O
30-day-old O
rats. B-Species
Complex O
II O
activity O
was O
also O
studied O
in O
rat B-Species
C6-glioma B-CellLine
cells O
exposed O
to O
3HGA. B-Chemical
The O
effect O
of O
3HGA B-Chemical
was O
further O
investigated O
on O
the O
rate O
of O
oxygen B-Chemical
consumption O
in O
mitochondria O
from O
rat B-Species
cerebrum. O
We O
observed O
that O
1.0mM O
3HGA B-Chemical
significantly O
inhibited O
complex O
II O
in O
cerebral O
cortex O
and O
C6 B-CellLine
cells O
but O
not O
the O
other O
activities O
of O
the O
respiratory O
chain O
complexes. O
Creatine O
kinase O
isoforms O
and O
Na(+),K(+)-ATPase O
were O
also O
not O
affected O
by O
the O
acid. O
Furthermore, O
no O
inhibition O
of O
complex O
II O
activity O
occurred O
when O
mitochondrial O
preparations O
from O
cerebral O
cortex O
or O
striatum O
homogenates O
were O
used. O
In O
addition, O
3HGA B-Chemical
significantly O
lowered O
the O
respiratory O
control O
ratio O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
glutamate B-Chemical
malate B-Chemical
and O
succinate B-Chemical
under O
stressful O
conditions O
or O
when O
mitochondria O
were O
permeabilized O
with O
digitonin. B-Chemical
Since O
3HGA B-Chemical
stimulated O
oxygen B-Chemical
consumption O
in O
state O
IV O
and O
compromised O
ATP B-Chemical
formation, O
it O
can O
be O
presumed O
that O
this O
organic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
might O
act O
as O
an O
endogenous O
uncoupler B-Chemical
of O
mitochondria O
respiration. O
Finally, O
we O
observed O
that O
3HGA B-Chemical
changed O
C6 B-CellLine
cell O
morphology O
from O
a O
round O
flat O
to O
a O
spindle-differentiated O
shape, O
but O
did O
not O
alter O
cell O
viability O
neither O
induced O
apoptosis. O
The O
data O
provide O
evidence O
that O
3HGA B-Chemical
provokes O
a O
moderate O
impairment B-Disease
of I-Disease
brain I-Disease
energy I-Disease
metabolism I-Disease
and O
do O
not O
support O
the O
view O
that O
3HGA-induced O
energy O
failure O
would O
solely O
explain O
the O
characteristic O
brain B-Disease
degeneration I-Disease
observed O
in O
glutaryl-CoA B-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
patients. B-Species
