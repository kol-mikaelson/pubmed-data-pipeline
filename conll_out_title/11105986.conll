# Abstract
Efflux O
transport O
of O
estrogens O
such O
as O
estrone-3-sulfate B-Chemical
(E1S), B-Chemical
and O
estrone B-Chemical
(E1) B-Chemical
across O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
(BBB) O
was O
evaluated O
using O
the O
Brain O
Efflux O
Index O
(BEI) O
method. O
The O
apparent O

efflux O

The O

after O

significant O
amounts O
of O
[3H]E1S B-Chemical
were O
found O
in O
the O
jugular O

plasma, O
providing O
direct O
evidence O
that O
most O
of O
[3H]E1S B-Chemical
is O
transported O
from O
brain O
across O
the O

in O
intact O
form. O
To O
compare O
the O

of O

with O
that O
of O

E1S B-Chemical
and O
E1 B-Chemical
was O
estimated O
using O
the O
brain O

method. O
The O
apparent O

[3H]E1S B-Chemical

By O
contrast, O
the O

The O
E1S B-Chemical
efflux O

inhibited O
by O
more O

coadministration O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(taurocholate, B-Chemical

cholate), B-Chemical
and O
organic O
anions O
(sulfobromophthalein, B-Chemical
and O
probenecid), B-Chemical
whereas O
other O
organic O
anions O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
E1S B-Chemical
efflux O
transport. O
The O
[3H]E1S B-Chemical
efflux O
was O
significantly O
reduced O
by O
48.6% O
after O
preadministration O
of O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
E1S B-Chemical
is O
transported O
from O
brain O
to O
the O
circulating O
blood O
across O
the O
BBB O
via O
a O
carrier-mediated O
efflux O

system. O
