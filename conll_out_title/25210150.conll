# Abstract
In O
addition O
to O
their O
classical O
roles O
as O
detergents O
to O
aid O
in O
the O
process O
of O
digestion, O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
have O
been O
identified O
as O
important O
signaling O
molecules O
that O
function O
through O
various O
nuclear O
and O
G O
protein-coupled O
receptors O
to O
regulate O
a O
myriad O
of O
cellular O
and O
molecular O
functions O
across O
both O
metabolic O
and O
nonmetabolic O
pathways. O
Signaling O
via O
these O
pathways O
will O
vary O
depending O
on O
the O
tissue O
and O
the O
concentration O
and O
chemical O
structure O
of O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
species. O
Important O
determinants O
of O
the O
size O
and O
composition O
of O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
pool O
are O
their O
efficient O
enterohepatic O
recirculation, O
their O
host O
and O
microbial O
metabolism, O
and O
the O
homeostatic O
feedback O
mechanisms O
connecting O
hepatocytes, O
enterocytes, O
and O
the O
luminal O
microbiota. O
This O
review O
focuses O
on O
the O
mammalian O
intestine, O
discussing O
the O
physiology O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transport, O
the O
metabolism O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
in O
the O
gut, O
and O
new O
developments O
in O
our O
understanding O
of O
how O
intestinal O
metabolism, O
particularly O
by O
the O
gut O
microbiota, O
affects O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
signaling. O
