# Abstract
Acyl-coenzyme O
A O
synthetases O
(ACSs) O
catalyze O
the O
fundamental, O
initial O
reaction O
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism. O
"Activation" O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
by O
thioesterification O
to O
CoA B-Chemical
allows O
their O
participation O
in O
both O
anabolic O
and O
catabolic O
pathways. O
The O
availability O
of O
the O
sequenced O
human B-Species
genome O
has O
facilitated O
the O
investigation O
of O
the O
number O
of O
ACS B-Gene
genes O
present. O
Using O
two O
conserved O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
motifs O
to O
probe O
human B-Species
DNA O
databases, O
26 O
ACS B-Gene
family O
genes O
proteins O
were O
identified. O
ACS B-Gene
activity O
in O
either O
humans B-Species
or O
rodents O
was O
demonstrated O
previously O
for O
20 O
proteins, O
but O
6 O
remain O
candidate O
ACSs. O
For O
two O
candidates, O
cDNA O
was O
cloned, O
protein O
was O
expressed O
in O
COS-1 B-CellLine
cells, O
and O
ACS B-Gene
activity O
was O
detected. O
Amino O
acid O
sequence O
similarities O
were O
used O
to O
assign O
enzymes O
into O
subfamilies, O
and O
subfamily O
assignments O
were O
consistent O
with O
acyl O
chain O
length O
preference. O
Four O
of O
the O
26 O
proteins O
did O
not O
fit O
into O
a O
subfamily, O
and O
bootstrap O
analysis O
of O
phylograms O
was O
consistent O
with O
evolutionary O
divergence. O
Three O
additional O
conserved O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
motifs O
were O
identified O
that O
likely O
have O
functional O
or O
structural O
roles. O
The O
existence O
of O
many O
ACSs O
suggests O
that O
each O
plays O
a O
unique O
role, O
directing O
the O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
product O
to O
a O
specific O
metabolic O
fate. O
Knowing O
the O
full O
complement O
of O
ACS B-Gene
genes O
in O
the O
human B-Species
genome O
will O
facilitate O
future O
studies O
to O
characterize O
their O
specific O
biological O
functions. O
