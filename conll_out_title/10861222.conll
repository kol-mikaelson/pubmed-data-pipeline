# Abstract
Choline O
acetyltransferase O
synthesizes O
acetylcholine B-Chemical
in O
cholinergic O
neurons O
and, O
in O
humans, B-Species
may O
be O
produced O
in O
82- O
and O
69-kDa O
forms. O
In O
this O
study, O
recombinant O
choline O
acetyltransferase O
from O
baculovirus O
and O
bacterial O
expression O
systems O
was O
used O
to O
identify O
protein O
isoforms O
by O
two-dimensional O
SDS B-Chemical
PAGE O
and O
as O
substrate O
for O
protein O
kinases. O
Whereas O
hexa-histidine-tagged O
82- O
and O
69-kDa O
enzymes O
did O
not O
resolve O
as O
individual O
isoforms O
on O
two-dimensional O
gels, O
separation O
of O
wild-type O
choline O
acetyltransferase O
expressed O

revealed O
at O

nine O
isoforms O
for O
the O
69-kDa O
enzyme O
and O
at O
least O
six O
isoforms O
for O
the O
82-kDa O
enzyme. O
Non-phosphorylated O
wild-type O
choline O
acetyltransferase O
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species

yielded O
six O
(69 O
kDa) O
and O
four O
isoforms O
(82 O
kDa) O
respectively. O
Immunofluorescent O

enzyme O
showed O
differential O
subcellular O

with O
the O
69-kDa O
enzyme O
localized O

plasma O
membrane O
and O
the O
82-kDa O
enzyme O

cytoplasmic O
at O
24 O
h. O
By O
64 O
h, O
the O
69-kDa O
form O
was O
in O
cytoplasm O
and O
the O
82-kDa O
form O
was O
only O
present O
in O
nucleus. O
Studies O
in O
vitro O
showed O
that O
recombinant O
69-kDa O
enzyme O
was O
a O
substrate O
for O
protein B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
C I-Gene
(PKC), B-Gene
casein O
kinase O
II O
(CK2) O
and O
alpha-calcium O
calmodulin-dependent O
protein O
kinase O
II O
(alpha-CaM O
kinase), O
but O
not O
for O
cAMP-dependent O
protein O
kinase O
(PKA); O
phosphorylation O
by O
PKC B-Gene
and O
CK2 O
enhanced O
enzyme O
activity. O
The O
82-kDa O
enzyme O
was O
a O
substrate O
for O
PKC B-Gene
and O
CK2 O
but O
not O
for O
PKA O
or O
alpha-CaM O
kinase, O
with O
only O
PKC B-Gene
yielding O
increased O
enzyme O
activity. O
Dephosphorylation O
of O
both O
forms O
of O
enzyme O
by O
alkaline O
phosphatase O
decreased O
enzymic O
activity. O
These O
studies O
are O
of O
functional O
significance O
as O
they O
report O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
phosphorylation O
enhances O
choline O
acetyltransferase O
catalytic O
activity. O
