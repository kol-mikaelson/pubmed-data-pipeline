# Abstract
Non-insulin-dependent B-Disease
diabetes I-Disease
mellitus I-Disease
(NIDDM) B-Disease
is O
a O
multifactoral O
disease O
with O
both O
environmental O
and O
genetics O
causes. O
Genome-wide O
screening O
procedures O
have O
identified O
several O
susceptibility O
loci O
for O
NIDDM B-Disease
within O
the O
human B-Species
genome. O
We O
describe O
the O
cloning O
of O
a O
putative O
sugar O
transporter O
that O
has O
been O
localized O
to O
human B-Species
chromosome O
20q12-q13.1, O
one O
of O
the O
genomic O
loci O
associated O
with O
NIDDM. B-Disease
Because O
of O
the O
strong O
resemblance O
of O
this O
novel O
protein O
to O
members O
of O
the O
mammalian O
facilitative O
glucose B-Chemical
transporter O
family O
(GLUT), O
we O
refer O
to O
the O
protein O
as O
GLUT10 B-Gene
(HGMW-approved O
gene O
symbol O
SLC2A10). B-Gene
GLUT10 B-Gene
contains O
541 O
amino O
acids O
with O
several O
glucose B-Chemical
transporter O
sequence O
motifs O
and O
amino O
acids O
essential O
for O
glucose B-Chemical
transport O
function. O
In O
addition, O
secondary O
structure O
analysis O
of O
GLUT10 B-Gene
predicts O
12 O
putative O
transmembrane O
domains, O
a O
hallmark O
structure O
of O
the O
GLUT O
family. O
The O
tissue O
distribution O
of O
GLUT10 B-Gene
was O
determined O
by O
Northern O
analysis, O
which O
revealed O
highest O
levels O
of O
expression O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
pancreas. O
From O
these O
data, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
chromosomal O
localization, O
tissue O
distribution, O
and O
predicted O
function O
make O
GLUT10 B-Gene
an O
excellent O
candidate O
for O
a O

gene O
involved O
in O
NIDDM. B-Disease
