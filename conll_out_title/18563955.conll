In O

statins O
simvastatin, B-Chemical
lovastatin, B-Chemical
fluvastatin B-Chemical

Simvastatin B-Chemical
and O
lovastatin B-Chemical
are O
mainly O
metabolized O
by O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) I-Gene
3A, I-Gene
fluvastatin B-Chemical
is O
metabolized O
by O
CYP2C9, B-Gene
and O
pravastatin B-Chemical
is O
excreted O
largely O
unchanged. O
Several O

can O
influence O
the O
disposition O
of O

e.g. O
the O

Although O

Ciclosporin B-Chemical

Ciclosporin B-Chemical

but O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
seems O
to O
carry O
a O

other O
statins. O
Inhibitors O

Understanding O

On O
the O
pharmacokinetic O
basis, O
fluvastatin B-Chemical

can O
be O
better O

simvastatin B-Chemical
