the O
transport O

of O
the O
water-soluble O
vitamin O
biotin B-Chemical
across O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
(BLM) O
of O
rat B-Species
intestine, O
i.e. O
the O
exit O
of O
biotin B-Chemical
from O
rat B-Species
enterocyte, O
were O
examined O
using O
established O
BLM O
vesicles O
(BLMV) O
techniques. O
Results O
of O
osmolarity O
and O
temperature O
studies O
have O
indicated O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
biotin B-Chemical
taken O
up O
by O
these O
vesicles O
is O
the O
result O
of O
transport O
of O
the O
vitamin O
into O
the O
intravesicular O
spaces, O
with O
little O
membrane O
binding. O
Transport O
of O
biotin B-Chemical
in O
these O
vesicles O
was O
found O
to O
be: O
(1) O
higher O
in O
BLMV O
of O
the O
jejunum O
than O
those O
isolated O
simultaneously O
from O
the O
ileum, O
(2) O
Na(+)-independent O
in O
nature, O
(3) O

Based O
on O
these O
findings, O
it O
is O
concluded O
that O
biotin B-Chemical
transport O
across O
the O
rat B-Species
intestinal O
BLM O
is O
mediated O
via O
a O
specialized O
carrier O
system O
which O
is O
Na(+)-independent, O
transports O
the O
vitamin O
by O
a O
process O
which O
is O
sensitive O
to O
the O
effects O
of O

transport I-Chemical
inhibitors, O
and O
is O
electroneutral O
in O
nature. O
