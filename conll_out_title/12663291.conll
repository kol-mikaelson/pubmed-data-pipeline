# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Proanthocyanidins, B-Chemical
the O
most O
abundant O
polyphenols B-Chemical
in O
chocolate, O
are O
not O
depolymerized O
in O
the O
stomach O
and O
reach O
the O
small O
intestine O
intact, O
where O
they O
are O
hardly O
absorbed O
because O
of O
their O
high O
molecular O
weight. O
In O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo O
studies O
using O
pure O
compounds O
as O
substrates O
suggest O
that O
proanthocyanidins B-Chemical
and O
the O
related O
catechin B-Chemical
monomers O
may O
be O
degraded O
into O
more O
bioavailable O
low-molecular-weight O
phenolic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
by O
the O
microflora O
in O
the O
colon. O
OBJECTIVE: O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
study O
was O
to O
estimate O
the O
amounts O
of O
phenolic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
formed O
by O
the O
microflora O
and O
excreted O
in O
the O
urine O
of O
human B-Species
subjects O
after O
consumption O
of O
polyphenol-rich O
chocolate. O
DESIGN: O
After O
consumption O
of O
a O
polyphenol-free O
diet O
for O
2 O
d O
and O
a O
subsequent O
overnight O
fast, O
11 O
healthy O
subjects O
(7 O
men B-Species
and O
4 O
women) B-Species
consumed O
80 O
g O
chocolate O
containing O
439 O
mg O
proanthocyanidins B-Chemical
and O
147 O
mg O
catechin B-Chemical
monomers. O
All O
urine O
was O
collected O
during O
the O
24 O
h O
before O
chocolate O
consumption O
and O
at O
3, O
6, O
9, O
24, O
and O
48 O
h O
after O
chocolate O
consumption. O
Aromatic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
identified O
in O
urine O
by O
gas O
chromatography-mass O
spectrometry O
and O
were O
quantified O
by O
HPLC-electrospray O
ionization O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry. O
RESULTS: O
Chocolate O
intake O
increased O
the O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
the O
6 O
following O
phenolic B-Chemical
acids: I-Chemical
m-hydroxyphenylpropionic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
ferulic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
m-hydroxyphenylacetic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
vanillic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
m-hydroxybenzoic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
CONCLUSION: O
The O
antioxidant O
and O
biological O
effects O
of O
chocolate O
may O
be O
explained O
not O
solely O
by O
the O
established O
absorption O
of O
catechin B-Chemical
monomers O
but O
also O
by O
the O
absorption O
of O
microbial O
phenolic O
acid O
metabolites. O
