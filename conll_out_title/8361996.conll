# Abstract
The O
immunosuppressant O
cyclosporin, B-Chemical
a O
cyclic B-Chemical
undecapeptide, I-Chemical
is O
metabolized O
to O
more O
than O
30 O
metabolites. O
Cytochrome O
P450IIIA O
enzymes O
located O
in O
liver O
and O
small O
intestine O
are O
responsible O
for O
the O
biotransformation O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolites O
and O
are O
the O
site O
of O
several O
drug O
interactions. O
It O
is O
still O
under O
discussion, O
whether O
the O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
metabolites O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
immunosuppressive O
and O
or O
toxic O
activities O
of O
cyclosporin. B-Chemical
While O
isolated O
metabolites O
show O
not O
more O
than O
10-20% O
of O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
mother O
compound O
in O
vitro, O
metabolite O
combinations O
have O
additive O
and O
synergistic O
effects. O
Isolated O
metabolites O
show O
no O
toxic O
effects O
in O
rat B-Species
models O
while O
there O
is O
an O
association O
between O
metabolite O
blood O

and O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
toxicity B-Disease
in O
several O
clinical O
studies. O
Possible O
mechanisms O
for O
the O
toxic O
effect O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
metabolites O
are O
covalent O
binding O
to O
macromolecules O
in O
liver O
and O
kidney, O
alteration O
of O
the O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
pattern O
in O
liver O
and O
kidney, O
increased O
endothelin O
production O
in O
the O
kidney O
and O
synergistic O
effects O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
combinations O
on O
mesangial O
cells. O
Liver B-Disease
dysfunction I-Disease
leads O
to O
an O
alteration O
of O
the O
metabolite O
patterns O
and O
to O
increased O
concentrations O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
metabolites O
in O
blood. O
In O
conclusion O
there O
is O
evidence O
that O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
metabolites O
may O
contribute O
to O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
toxicity B-Disease
and O
high O
metabolite O
