# Abstract
Mammalian B-Species
peroxisomes O
degrade O
fatty B-Chemical
carboxylates I-Chemical
via O
two O
pathways, O
beta-oxidation O
and, O
as O
shown O
more O
recently, O
alpha-oxidation. O
The O
latter O
process O
consists O
of O
an O
activation O
step, O
followed O
by O
a O
hydroxylation O
at O
position O
2 O
and O
cleavage O
of O
the O
2-hydroxyacyl-CoA, B-Chemical

formyl-CoA B-Chemical
(precursor O

and, O
in O
case O
of O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
as O
substrate, O
pristanal B-Chemical
(precursor O

the O

which O

homologous O
with O
bacterial O
oxalyl-CoA O
decarboxylases, O
will O
be O
discussed. O
With O
regard O
to O
beta-oxidation, O
peroxisomes O
contain O
different O
acyl-CoA O
oxidases, O
multifunctional O
proteins O
and O
thiolases. O
Based O
on O
substrate O
spectra O
and O
stereospecificities O
of O
these O
enzymes, O
a O
model O
was O
proposed O
whereby O
straight O
chain O
and O
branched O
compounds O
are O
degraded O
by O
separate O
pathways. O
The O
biochemical O
findings O
in O
mice B-Species
lacking O
the O
D-specific O
multifunctional O
protein, O
however, O
do O
not O
fully O
support O
this O
model. O
These O
animals, O
together O
with O
the O
Pex5(- B-Gene

mice, B-Species
might O
be O
useful O
to O
pinpoint O
the O
