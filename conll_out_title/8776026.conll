# Abstract
Hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia I-Disease
type I-Disease
I I-Disease
(HTI) B-Disease
(MIM B-Disease
276700) I-Disease
is O
an O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
caused O
by O
deficiency B-Disease
of I-Disease
fumarylacetoacetase I-Disease
(EC B-Disease
3.7.1.2), I-Disease
which O
is O
the O
last O
enzyme O
in O
the O
tyrosine B-Chemical
degradation O
pathway. O
The O
enzyme O
block O
causes O
accumulation O
of O
toxic O
metabolites O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
kidneys, O
which O
are O
the O
organs O
where O
tyrosine B-Chemical
is O
mainly O
degraded. O
The O
disorder O
is O
characterized O
by O
severe O
liver B-Disease
disease, I-Disease
which O
either O
causes O
liver B-Disease
failure I-Disease
in O
infancy O
or O
may O
take O
a O
more O
protracted O
course, O
with O
death B-Disease
often O
occurring O
during O
childhood O
or O
adolescence O
because O
of O
hepatoma B-Disease
development. O
Treatment O
with O
a O
diet O
restricted O
in O
phenylalanine B-Chemical
nd O
tyrosine B-Chemical
does O
not O
prevent O
progression O
of O
the O
liver B-Disease
disease I-Disease
and O
development O
of O
hepatocellular B-Disease
carcinoma. I-Disease
Liver O
transplantation O
was O
previously O
the O
only O
option O
for O
these O
patients. B-Species
Important O
achievements O

studies O
of O
the O

include O
a O

These O
advances O
will O
have O
great O
implications O
for O
our O
understanding O
of O
pathogenetic O
mechanisms, O
which O
is O
the O
