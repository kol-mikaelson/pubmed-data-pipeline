# Abstract
The O
effect O
of O
methylmalonate B-Chemical
(MMA) B-Chemical
on O
mitochondrial O
succinate B-Chemical
oxidation O
has O
received O
great O
attention O
since O
it O
could O
present O
an O
important O

In O
the O
present O
work, O
we O
show O
that O
while O
millimolar O
concentrations O
of O
MMA B-Chemical
inhibit O
succinate-supported O
oxygen B-Chemical
consumption O
by O
isolated O
rat B-Species
brain O
or O

mitochondria, O
there O
is O
no O
effect O
when O
either O
a O
pool O
of O
NADH-linked O
substrates O
or O
N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylendiamine B-Chemical
(TMPD) B-Chemical
ascorbate B-Chemical

used O
as O
electron O

Interestingly, O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
MMA, B-Chemical
but O
not O
of O
malonate, B-Chemical
on O
succinate-supported O
brain O
mitochondrial O

was O
minimized O
when O
nonselective O

In O
addition, O
only O
a O
slight O

of O
MMA B-Chemical
was O
observed O
on O
succinate-supported O

In O
agreement O
with O
these O
observations, O
brain O

experiments O
indicate O
that O
MMA B-Chemical
is O
an O
important O
inhibitor O
of O
succinate B-Chemical
transport O
by O
the O
dicarboxylate B-Chemical
carrier. O
Under O
our O
experimental O
conditions, O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
malonate B-Chemical
production O
in O
MMA-treated O
mitochondria. O
We O
conclude O
that O
MMA B-Chemical
inhibits O
succinate-supported O
mitochondrial O
oxygen B-Chemical
consumption O
by O
interfering O
with O
the O
uptake O
of O
this O
substrate. O
Although O
succinate B-Chemical
generated O
outside O
the O
mitochondria O
is O
probably O
not O
a O
sig-nificant O
contributor O
to O
mitochondrial O
energy O
generation, O
the O
physiopathological O
implications O
of O
MMA-induced O
inhibition O
of O
substrate O
transport O
by O
the O
mitochondrial O
dicarboxylate B-Chemical
carrier O
are O
discussed. O
