# Abstract
Uridine, B-Chemical
a O
pyrimidine B-Chemical
nucleoside I-Chemical
essential O
for O
the O
synthesis O
of O
RNA O
and O
bio-membranes, O
is O
a O
crucial O
element O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
normal O
physiological O
processes O
as O
well O
as O
pathological O
states. O
The O
biological O
effects O
of O
uridine B-Chemical
have O
been O
associated O
with O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
cardio-circulatory O
system, O
at O
the O
reproduction O
level, O
with O
both O
peripheral O
and O
central O
nervous O
system O
modulation O
and O
with O
the O
functionality O
of O
the O
respiratory O
system. O
Furthermore, O
uridine B-Chemical
plays O
a O
role O
at O
the O
clinical O
level O
in O
modulating O
the O
cytotoxic B-Disease
effects O
of O
fluoropyrimidines B-Chemical
in O
both O
normal O
and O
neoplastic O
tissues. O
The O
concentration O
of O
uridine B-Chemical
in O
plasma O
and O
tissues O
is O
tightly O
regulated O
by O
cellular O
transport O
mechanisms O
and O
by O
the O
activity O
of O
uridine B-Chemical
phosphorylase I-Gene
(UPase), B-Gene
responsible O
for O
the O
reversible O
phosphorolysis O
of O
uridine B-Chemical
to O
uracil. O
We O
have O
recently O
completed O
several O
studies O
designed O
to O
define O
the O
mechanisms O
regulating O
UPase B-Gene
expression O
and O
better O
characterize O
the O
multiple O
biological O
effects O
of O
uridine. B-Chemical
Immunohistochemical O
analysis O
and O
co-purification O
studies O
have O
revealed O
the O
association O
of O
UPase B-Gene
with O
the O
cytoskeleton O
and O
the O
cellular O
membrane. O
The O
characterization O
of O
the O
promoter O
region O
of O
UPase B-Gene
has O
indicated O
a O
direct O
regulation O
of O
its O
expression O
by O
the O
tumor B-Disease
suppressor O
gene O
p53. B-Gene
The O
evaluation O
of O
human B-Species
surgical O
specimens O
has O
shown O
elevated O
UPase B-Gene
activity O
in O
tumor B-Disease
tissue O
compared O
to O
paired O
normal O
tissue. O
