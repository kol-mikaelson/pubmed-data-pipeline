# Abstract
The O
previously O
isolated O
cDNA O
encoding O
human B-Species
adenylate O
kinase O
(AK) O
isozyme O
3 O
was O
recently O
renamed O
AK4. B-Gene
Consequently, O
human B-Species
AK3 B-Gene
cDNA O
remains O
to O
be O
identified O
and O
we O
have O
little O
information O
about O
the O
functional O
relationship O
between O
human B-Species
AK3 B-Gene
and O
AK4. B-Gene
In O
pursuit O
of O
the O
physiological O
roles O
of O
both O
the O
AK3 B-Gene
and O
AK4 B-Gene
proteins, O
we O
first O
isolated O
an O
authentic O
human B-Species
AK3 B-Gene
cDNA O
and O
compared O
their O
expression. O
Nucleotide O
sequencing O
revealed O
that O
the O
cDNA O
encoded O
a O
227-amino-acid O
protein, O
with O
a O
deduced O
molecular O
mass O
of O
25.6 O
kDa, O
that O
shares O
greater O
homology O
with O
the O
AK3 B-Gene
cDNAs O
isolated O

bovine B-Species
and O

than O
that O
from O
human. B-Species
We O
named O
the O
isolated O
cDNA O
AK3. B-Gene
Northern-blot O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
AK3 B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
present O
in O
all O
tissues O
examined, O
and O
was O
highly O
expressed O
in O
heart, O
skeletal O
muscle O
and O
liver, O
moderately O
expressed O
in O
pancreas O
and O
kidney, O
and O
weakly O
expressed O
in O
placenta, O
brain O
and O
lung. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
we O
found O
that O
human B-Species
AK4 B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
highly O
expressed O
in O
kidney, O
moderately O
expressed O
in O
heart O
and O
liver O
and O
weakly O
expressed O
in O
brain. O
Western-blot O
analysis O
demonstrated O
expression O
profiles O
of O
AK3 B-Gene
and O
AK4 B-Gene
that O
were O
similar O
to O
their O
mRNA O
expression O
patterns O
in O
