# Abstract
Pyrimidine O
nucleoside B-Chemical
monophosphate O
kinase O
[UMP B-Gene
CMP B-Chemical
kinase I-Gene
(UMP B-Gene
CMPK);EC O
2.7.4.14] O
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
UDP, B-Chemical
CDP, B-Chemical
and O
dCDP, B-Chemical
which O
are O
required O
for O
cellular O
nucleic O
acid O
synthesis. O
Several O
cytidine B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
deoxycytidine B-Chemical
analogues O
are O
important O
anticancer O
and O
antiviral O
drugs. O
These O
drugs O
require O
stepwise O
phosphorylation O
to O
their O
triphosphate O
forms O
to O
exert O
their O
therapeutic O
effects. O
The O
role O
of O
UMP B-Gene
CMPK I-Gene
for O
the O
phosphorylation O
of O
nucleoside B-Chemical
analogues O
has O
been O
indicated. O
Thus, O
we O
cloned O
the O
human B-Species
UMP B-Gene
CMPK I-Gene
gene, O
expressed O
it O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli, I-Species
and O
purified O
it O
to O
homogeneity. O
Its O
kinetic O
properties O
were O
determined. O
UMP B-Gene
and O
CMP B-Chemical
proved O
to O
be O
far O
better O
substrates O
than O
dCMP. B-Chemical
UMP B-Gene
CMPK I-Gene
used O
all O
of O
the O
nucleoside B-Chemical
triphosphates I-Chemical
as O
phosphate B-Chemical
donors, O
with O
ATP B-Chemical
and O
dATP B-Chemical
being O
the O
best O
donors O
and O
CTP B-Chemical
being O
the O
poorest. O
Furthermore, O
UMP B-Gene
CMPK I-Gene
was O
able O
to O
phosphorylate O
all O
of O
the O
deoxycytidine B-Chemical
analogue O
monophosphates B-Chemical
that O
we O
tested. O
The O
relative O
efficiency O
was O
as O
follows: O
arabinofuranosyl-CMP B-Chemical
> O
dCMP B-Chemical
> O
beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thia-CMP B-Chemical
> O
Gemcitabine B-Chemical
monophosphate I-Chemical
> O
beta-D-2',3'-dideoxy-CMP; B-Chemical
beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro-5-fluoro-CMP; B-Chemical
beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thia-CMP B-Chemical
> O
beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-CMP B-Chemical
> O
beta-L-dioxolane-CMP. B-Chemical
By O
comparing O
the O
relative O
V(max) O
K(m) O
values O
of O
D- B-Chemical
and O
L-form B-Chemical
dideoxy-CMP, I-Chemical
we O
showed O
that O
this O
kinase O
lacked O
stereoselectivity. O
Reducing O
agents, O
such O
as O
DTT, B-Chemical
2-mercaptoethanol, B-Chemical
and O
thioredoxin, B-Gene
were O
able O
to O
activate O
this O
enzyme, O
suggesting O
that O
its O
activity O
may O
be O
regulated O
by O
redox O
potential O
in O
vivo. O
UMP B-Gene
CMPK I-Gene
localized O
predominantly O
to O
the O
cytoplasm. O
In O
addition, O
196-amino O
acid O
UMP B-Gene
CMPK I-Gene
was O
the O
actual O
form O
of O
UMP B-Gene
CMPK, I-Gene
rather O
than O
the O
228-amino O
acid O
form O
as O
suggested O
before. O
