# Abstract
In O
conditions O
associated O
with O
high O
serum O
iodothyronine B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
concentrations, O
e.g. O
during O
fetal O
development, O
desulfation O
of O
these O
conjugates O
may O
be O
important O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
thyroid O
hormone O
homeostasis. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
which O
sulfatases O
are O
involved O
in O
this O
process. O
Therefore, O
we O
investigated O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
iodothyronine B-Chemical
sulfates I-Chemical
by O
homogenates O
of O
V79 B-CellLine
cells O
expressing O
the O
human B-Species
arylsulfatases B-Gene
A I-Gene
(ARSA), B-Gene
B O
(ARSB), B-Gene
or O
C O
(ARSC; B-Gene
steroid O
sulfatase), O
as O
well O
as O
tissue O
fractions O
of O
human B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
liver O
and O
placenta. O
We O
found O
that O
only O
the O
microsomal O
fraction O
from O
liver O
and O
placenta O
hydrolyzed O
iodothyronine B-Chemical
sulfates. I-Chemical
Among O
the O
recombinant O
enzymes O
only O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum-associated O
ARSC B-Gene
showed O
activity O
toward O
iodothyronine B-Chemical
sulfates; I-Chemical
the O
soluble O
lysosomal O
ARSA B-Gene
and O
ARSB B-Gene
were O
inactive. O
Recombinant O
ARSC B-Gene
as O
well O
as O
human B-Species
placenta O
microsomes O
hydrolyzed O
iodothyronine B-Chemical
sulfates I-Chemical
with O
a O
substrate O
preference O
for O
3,3'-diiodothyronine B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
(3,3'-T(2)S) B-Chemical
approximately O
T(3) B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
(T(3)S) O
>> O
rT(3)S B-Chemical
approximately O
T(4)S, O
whereas O
human B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
showed O
a O
preference O
for O
3,3'-T(2)S B-Chemical
> O
T(3)S O

rT(3)S B-Chemical
approximately O
T(4)S. O
ARSC B-Gene
and O
the O
tissue O
microsomal O
sulfatases O
were O
all O
characterized O
by O
high O
apparent O
K(m) O
values O
(>50 O
microM) O
for O
3,3'-T(2)S B-Chemical
and O
T(3)S. O
Iodothyronine O
sulfatase O
activity O
determined O
using O
3,3'-T(2)S B-Chemical
as O
a O
substrate O
was O
much O
higher O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
than O
in O
human B-Species
placenta O
microsomes, O
although O
ARSC B-Gene
is O
expressed O
at O
higher O
levels O
in O
human B-Species
placenta O
than O
in O
human B-Species
liver. O
The O
ratio O
of O
estrone B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
to O
T(2)S O
hydrolysis O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
(0.2) O
differed O
largely O
from O
that O
in O
ARSC B-Gene
homogenate O
(80) O
and O
human B-Species
placenta O
microsomes O
(150). O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
ARSC B-Gene
accounts O
for O
the O
relatively O
low O
iodothyronine O
sulfatase O
activity O
of O
human B-Species
placenta, O
and O
that O
additional O
arylsulfatase(s) O
contributes O
to O
the O
high O
iodothyronine O
sulfatase O
activity O
in O
human B-Species
liver. O
Further O
research O
is O
needed O
to O
identify O
these O
iodothyronine O
sulfatases, O
and O
to O
study O
the O
physiological O
importance O
of O
the O
reversible O
sulfation O
of O
iodothyronines B-Chemical
in O
thyroid O
hormone O
metabolism. O
