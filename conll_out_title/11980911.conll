# Abstract
Bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
synthesized O
de O
novo O
in O
the O
liver O
from O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
conjugated O
to O
glycine B-Chemical
or O
taurine B-Chemical
via O
a O
complex O
series O
of O
reactions O
involving O
multiple O
organelles. O
Bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
secreted O
into O
the O
small O
intestine O
are O
efficiently O
reabsorbed O
and O
reutilized. O
Activation O
by O
thioesterification O
to O
CoA B-Chemical
is O
required O
at O
two O
points O
in O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism. O
First, O
3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic O
acid, O
the O
27-carbon O
precursor O
of O
cholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
must O
be O
activated O
to O
its O
CoA B-Chemical
derivative O
before O
side O
chain O
cleavage O
via O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation. O
Second, O
reutilization O
of O
cholate B-Chemical
and O
other O
C24 O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
requires O
reactivation O
prior O
to O
re-conjugation. O
We O
reported O
previously O
that O
homolog O
2 O
of O
very B-Gene
long-chain I-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
synthetase I-Gene
(VLCS) B-Gene
can O
activate O
cholate B-Chemical

We O
now O
show O
that O
this O
enzyme O
also O
activates O
chenodeoxycholate, B-Chemical
the O
secondary O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
deoxycholate B-Chemical
and O
lithocholate, B-Chemical
and O
3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic O
acid. O
In O
contrast, O
VLCS B-Gene
activated O
3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoate, O
but O
did O
not O
utilize O
any O
of O
the O
C24 O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
as O
substrates. O
We O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
primary O
function O
of O
homolog O
2 O
is O
in O
the O
reactivation O
and O
recycling O
of O
C24 O
bile B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
whereas O
VLCS B-Gene
participates O
in O
the O
de O

synthesis O
pathway. O
Results O
of O
in O

hybridization, O
topographic O
orientation, O
and O
inhibition O
studies O
are O
consistent O
with O
the O
proposed O
roles O
of O
these O
enzymes O
in O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism. O
