# Abstract
Metabolic O
changes O
dependent O
upon O
clinical O
conditions O
were O
studied O
in O
an O
eight-month-old O
girl O
with O
propionyl B-Chemical
CoA I-Chemical
carboxylase I-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
Only O
methylcitric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
2-methyl-3-oxovaleric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
were O
detected O
in O
the O
urine O
of O
the O
patient B-Species
under O
clinically O
favorable O
conditions. O
During O
episodes O
of O
clinical O
decompensation, O
she O
excreted O
increased O
amounts O
of O
all O
the O
metabolites O
associated O
with O
this O
disorder. O
Four O

glutaric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
a O
catabolic O

lysine; B-Chemical
3-hydroxyisovaleric B-Chemical

3-methylglutaconic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
catabolic O

of O
leucine; B-Chemical

This O
suggests O
that O
under O
clinically O
favorable O
conditions O
the O
patient B-Species
has O
an O
altered O
propionate B-Chemical
metabolism O
which O
proceeds O
via O
normal O
acetyl B-Chemical
CoA I-Chemical
metabolism O
with O
sufficient O
capacity O
for O
acetyl B-Chemical
CoA I-Chemical
plus O
propionyl B-Chemical
CoA I-Chemical
metabolism. O
When O
the O
production O
of O
propionyl B-Chemical
CoA I-Chemical
exceeds O
the O
metabolic O
capacity, O
however, O
the O
catabolism O
of O
potent O
ketogenic B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical

is O
effectively O
suppressed O
in O
order O
to O
reduce O
acetyl B-Chemical
