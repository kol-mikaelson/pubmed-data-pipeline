# Abstract
Peroxisomes O
are O
essential O
organelles O
exerting O
key O
functions O
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism O
such O
as O
the O
degradation O
of O
very O
long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(VLCFAs). B-Chemical
VLCFAs B-Chemical
accumulate O
in O
X-adrenoleukodystrophy B-Disease
(X-ALD), B-Disease
a O
disease O
caused O
by O
deficiency B-Disease
of I-Disease
the I-Disease
Abcd1 B-Gene
peroxisomal O
transporter. O
Its O
closest O
homologue, O
Abcd2, B-Gene
exhibits O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
functional O
redundancy O
on O
the O
catabolism O
of O
VLCFA, B-Chemical
being O
able O

X-ALD-related O
neurodegeneration B-Disease

In O
the O
search O
for O
specific O
roles O
of O
Abcd2, B-Gene
we O
screened O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
profiles O
in O
organs O
and O
primary O
neurons O
of O
mutant O
knockout O
mice B-Species
lacking O
Abcd2 B-Gene
in O
basal O
conditions B-Disease
and O
under O
dietary O
challenges. O
Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
ABCD2 B-Gene
plays O
a O
role O
in O
the O
degradation O
of O
long-chain O
saturated B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
omega9-monounsaturated I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical

in O
the O
synthesis O

(DHA). B-Chemical
Also, O
we O
demonstrated O

As O
DHA B-Chemical
levels O
are O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
the O
incidence O
of O
Alzheimer's B-Disease
and O
several O
degenerative O
conditions, B-Disease
we O
suggest O
that O
ABCD2 B-Gene
may O
act O
as O
modulator O
modifier O
gene O
and O
therapeutic O
target O
in O
rare O
and O
common O
human B-Species
disorders. O
