# Abstract
Chromosome O
16p13 B-Chromosome
has O
been O
shown O
to O
display O
modest O
linkage O
signals O
for O
mood B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
in O
a O
number O
of O
studies. O
An O
interesting O
candidate O
gene O
in O
this O
region O
is O
the O
adenylate B-Gene
cyclase I-Gene
(AC) I-Gene
type I-Gene
9 I-Gene
gene O
(ADCY9). O
ACs B-Chemical
are O
critical O
in O
neuronal O
signaling, O
and O
perturbation O
of O
brain O
AC O
activity O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
mood B-Disease
disorder I-Disease
postmortem O
brains. O
ACs B-Chemical
may O
also O
act O
as O
targets O
of O
antidepressants. O
Two O
distinct O
length O
transcripts O
for O
the O
ADCY9 O
gene O
have O
been O
reported, O
but O
molecular O
mechanisms O
are O
unknown. O
To O
investigate O
the O
potential O
role O
of O
ADCY9 O
in O
mood B-Disease
disorders, I-Disease
we O
clarified O
alternative O
poly(A) B-Chemical
sites O
for O
the O
two O
mRNA O
species, O
delineated O
the O
exon-intron O
structure, O
and O
screened O
the O
gene O
for O
genetic O
variants. O
The O
two O
transcripts O
encoded O
by O
ADCY9 O
shared O
the O
first O
10 O
exons, O
but O
exon O
11 O
was O
shorter O
in O
one O
of O
the O
mRNA O
species. O
Seven O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms, O
including O
a O
missense O
mutation O
and O
one O
polymorphic O
microsatellite O
repeat O
in O
the O
3'-UTR, O
were O
identified. O
However, O
a O
case-control O
study O
using O
the O
missense O
polymorphism, O
2316A>G B-DNAMutation
(Ile772Met), B-ProteinMutation
and O
the O
tetranucleotide O
repeat O
(TTTA)n O
showed O
no O
significant O
association O
with O
mood B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
in O
Japanese O
samples. O
The O
DNA O
polymorphisms O
detected O
in O
this O
study O
can O
be O
tested O
in O
other O
ethnic O
samples O
and O
or O
other O
psychiatric O
diseases. O
