# Abstract
The O
in O
vitro O
metabolism O
of O
DuP B-Chemical
753, I-Chemical
a O
novel O
nonpeptide O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
antagonist, O
has O
been O
investigated O
in O
incubations O
with O
liver O
slice O
preparations O
from O
rats, B-Species
monkeys B-Species
and O
humans. B-Species
Metabolites O
were O
identified O
by O
HPLC O
MS, O
FAB B-Chemical
MS, O
Cl O
MS, O
and O
or O
1H B-Chemical
NMR. O
In O
the O
rat, B-Species
the O
primary O
route O
of O
metabolism O
was O
oxidative, O
leading O
to O
either O
monohydroxylated O
or O
oxidized O
(carboxylic B-Chemical
acid) I-Chemical
metabolites, O
whereas O
in O
monkeys, B-Species
glucuronidation O
of O
the O
tetrazole B-Chemical
moiety O
predominated. O
An O
equal O
mixture O
of O
both O
oxidized O
and O
glucuronic O
acid-conjugated O
metabolites O
was O
isolated O
from O
incubations O
with O
human B-Species
liver O
slices. O
All O
metabolites O
were O
tested O
in O
an O
in O
vitro O
assay O
to O
determine O
their O
activity O
as O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
antagonists. O
The O
monohydroxylated O
products O
and O
glucuronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
conjugates O
were O
determined O
to O
be O
much O
less O
active O
than O
DuP B-Chemical
753. I-Chemical
Biotransformation O
to O
the O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
however, O
was O
shown O
to O
dramatically O
increase O
the O
activity O
of O
this O
agent. O
The O
in O
vivo O
duration O
of O
action O
of O
DuP B-Chemical
753 I-Chemical
has O
been O
observed O
to O
be O
much O
longer O
in O
the O
rat B-Species
than O
in O
the O
monkey. B-Species
This O
may O
be O
explained, O
at O
least O
in O
part, O
by O
these O
in O
vitro O
metabolism O
studies. O
The O
predominance O
of O
glucuronidation O
observed O
in O
incubations O
with O
monkey B-Species
liver O
slices O
would O
yield O
metabolites O
with O
diminished O
activity O
and O
might O
be O
expected O
to O
shorten O
the O
in O

duration O
of O
DuP B-Chemical
753 I-Chemical
in O
that O
species. O
The O
oxidative O
conversion O
to O
the O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolite, O
along O
with O
the O
low O
level O
of O
glucuronidation O
observed O
in O
incubations O
with O
rat B-Species
liver O
slices, O
may O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
prolonged O
duration O
observed O
in O

in O
the O
rat. B-Species
