agmatinase. B-Gene

# Abstract
Arginine B-Chemical
decarboxylase I-Gene
(ADC) B-Gene
and O
agmatinase B-Gene
are O
part O
of O
an O
operon O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli, I-Species
which O
constitutes O
the O
primary O
pathway O
of O
polyamine B-Chemical
synthesis O
from O
arginine. B-Chemical
This O
pathway O
is O
also O
known O
to O
exist O
in O
plants, O
but O
until O
recently, O
neither O
agmatine B-Chemical
nor O
ADC, B-Gene
the O
enzyme O
that O
synthesizes O
it, O
nor O
agmatinase B-Gene
the O
enzyme O
that O
is O
responsible O
for O
conversion O
of O
agmatine B-Chemical
to O
putrescine, B-Chemical
were O
known O
to O
exist O
in O
man O
or O
other O
mammals. O
We O
describe O
here O
the O
cloning O
of O
the O
agmatinase B-Gene
gene O
and O
the O
tissue O
distribution O
of O
its O
transcription O
product. O
Human B-Species
agmatinase B-Gene
contains O
352 O
amino O
acid O
residues O
and O
has O
a O
calculated O
molecular O
weight O
of O
37,688 O
kDa. O
It O
has O
56% O
similarity O
to O
E. B-Species
coli I-Species
agmatinase B-Gene
and O
42% O
similarity O
to O
human B-Species
arginases O
I O
and O
II O
and O
shares O
highly O
conserved O
substrate-binding O
domains O
with O
these O
well-characterized O
enzymes. O
