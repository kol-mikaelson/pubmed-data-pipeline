# Abstract
We O
have O
isolated O
two O
novel O
genes, O
designated O
DSCR5 B-Gene
and O
DSCR6, B-Gene
from O
the O
Down B-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
critical O
region O
(DSCR) O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
21q22.2 I-Chromosome
which O
has O
been O
defined O
as O
minimal O
overlapping O
region O
of O
partial O
trisomy B-Disease
21 I-Disease
patients B-Species
and O
located O
between O
t(4;21) O
break O
point O
and O
ERG O
(approximately O
1.6 O
Mb). O
DSCR5 B-Gene
and O
DSCR6 B-Gene
genes O
consist O
of O
6 O
and O
5 O
exons, O
respectively. O
Alternative O
use O
of O
transcription O
start O
sites O
and O
alternative O
splicing O
events O
produce O
different O
RNA O
species O
and O
proteins O
from O
both O
genes. O
Three O
different O
transcripts O
of O
DSCR5 B-Gene
gene O
encode O
three O
putative O
transmembrane O
proteins O
of O
158, O
134, O
and O
108 O
amino O
acids, O
while O
4 O
different O
transcripts O
of O
DSCR6 B-Gene
gene O
encode O
two O
forms O
of O
proteins O
with O
190 O
and O
106 O
amino O
acids. O
The O
DSCR5 B-Gene
gene O
is O
expressed O
in O
various O
human B-Species
tissues O
examined, O
whereas O
the O
DSCR6 B-Gene
gene O
is O
expressed O
only O
in O
limited O
tissues O
at O
low O
level. O
Both O
DSCR5 B-Gene
and O
DSCR6 B-Gene
genes O
are O
candidates O
for O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
Down B-Disease
syndrome, I-Disease
although O
the O
function O
of O
these O
genes O
remains O
to O
be O
elucidated. O
