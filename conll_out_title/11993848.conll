# Abstract
Xanthine B-Chemical
oxidoreductase I-Gene
(XOR) B-Gene
can O
exist O
in O
a O
dehydrogenase O
form O
(XD) O
and O
an O
oxidase O
form O
(XO). O
The O
D-form O
uses O
NAD B-Chemical
as O
cofactor O
and O
the O
O-form O
uses O
oxygen B-Chemical
as O
second O
substrate O
and O
produces O
oxygen B-Chemical
radicals. I-Chemical
Both O
enzymes O
have O
a O
high O
affinity O
for O
hypoxanthine B-Chemical
and O
xanthine B-Chemical
as O
substrate O
and O
produce O
uric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
a O
potent O
antioxidant. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
XOR B-Gene
activity O
was O
demonstrated O
with O
the O
ferricyanide B-Chemical
method O
in O
permeabilized O
isolated O
rat B-Species
liver O
cells O
at O
the O
electron O
microscopical O
level. O
Moreover, O
ultrastructural O
localization O
of O
XO O
activity O
in O
these O
cells O
was O
studied O
with O
the O
cerium B-Chemical
salt I-Chemical
method. O
Activity O
of O
both O

Only O
XOR B-Gene
activity O
was O
present O
as O
well O
in O
the O

of O
rat B-Species

In O
Kupffer O
cells O
and O
sinusoidal O
endothelial O
cells, O
XOR B-Gene
activity O
was O
demonstrated O
in O
vesicles O
and O
occasionally O
on O
granular O
endoplasmic O
reticulum. O
XO O
activity O
