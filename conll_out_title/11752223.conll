# Abstract
The O

expressed O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
tissues, O
including O
kidney, O
lung, O
and O
the O
central O

system, O
mediates O
the O
uphill O
transport O
of O
di- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
tripeptides, I-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
a O
variety O
of O
peptidomimetic O
drugs. O
To O

the O
essential O
molecular O

that O
determine O
affinity O
and O
transport O
by O
PEPT2, B-Gene
we O
synthesized O
a O

as O

Whereas O

PEPT2, B-Gene
the O
introduction O

increased O
both O

us O

by O
elongating O
the O
omega O

when O
located O

position, O
whereas O
the O
elongation O
in O
the O
carboxyl O

caused O
less O

effects. O
The O
results O
clearly O
establish O
that O

the O
main O

This O

the O
framework O
