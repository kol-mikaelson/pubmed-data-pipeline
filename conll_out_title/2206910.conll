# Abstract
A O
model O
for O
the O
beta-amino B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
taurine B-Chemical
transport O
is O
presented O
to O

define O
the O

requirements O
for O
the O

of O
taurine B-Chemical
into O
the O

membrane O
vesicle O
(BBMV). O
Sodium-(Na+)-taurine O
symport O
across O

of O
the O

tubule O
has O
a O
highly O

Active O
taurine B-Chemical

complex. O
Complexes O
like O
the O
one O
required O
for O
maximal O
taurine B-Chemical
transport O
may O
be O
pertinent O
for O
many O
other O
amino O
acids O
whose O
uptake O
is O
Na(+)-dependent. O
Renal O
epithelial O
cell O
lines O
LLC-PK B-CellLine
and O
MDCK B-CellLine
were O
used O
to O
define O
the O
nature O
of O
taurine B-Chemical
uptake; O
they O
express O
Na(+)-Cl(-)-taurine O
cotransport O
that O
is O
inhibited O
by O
beta-alanine. B-Chemical
The O

or O
down-regulate O
taurine B-Chemical
transport O
in O
response O

changes O
in O
the O
taurine B-Chemical
concentration O
of O
the O

in O
a O
manner O
similar O
to O
that O
seen O
in O
BBMV. O
The O

is O
present O
by O
12 O

depends O
on O
new O

and O
protein O
import O
to O

The O
role O
of O
trafficking O
in O
the O
adaptive O
response O
was O
also O
explored O
in O
brush O
border O
vesicles. O
During O
dietary O
surfeit, O
transporter O
could O
be O
down-regulated O
and O
transporters O
could O
be O
shifted O
back O
into O
the O
microtubule O
system, O
resulting O
in O
taurinuria. B-Disease
Use O

a O
more O
mechanistic O
exploration O
of O
intracellular O

down-expression O
of O
the O
Na(+)-Cl(-)-taurine O

Colchicine B-Chemical
