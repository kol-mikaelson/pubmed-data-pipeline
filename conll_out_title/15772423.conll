# Abstract
The O
paraoxonase O
(PON) O
gene O
family O
in O
humans B-Species
has O
three O
members, O
PON1, B-Gene
PON2, B-Gene
and O
PON3. B-Gene
Their O
physiological O
role(s) O
and O
natural O
substrates O
are O
uncertain. O
We O
developed O
a O
baculovirus-mediated O
expression O
system, O
suitable O
for O
all O
three O
human B-Species
PONs, O
and O
optimized O
procedures O
for O
their O
purification. O
The O
recombinant O
PONs O
are O
glycosylated O
with O
high-mannose-type O
sugars, B-Chemical
which O
are O
important O
for O
protein O
stability O
but O
are O
not O
essential O
for O
their O
enzymatic O
activities. O
Enzymatic O
characterization O
of O
the O
purified O
PONs O
has O
revealed O
them O
to O
be O
lactonases O
lactonizing O
enzymes, O
with O
some O
overlapping O
substrates O
(e.g., O
aromatic B-Chemical
lactones), I-Chemical
but O
also O
to O
have O
distinctive O
substrate O
specificities. O
All O
three O
PONs O
metabolized O
very O
efficiently O
5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
1,5-lactone I-Chemical
and O
4-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
which O
are O
products O
of O
both O
enzymatic O
and O
nonenzymatic O
oxidation O
of O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
docosahexaenoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
respectively, O
and O
may O
represent O
the O
PONs' O
endogenous O
substrates. O
Organophosphates B-Chemical
are O
hydrolyzed O
almost O
exclusively O
by O
PON1, B-Gene
whereas O
bulky O
drug O
substrates O
such O
as O
lovastatin B-Chemical
and O
spironolactone B-Chemical
are O
hydrolyzed O
only O
by O
PON3. B-Gene
Of O
special O
interest O
is O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
human B-Species
PONs, O
especially O
PON2, B-Gene
to O
hydrolyze O
and O
thereby O
inactivate O
N-acyl-homoserine B-Chemical
lactones, I-Chemical
which O
are O
quorum-sensing O
signals O
of O
pathogenic O
bacteria. O
None O
of O
the O
recombinant O
PONs O
protected O
low O
density O
lipoprotein O
against O
copper-induced O
oxidation O
in O
vitro. O
