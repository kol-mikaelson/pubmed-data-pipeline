# Abstract
CPT1c B-Gene
is O
a O
carnitine B-Gene
palmitoyltransferase I-Gene
1 I-Gene
(CPT1) B-Gene
isoform O
that O
is O
expressed O
only O
in O
the O
brain. O
The O
enzyme O
has O
recently O
been O
localized O
in O
neuron O
mitochondria. O
Although O
it O
has O
high O
sequence O
identity O
with O
the O
other O
two O
CPT1 B-Gene
isoenzymes O
(a O
and O
b), O
no O
CPT O
activity O
has O
been O
detected O
to O
date. O
Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
CPT1c B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
neurons O
but O
not O
in O
astrocytes O
of O
mouse B-Species
brain O
sections. O
Overexpression O
of O
CPT1c B-Gene
fused O
to O
the O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
in O
cultured O
cells O
demonstrates O
that O
CPT1c B-Gene
is O
localized O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
rather O
than O
mitochondria O
and O
that O
the O
N-terminal O
region O
of O
CPT1c B-Gene
is O
responsible O
for O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
protein O
localization. O
Western O
blot O
experiments O
with O
cell O
fractions O
from O
adult O
mouse B-Species
brain O
corroborate O
these O
results. O
In O
addition, O
overexpression O
studies O
demonstrate O
that O
CPT1c B-Gene
does O
not O
participate O
in O
mitochondrial O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation, O
as O
would O
be O
expected O
from O
its O
subcellular O
localization. O
To O
identify O
the O
substrate O
of O
CPT1c B-Gene
enzyme, O
rat B-Species
cDNA O
was O
overexpressed O
in O
neuronal O
PC-12 B-CellLine
cells, O
and O
the O
levels O
of O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
were O
measured O
by O
high-performance O
liquid O
chromatography-mass O
spectrometry. O
Palmitoylcarnitine B-Chemical
was O
the O
only O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
to O
increase O
in O
transfected O
cells, O
which O
indicates O
that O
palmitoyl-CoA B-Chemical
is O
the O
enzyme O
substrate O
and O
that O
CPT1c B-Gene
has O
CPT1 B-Gene
activity. O
Microsomal O
fractions O
of O
PC-12 B-CellLine
and O
HEK293T B-CellLine
cells O
overexpressing O
CPT1c B-Gene
protein O
showed O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
CPT1 B-Gene
activity O
of O
0.57 O
and O
0.13 O
nmol.mg(-1).min(-1), O
respectively, O
which O
is O
approximately O
50% O
higher O
than O
endogenous O
CPT1 B-Gene
activity. O
Kinetic O
studies O
demonstrate O
that O
CPT1c B-Gene
has O
similar O
affinity O
to O
CPT1a O
for O
both O
substrates O
but O
20-300 O
times O
lower O
catalytic O
efficiency. O
