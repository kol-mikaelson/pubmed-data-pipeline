# Abstract
Transplacental O
transfer O
of O
taurine, B-Chemical
a O
beta-amino B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
essential O
for O
fetal O
and O
neonatal O
development, O
constitutes O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
taurine B-Chemical
for O
the O
fetus. O
Placental O
transport O
of O
taurine B-Chemical
is O
compromised O
in O
pregnancies O
complicated O
by O
intrauterine B-Disease
growth I-Disease
restriction, I-Disease
resulting O
in O
a O
reduced O
concentration O
of O
taurine B-Chemical
in O
cord O
plasma. O
This O
could O
impact O
on O
fetal O
cellular O
metabolism O
as O
taurine B-Chemical
represents O
the O
most O
abundant O
intracellular O
amino O
acid O
in O
many O
fetal O
cell O
types. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
have O
used O
pure O
isolates O
of O
fetal O
platelets O
and O
T O
lymphocytes O
from O
cord O
blood O
of O
placentas, O
from O
normal, O
term O
pregnancies, O
as O
fetal O
cell O
types O
to O
examine O
the O
cellular O
uptake O
mechanisms O
for O
taurine B-Chemical
by O
the O
system O
beta O
transporter O
and O
have O
compared O
gene O
and O
protein O
expression O
for O
the O
taurine B-Gene
transporter I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(TAUT) B-Gene
in O
these O
two O
cell O
types. O
System O
beta O
activity O
in O
fetal O
platelets O
was O
15-fold O
higher O
compared O
with O
fetal O
T O
lymphocytes O
(P O
< O
0.005), O
mirroring O
greater O
TAUT B-Gene
mRNA O
expression O
in O
platelets O
than O
T O
lymphocytes O
(P O
< O
0.005). O
Cell-specific O
differences O
in O
TAUT B-Gene
protein O
moieties O
were O
detected O
with O
a O
doublet O
of O
75 O
and O
80 O
kDa O
in O
fetal O
platelets O
compared O
with O
114 O
and O
120 O
kDa O
in O
fetal O
T O
lymphocytes, O
with O
relatively O
higher O
expression O
in O
platelets. O
We O
conclude O
that O
greater O
system O
beta O
activity O
in O
fetal O
platelets O
compared O
with O
T O
lymphocytes O
is O
the O
result O
of O
relatively O
greater O
TAUT B-Gene
mRNA O
and O
protein O
expression. O
This O
study O
represents O
the O
first O
characterization O
of O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
in O
fetal O
T O
lymphocytes. O
