# Abstract
Mechanisms O
leading O
to O
down-regulation O
of O
activated O
microglia O
and O
astrocytes O
are O
poorly O
understood, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
potentially O
detrimental O
role O
of O
activated O
glia O
in O
neurodegeneration. B-Disease
Prostaglandins, B-Chemical
produced O
both O
by O
neurons O
and O
glia, O
may O
serve O
as O
mediators O
of O
glial O
and O
neuronal O
functions. O
We O
examined O
the O
influence O
of O
cyclopentenone B-Chemical
prostaglandins I-Chemical
and O
their O
precursors O
on O
activated O
glia. O
As O
models O
of O
glial O
activation, O
production O
of O
inducible B-Gene
nitric-oxide I-Gene
synthase I-Gene
(iNOS) B-Gene
was O
studied O
in O
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated O
rat B-Species
microglia, O
a O
murine B-Species
microglial O
cell O
line O
BV-2, B-CellLine
and O
IL-1beta-stimulated O
rat B-Species
astrocytes. O
Cyclopentenone B-Chemical
prostaglandins I-Chemical
were O
potent O
inhibitors O
of O
iNOS B-Gene
induction O
and O
were O
more O
effective O
than O
their O
precursors, O
prostaglandins B-Chemical
E2 I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
D2. I-Chemical
15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin B-Chemical
J2 I-Chemical
(15d-PGJ2) B-Chemical
was O
the O
most O
potent O
prostaglandin B-Chemical
among O
those O
tested. O
In O
activated O
microglia, O
15d-PGJ2 B-Chemical
suppressed O
iNOS B-Gene
promoter O
activity, O
iNOS B-Gene
mRNA, O
and O
protein O
levels. O
The O
action O
of O
15d-PGJ2 B-Chemical
does O
not O
appear O
to O
involve O
its O
nuclear O
receptor O
peroxisome B-Gene
proliferator-activated I-Gene
receptor I-Gene
gamma I-Gene
(PPARgamma) B-Gene
because O
troglitazone, B-Chemical
a O
specific O
ligand O
of O
PPARgamma, B-Gene
was O
unable O
to O
inhibit O
iNOS B-Gene
induction, O
and O
neither O
troglitazone B-Chemical
nor O
15d-PGJ2 B-Chemical
could O
stimulate O
the O
activity O
of O
a O
PPAR-dependent O
promoter O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
cotransfected O
PPARgamma. B-Gene
15d-PGJ2 B-Chemical
did O
not O
block O
nuclear O
translocation O
or O
DNA-binding O
activity O
of O
the O
transcription O
factor O
NFkappaB, O
but O
it O
did O
inhibit O
the O
activity O
of O
an O
NFkappaB O
reporter O
construct, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
mechanism O
of O
suppression O
of O
microglial O
iNOS B-Gene
by O
15d-PGJ2 B-Chemical
may O
involve O
interference O
with O
NFkappaB O
transcriptional O
activity O
in O
the O
nucleus. O
Thus, O
our O
data O
suggest O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
novel O
pathway O
mediated O
by O
cyclopentenone B-Chemical
prostaglandins, I-Chemical
which O
may O
represent O
part O
of O
a O
feedback O
mechanism O
leading O
to O
the O
cessation O
of O
inflammatory B-Disease
glial O
responses O
in O
the O
brain. O
