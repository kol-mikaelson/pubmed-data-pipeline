# Abstract
Succinyl B-Gene
CoA: I-Gene
3-oxo I-Gene
acid I-Gene
CoA I-Gene
transferase I-Gene
(scot; B-Gene

is O
a O
key O
enzyme O
for O
metabolism O
of O

Previously, O
we O
have O
cloned O
a O
testis-specific B-Gene

In O
this O
study, O
the O
human B-Species
orthologue O
of O
mouse B-Species
scot-t B-Gene
was O
cloned O
and O
characterized. O
The O
entire O
coding O

of O
the O
mRNA O
and O
the O
deduced O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
of O
human B-Species
Scot-t B-Gene
(h-Scot-t) O
showed O
75.4 O
and O
75.8% O
identity O
with O
mouse B-Species
scot-t B-Gene
respectively. O
The O
mRNA O
was O
exclusively O
expressed O
in O
the O
testis, O
and O
the O
protein O
was O
localized O
to O
the O
midpiece O
of O
ejaculated O
spermatozoa O
where O
mitochondria O
exist. O
We O
showed O
that O
the O
h-Scot-t O
gene O
was O
intronless O
by O
using O
a O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
technique O
and O
that O
a O
non-functional O
pseudogene, O
98% O
similar O
to O
h-Scot-t, O
was O
also O
located O
on O
the O
human B-Species
genome O
(1p33-34.3). B-Chromosome
Furthermore, O
the O
genomic O
structure O
of O
the O
actual O
h-Scot-t O

unit O
was O
found O
to O
be O

(1p34.1-35.3) B-Chromosome
of O
the O

In O
conclusion, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
h-Scot-t O
is O
a O
single O
intronless O
gene O
specifically O
expressed O
in O
the O
testis. O
