# Abstract
Organic O
anion-transporting O
polypeptides O
(OATPs), O
members O
of O
the O
SLCO O
SLC21 O
family, O
mediate O
the O
transport O
of O
various O
endo- O
and O
xenobiotics. O
In O
human B-Species
liver, O
OATP1B1, B-Gene
1B3, I-Gene
and I-Gene
2B1 I-Gene
are O
located O
at O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
of O
hepatocytes O
and O
are O
involved O
in O
hepatic O
drug O
uptake O
and O
biliary O
elimination. O
Clinically O
significant O
drug-drug B-Disease
interactions O
(DDIs) O
mediated O
by O
hepatic O
OATPs O
have O
drawn O
great O
attention O
from O
clinical O
practitioners O
and O
researchers. O
However, O
there O
are O
considerable O
challenges O
to O
prospectively O
understanding O
the O
extent O
of O
OATP-mediated O
DDIs O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
specific O
OATP B-Gene
inhibitors O
or O
substrates O
and O
the O
limitations O
of O
in O
vitro O
tools. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
a O
novel O
RNA O
interference O
knockdown O
sandwich-cultured O
human B-Species
hepatocyte O
model O
was O
developed O
and O
validated. O
Quantitative O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction, O
microarray O
and O
immunoblotting O
analyses, O
along O
with O
uptake O
assays, O
illustrated O
that O
the O
expression O
and O
transport O
activity O
of O
hepatic O
OATPs O
were O
reduced O
by O
small O
interfering O
(siRNA) O
efficiently O
and O
specifically O
in O
this O
model. O
Although O
OATP B-Gene
siRNA O
decreased O
only O
20 O
to O
30% O
of O
the O
total O
uptake O
of O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
into O
human B-Species
hepatocytes, O
it O
caused O
a O
50% O
reduction O
in O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
metabolism, O
which O
was O
observed O
by O
monitoring O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
two O
major O
metabolites O
of O
cerivastatin. B-Chemical
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
coadministration O
of O
a O
drug O
that O
is O
a O
hepatic O
OATP B-Gene
inhibitor O
could O
significantly O
alter O
the O
pharmacokinetic O
profile O
of O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
in O
clinical O
studies. O
Further O
studies O
with O
this O
novel O
model O
demonstrated O
that O
OATP B-Gene
and O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
have O
a O
synergistic O
effect O
on O
cerivastatin-gemfibrozil O
interactions. O
The O
siRNA O
knockdown O
sandwich-cultured O
human B-Species
hepatocytes O
may O
provide O
a O
new O
powerful O
model O
for O
evaluating O
DDIs. O
