# Abstract
Proton-coupled O
peptide O
transporters, O
localized O
at O
brush-border O
membranes O
of O
intestinal O
and O
renal O
epithelial O
cells, O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
protein O
absorption O
and O
the O
conservation O
of O
peptide-bound O
amino O
nitrogen. O
These O
transporters O
also O
have O
significant O
pharmacological O
and O
pharmacokinetic O
relevance O
to O
the O
transport O
of O
various O
peptide-like O
drugs O
such O
as O
beta-lactam B-Chemical
antibiotics. O
The O
identification O
and O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
H(+) O
peptide O
cotransporters O
(PEPT1 B-Gene
and O
PEPT2) B-Gene
have O
facilitated O
the O
clarification O
of O
many O
aspects O
of O
these O
transporters O
such O
as O
the O
structure O
function O
relationship O
and O
regulation. O
Recent O
findings O
that O
intestinal O
PEPT1 B-Gene
can O
transport O
l-valine B-Chemical
ester I-Chemical
prodrugs O
such O
as O
valacyclovir B-Chemical
provided O
a O
major O
step O
forward O
toward O
the O
development O
of O
novel O
drug O
delivery O
systems. O
It O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
peptide O
transporters, O
which O
have O
a O
similar O
substrate O
specificity O
to O
PEPT1 B-Gene
and O
PEPT2, B-Gene
but O
possess O
other O
distinct O
functional O
properties, O
are O
localized O
at O
basolateral O
membranes O
of O
intestinal O
and O
renal O
epithelial O
cells. O
This O
review O
highlights O
the O
recent O
advances O
in O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
cellular O
and O
molecular O
nature O
of O
PEPT1, B-Gene
PEPT2 B-Gene
and O
the O
basolateral O
peptide O
transporters. O
