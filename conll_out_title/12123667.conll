# Abstract
Malonyl-CoA B-Gene
decarboxylase I-Gene
is O
the O
main O
route O
for O
the O
disposal O
of O
malonyl-CoA, B-Chemical
the O
key O
metabolite O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
mitochondrial O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation. O
We O
have O
developed O
a O
simple O
and O
sensitive O
radiochemical O
assay O
to O
determine O
malonyl-CoA B-Gene
decarboxylase I-Gene
activity. O
The O
decarboxylation O
of O
[2-14C]malonyl-CoA B-Chemical
produces O
[2-14C]acetyl-CoA, B-Chemical
which O
is O
converted O
to O
[2-14C]acetylcarnitine B-Chemical
in O
the O
presence O
of O
excess O
L-carnitine B-Chemical
and O
carnitine B-Gene
acetyltransferase. I-Gene
The O
positively O
charged O
radiolabeled O
product, O
acetylcarnitine, B-Chemical
is O
separated O
from O
negatively O
charged O
excess O
radiolabeled O
substrate O
and O
the O
radioactivity O
measured O
by O
scintillation O
counting. O
Measurement O
of O
malonyl-CoA B-Gene
decarboxylase I-Gene
activities O
with O
this O
method O
gives O
values O
comparable O
to O
those O
obtained O
with O
assays O
currently O
in O
use, O
but O
has O
the O
advantage O
of O
being O
simpler O
and O
less O
labor O
intensive. O
We O
have O
applied O
this O
assay O
to O
rat B-Species
skeletal O
muscle O
of O
different O
fiber-type O
composition O
and O
to O
rat B-Species
heart. O
Malonyl-CoA B-Gene
decarboxylase I-Gene
activity O
(mU O

correlates O
with O
the O
oxidative O

of O
the O
muscles, O
being O

(42.7 O

and O

Studies O

of O
malonyl-CoA B-Gene
decarboxylase I-Gene
activity O
in O
rat B-Species
heart O

rat B-Species
skeletal O

show O
that O
approximately O
50 O
and O
65% O
is O
localized O
to O
mitochondria, O
while O
50 O
and O
35% O
of O
the O
activity O
is O
extramitochondrial. O
