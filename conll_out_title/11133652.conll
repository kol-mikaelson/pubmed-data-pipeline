# Abstract
Amino O
acids O
are O
essential O
components O
of O
media O
utilized O
to O
culture O
fertilized O
human B-Species
eggs O
to O
the O
blastocyst O
stage O
in O
vitro. O
Use O
of O
such O
media O
has O
led O
to O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
proportion O
of O
embryos O
that O
implant O
upon O
transfer O
to O
the O
uterus O
and O
to O
a O
decrease O
in O
the O
number O
that O
need O
to O
be O
transferred O
to O
achieve O
pregnancy. O
Little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
amino O
acids O
foster O
development O
of O
healthy O
human B-Species
blastocysts. O
Indications O
are, O
however, O
that O
many O
of O
these O
mechanisms O
are O
the O
same O
in O
human B-Species
and O
mouse O
embryos. O
Both O
essential O
and O
nonessential O
amino O
acid O
transport O
benefit O
preimplantation O
mouse O
embryo O
development, O
albeit O
at O
different O
stages. O
Nonessential O
amino O
acid O
transport O
improves O
development O
primarily O
during O
cleavage, O
whereas O
essential O
amino O
acid O
transport O
supports O
development O
of O
more O
viable O
embryos, O
especially O
subsequent O
to O
the O
eight-cell O
stage. O
This O
review O
discusses O
likely O
mechanisms O
for O
these O
beneficial O
effects. O
