# Abstract
Exposure O
of O
the O
skin O
to O
sunlight O
results O
in O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
content O
of O
epidermal O
urocanic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
a O
key O
metabolite O
of O
L-histidine, B-Chemical
and O
some O
portions O
of O
the O
metabolite O
penetrate O
into O
the O
body O
fluid. O
S-[2-Carboxy-1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]glutathione B-Chemical
(GS(CIE)), O
an O
adduct O
of O
glutathione B-Chemical
and O
urocanic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
was O
proposed O
to O
be O
an O
origin O
of O
a O
urinary O
compound, O
S-[2-carboxy-1-(1 B-Chemical
H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]-L-cysteine I-Chemical
(Cys(CIE)). O
Various O
catabolites O
of O
Cys(CIE) O
were O
also O
isolated O
from O
human B-Species
urine O
previously. O
However, O
no O
direct O
evidence O
to O
show O
the O
existence O
of O
GS(CIE) O
as O
a O
biological O
material O
had O
been O
found. O
By O
using O
capillary O
electrophoresis, O
the O
glutathione B-Chemical
adduct O
has O
now O
been O
found O
in O
the O
extracts O
of O
rat B-Species
tissues O
from O
the O
kidney, O
liver, O
skin O
and O
blood O
when O
the O
rat B-Species
was O
kept O
under O
conditions O
of O
sunlight O
irradiation O
after O
the O
fur O
on O
the O
dorsal O
skin O
had O
been O
clipped. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
no O
or O
a O
trace O
of O
GS(CIE) O
was O
determined O
in O
rat B-Species
tissue O
extracts O
when O
the O
animal O
was O
kept O
indoor O
in O
usual O
manner. O
The O
glutathione B-Chemical
adduct O
was O
isolated O
from O
the O
kidney O
extract O
of O
the O
sunlight-irradiated O
rat B-Species
using O
ion-exchangers O
and O
high-voltage O
paper O
electrophoresis, O
and O
determined O
by O
fast-atom-bombardment O
mass O
spectrometry. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
GS(CIE) O
formation O
actually O
occurs O
in O
the O
body O
and O
that O
the O
formation O
is O
accelerated O
by O
exposing O
the O
rat B-Species
to O
sunlight O
irradiation. O
From O
these O
findings, O
we O
propose O
an O
alternative O
pathway O
of O
histidine B-Chemical
metabolism O
which O
is O
initiated O
by O
the O
adduction O
of O
urocanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
glutathione B-Chemical
to O
form O
GS(CIE) O
and O
terminates O
with O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
urinary O
compounds O
via O
Cys(CIE). O
