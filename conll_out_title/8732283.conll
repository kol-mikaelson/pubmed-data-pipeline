# Abstract
1. O
The O
macrolide B-Chemical
tacrolimus B-Chemical
(FK506), B-Chemical
used O
as O
an O
immunosuppressant, O
is O
a O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) I-Gene
3A I-Gene
substrate O
in O
the O
liver. O
The O
metabolism O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
and O
the O
transport O
of O
its O
metabolites O
in O
the O
pig B-Species
gut O
was O
studied O
in O
the O
Ussing O
chamber. O
Tacrolimus B-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolites O
were O
quantified O
by O
h.p.l.c. O
mass O
spectrometry. O
2. O
In O
the O
Ussing O
chamber, O
demethyl, O
didemethyl, B-Chemical
hydroxy O
and O
hydroxy-demethyl O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
were O
generated. O
Their O
formation O
was O
concentration- O
and O
time-dependent. O
The O
metabolite O
pattern O
was O
not O
different O
from O
that O
after O
incubation O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
with O
human B-Species
small O
intestinal O
microsomes. O
3. O
The O
metabolite O
formation O
was O
highest O
in O
the O
duodenum O
and O
declined O
in O
the O
order O
duodenum O
> O
jejunum O
> O
ileum O
> O
colon O
> O
stomach. O
4. O
Since O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
metabolism O
was O
inhibited O
by O
the O
specific O
CYP3A B-Gene
inhibitors, O
troleandomycin B-Chemical
and O
ketoconazole, B-Chemical
we O
concluded O
that O
these O
enzymes O
are O
involved O
in O
intestinal O
metabolism O
of O
tacrolimus. B-Chemical
5. O
Tacrolimus B-Chemical
metabolites O
re-entered O
the O
mucosa O
chamber O
(> O
90%) O
and O
passed O
through O
the O
small O
intestinal O
preparation O
into O
the O
serosa O
chamber. O
6. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
is O
metabolized O
in O
the O
intestine, O
that O
the O
metabolites O
are O
able O
to O
re-enter O
the O
gut O
lumen O
and O
also O
enter O
into O
the O
portal O
vein O
and O
that O
small O
intestinal O
metabolism O
and O
transport O
is O
at O
least O
in O
part O
responsible O
for O
the O
low O
oral O
bioavailability O
of O
tacrolimus. B-Chemical
