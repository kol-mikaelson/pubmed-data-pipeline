# Abstract
This O
review O
describes O
the O
current O
state O
of O
knowledge O
about O
the O
ABCD O
family O
of O
peroxisomal O
half O
adenosine-triphosphate-binding O
cassette O
(ABC) O
transporters. O
ABCDs O
are O
predicted O
to O
be O
present O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
eukaryotic O
organisms, O
although O
at O
present, O
only O
ABCDs O
in O
the O
yeast B-Species
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae, I-Species
the O
plant O
Arabidopsis B-Species
thaliana, I-Species
and O
different O
mammalian O
species O
have O
been O
identified O
and O
characterized O
to O
any O
significant O
extent. O
The O
functional O
role O
of O
none O
of O
these O
ABCDs O
has O
been O
established O
definitively O
and O
awaits O
successful O
reconstitution O
of O
ABCDs, O
either O
as O
homo- O
or O
heterodimers O
into O
liposomes, O
followed O
by O
transport O
studies. O
Data O
obtained O
in O
S. B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
suggest O
that O
the O
two O
ABCDs, O
which O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
this O
organism, O
form O
a O
heterodimer, O
which O
actually O
transports O
acyl B-Chemical
coenzyme B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
across O
the O
peroxisomal O
membrane. O
In O
mammals, O
four O
ABCDs O
have O
been O
identified, O
of O
which O
one O
[adrenoleukodystrophy O
protein O
(ALDP)] B-Gene
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
the O
transport O
of O
the O
coenzyme B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
of O
very-long-chain O
fatty B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
Mutations O
in O
the O
gene O
(ABCD1) B-Gene
encoding O
ALDP B-Gene
are O
the O
cause O
of O
a O
severe O
X-linked B-Disease
disease, I-Disease
called O
X-linked B-Disease
adrenoleukodystrophy. I-Disease
The O
availability O
of O
mutant O
mice B-Species
in O
which O
Abcd1, B-Gene
Abcd2, B-Gene
or O
Abcd3 B-Gene
have O
been O
disrupted O
will O
help O
to O
resolve O
the O
true O
role O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
half-ABC O
transporters. O
