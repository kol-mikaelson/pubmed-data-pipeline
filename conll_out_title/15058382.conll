# Abstract
Three O
closely O
related O
genes O
encoding O
amino O
acid O
transport O
proteins O
are O
clustered O
on O
5q32 B-Chromosome
in O
humans, B-Species
and O
Chromosome O
(Chr) O
11 O
in O
mice. B-Species
The O
human B-Species
SLC36A1 B-Gene
gene, O
which O
encodes O
the O
lysosomal O
amino O
acid O
transporter O
LYAAT1 B-Gene
PAT1, B-Gene
generates O
multiple O
alternative O
mRNAs, O
some O
of O
which O
encode O
truncated O
proteins. O
SLC36A1 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
numerous O
tissues, O
whereas O
expression O
of O
SLC36A2, B-Gene
which O
encodes O
the O
glycine O
transporter O
tramdorinl O
PAT2, B-Gene
is O
most O
abundant O
in O
kidney O
and O
muscle. O
Expression O
of O
a O
third O
gene, O
SLC36A3, B-Gene
is O
restricted O
to O
testis. O
Mouse B-Species
Slc36a2 B-Gene
also O
is O
expressed O
in O
bone O
and O
fat O
tissue. O
Polymorphisms O
in O
human B-Species
SLC36A2 B-Gene
exclude O
it O
as O
a O
candidate O
locus O
for O
a O
peripheral B-Disease
neuropathy I-Disease
that O
has O
been O
mapped O
to O
5q31-33. B-Chromosome
SLC36A2 B-Gene
is O
a O
candidate O
gene O
for O
5q-myelodysplastic O
syndrome, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
its O
chromosomal O
location O
and O
its O
expression O
in O
bone. O
