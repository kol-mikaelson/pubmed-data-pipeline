# Abstract
Long-chain B-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(LCFAs) B-Chemical
are O
not O
only O
important O
metabolites O
but O
contribute O
to O
many O
cellular O
functions O
including O
activation O
of O
protein B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
C I-Gene
(PKC) B-Gene
isoforms O
and O
nuclear O
transcription O
factors O
such O
as O
peroxisome O
proliferator-activated O
receptors O
(PPAPs). O
To O
assert O
their O
diverse O
effects O
LCFAs B-Chemical
have O
first O
to O
traverse O
the O
plasma O
membrane, O
a O
process O
that O
can O
occur O
either O
through O
diffusion O
or O
be O
mediated O
by O
proteins. O
Considerable O
evidence O
has O
accumulated O
to O
show O
that O
in O
addition O
to O
a O
diffusional O
component, O
the O
intestine, O
heart, O
adipose O
tissue, O
and O
the O
liver O
express O
a O
saturable O
and O
specific O
LCFA B-Chemical
transport O
system. O
Identifying O
the O
postulated O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporters O
is O
of O
considerable O
importance, O
since O
both O
increased O
and O
decreased O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
have O
been O
implicated O
in O
diseases O
such O
as O
type-2 B-Disease
diabetes I-Disease
and O
acute B-Disease

Fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transport O
proteins O
(FATPs O
solute O
carrier O
family O
27) O
are O
integral O
transmembrane O
proteins O
that O
enhance O
the O
uptake O
of O
long-chain O
and O
very O
long O
chain O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
into O
cells. O
In O
humans B-Species
FATPs O
comprise O
a O
family O
of O
six O
highly O
homologous O
proteins, O
hsFATP1-6, O
which O
are O
found O
in O
all O
fatty O
acid-utilizing O

of O
the O
body. O
This O
review O
will O
focus O
on O
a O
brief O
discussion O
of O
FATP O
expression O
patterns, O
regulation, O
structure, O
and O
mechanism O
of O
transport. O
