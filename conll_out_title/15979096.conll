a O
critical O
review. O

# Abstract
Anandamide B-Chemical
(AEA) B-Chemical
uptake O
has O
been O
described O
over O
the O
last O
decade O
to O
occur O
by O
facilitated O
diffusion, O
but O
a O
protein O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
isolated. O
In O
some O
cell O
types, O
it O
has O
recently O
been O
suggested O
that O
AEA, B-Chemical
an O
uncharged O
hydrophobic O
molecule, O
passively O
diffuses O
through O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
in O
a O
process O
that O
is O
not O
protein-mediated. O
Since O
that O
observation, O
recent O
kinetics O
studies O
(using O
varying O
assay O
conditions) O
have O
both O
supported O
and O
denied O
the O
presence O
of O
an O
AEA B-Chemical
transporter. O
In O
this O
review, O
we O
analyze O
the O
current O
literature O
exploring O
the O
mechanism O
of O
AEA B-Chemical
uptake O
and O
endeavor O
to O
explain O
the O
reasons O
for O
the O
divergent O
views. O
One O
of O
the O
main O
variables O
among O
laboratories O
is O
the O
incubation O
time O
of O
the O
cells O
with O
AEA. B-Chemical
Initial O
kinetics O
(at O
time O
points O
<1 O
min O
depending O
upon O
the O
cell O
type) O
isolate O
events O
that O
occur O
at O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
and O
are O
most O
useful O
to O
study O
saturability O
of O
uptake O
and O
effects O
of O
purported O
transport O
inhibitors O
upon O
uptake. O
Results O
with O
longer O
incubation O
times O
reflect O
events O
not O
only O
at O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
but O
also O
interactions O
at O
intracellular O
sites O
that O
may O
include O
enzyme(s), O
other O
proteins, O
or O
specialized O
lipid-binding O
domains. O
Furthermore, O
at O
long O
incubation O
times, O
antagonists O
to O
AEA B-Chemical
receptors O
reduce O
AEA B-Chemical
uptake. O
Another O
complicating O
factor O
in O
AEA B-Chemical
transport O
studies O
is O
the O
nonspecific O
binding O
to O
plastic O
culture O
dishes. O
The O
magnitude O
of O
this O
effect O
may O
exceed O
AEA B-Chemical
uptake O
into O
cells. O
Likewise, O
AEA B-Chemical
may O
be O
released O
from O
plastic O
culture O
dishes O
(without O
cells) O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
as O
to O
mimic O
efflux O
from O
cells. O
AEA B-Chemical
transport O
protocols O
using O
BSA, O
similar O
to O
the O
method O
used O
for O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
studies, O
are O
gaining O
acceptance. O
This O
may O
improve O
AEA B-Chemical
solution O
stability O
and O
minimize O
binding O
to O
plastic, O
although O
some O
groups O
report O
that O
BSA O
interferes O
with O
uptake. O
In O
response O
to O
criticisms O
that O
many O
transport O
inhibitors O
also O
inhibit O
the O
fatty B-Gene
acid I-Gene
amide I-Gene
hydrolase I-Gene
(FAAH), B-Gene
new O
compounds O
have O
recently O
been O
synthesized. O
Following O
their O
characterization O
in O
FAAH+ B-Gene
+ O
and O
FAAH- B-Gene
- O
cells O
and O
transgenic O
mice, B-Species
several O
inhibitors O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
physiological O
activity O
in O
FAAH- B-Gene
- O
mice. B-Species
Their O
targets O
are O
now O
being O
characterized O
with O
the O
possibility O
that O
a O
protein O
transporter O
for O
AEA B-Chemical
may O
be O
characterized. O
