# Abstract
PURPOSE: O
With O
the O
growing O
clinical O
usage O
of O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl B-Gene
coenzyme I-Gene
A I-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors O
(statins), O
the O
number O
of O
reports O
concerning O
serious O
drug-drug O
interaction O
has O
been O
increasing. O
Because O
recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
conversion O
between O
acid O
and O
lactone B-Chemical
forms O
occurs O
in O
the O
body, O
drug-drug O
interaction O
should O
be O
considered O
on O
both O
acid O
and O
lactone B-Chemical
forms. O
Thus, O
we O
investigated O
the O
inhibitory O
effects O
of O
acid O
and O
lactone B-Chemical
forms O
of O
eight O
statins, O
including O
one O
recently O
withdrawn, O
cerivastatin, B-Chemical
and O
two O
recently O
developed, O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
and O
rosuvastatin, B-Chemical

METHODS: O
The O
inhibitory O
effects O
of O
statins O
on O
CYP O
metabolic O
activities O
and O
MDR1 B-Gene
transporting O
activity O
were O
investigated O
using O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
and O
MDR1-overexpressing O
LLC-GA5-COL150 B-CellLine
cells, O
respectively. O
RESULTS: O
The O
acid O
forms O
had O
minimal O
inhibitory O
effects O
on O
all O
CYP O
activities O
tested, O
except O
for O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
on O
CYP2C9-mediated O
tolbutamide B-Chemical

(IC50 O

and O
simvastatin B-Chemical
on O
CYP3A4 O
5-mediated O
paclitaxel B-Chemical
3-hydroxylation O
(12.0 O
microM). O
Lactone B-Chemical
forms O
showed O
no O
or O
minimal O
inhibitory O
effects O
on O
CYP2C8, B-Gene
CYP2C9, B-Gene
and O
CYP2C19 B-Gene
activities, O
except O
for O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
on O
the O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
activity O
(20.5 O
microM), O
whereas O
they O
showed O
stronger O
inhibitory O
effects O
on O
the O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
5 I-Gene
activity O
with O
the O
rank O
order O
of O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
(5.6 O
microM), O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
(8.1 O
microM), O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
(14.9 O
microM), O
simvastatin B-Chemical
(15.2 O
microM), O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
(20.7 O
microM), O
and O
lovastatin B-Chemical
(24.1 O
microM). O
Pitavastatin B-Chemical
and O
pravastatin B-Chemical
had O
little O
inhibitory O
effect, O
and O
a O
similar O
order O
was O
found O
also O
for O
testosterone B-Chemical
6beta-hydroxylation. O
MDR1-mediated O
transport O
of O
[3H]digoxin B-Chemical
was O
inhibited O
only O
by O
lactone B-Chemical
forms, O
and O
the O
rank O
order O
correlated O
with O
that O
of O
inhibitory O
effects O
on O
both O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
5 I-Gene
activities. O
Inhibitory O
effects O
on O
MDR1 B-Gene
activity, O
and O
on O
both O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
5 I-Gene
activities, O
could O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
lipophilicity; O
however, O
a O
significant O
correlation O
was O
found O
between O
the O
lipophilicity O
and O
inhibitory O
effects O
on O
CYP2C8-mediated O
paclitaxel B-Chemical
6alpha-hydroxylation. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
We O
showed O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
acid O
and O
lactone B-Chemical
forms O
in O
terms O
of O
drug O
interaction. O
The O
lipophilicity O
could O
be O
one O
of O
the O
important O
factors O
for O
inhibitory O
effects. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
statins, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
examine O
the O
effects O
of O
both O
forms O
to O
understand O
the O
events O
found O
in O
clinical O
settings, O
including O
the O
pleiotropic O
effects. O
