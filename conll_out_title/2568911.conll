# Abstract
Ten O
metabolites O
of O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
were O
isolate O
from O
the O
ethyl B-Chemical
ether I-Chemical
extract O
of O
bile O
from O
four O
liver O
transplant O
patients B-Species
receiving O
cyclosporine. B-Chemical
Two O
of O
the O
metabolites O
were O
unique O
and O
previously O
unidentified. O
Liquid-liquid O
partitioning O
into O
diethyl B-Chemical
ether I-Chemical
with O
subsequent O
defatting O
with O
n-hexane B-Chemical
was O
used O
for O
the O
initial O
extraction O
from O
bile. O
Separation O
of O
the O
individual O
metabolites O
(A-J) O
was O
performed O
using O
a O
Sephadex B-Chemical
LH-20 I-Chemical
column O
and O
a O
gradient O
high O
performance O
liquid O
chromatographic O
method. O
The O
molecular O
weights O
of O
the O
isolated O
metabolites O
were O
determined O
by O
fast O
atom O
bombardment O
mass O
spectrometry. O
Gas O

analysis O
was O
also O
used O
to O
identify O
the O
amino O
acid O
composition O
and O
the O
hydroxylation O
position O
of O
metabolites O
A, O
B, O
C, O
D, O
and O
G. O
Proton O

were O
utilized O
to O
distinguish O
the O
chemical O
shifts O
of O
N-CH3 O
singlets O
and O
NH O
doublets O
of O
metabolites O
A, O
B, O
C, O
and O
D. O
Metabolites O
A, O
E, O
F, O
H, O
I, O
and O
J O
were O
reported O
previously O
in O
human B-Species
urine O
and O
animal O
bile. O
Metabolites O
C O
and O
D O
are O
dihydroxylated O
compounds O
which O
cannot O
be O
clearly O
described O
as O
previously O
isolated O
compounds. O
Metabolites O
B O
and O
G O
are O
novel O
metabolites O
with O
a O
mass O

which O
corresponded O
to O
a O

suggesting O
that O
the O
double O
bond O

has O
been O
modified. O
Metabolites O
B O
and O
G O
were O
primarily O
isolated O
from O
the O
bile O
of O
one O
of O
the O
liver O
transplant O
patients B-Species
which O
contained O
abnormally O
high O
concentrations O
of O
these O
two O
metabolites. O
The O
method O
described O
is O
an O
efficient O
procedure O
for O
isolating O
milligram O

of O
the O
major O
metabolites O
with O
greater O
than O
95% O
purity. O
