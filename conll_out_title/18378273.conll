# Abstract
Three O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
antagonists--losartan, O
candesartan, B-Chemical
and O
zolarsartan--were O
investigated. O
All O
the O
compounds, O
which O
are O
structural O
analogues, O
are O
metabolized O
via O
conjugation O
to O
glucuronic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Interestingly, O
both O
O- O
and O
N-glucuronidation O
take O
place, O
so O
that O
regioisomers O
are O
formed. O
One O
ether B-Chemical
O-glucuronide, I-Chemical
two O
acyl B-Chemical
O-glucuronides, I-Chemical
and O
five O
tetrazole-N-glucuronides B-Chemical
were O
biosynthesized, O
in O
milligram O
scale, O
from O
the O
three O
sartan O
aglycones. O
Liver O
microsomes O
from O
bovine, B-Species
moose, B-Species
rat, B-Species
and O
pig B-Species
and O
recombinant O
human B-Species
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases B-Gene
were O
used O
as O
catalysts. O
The O
synthesized O
compounds O
were O
identified O
as O
sartan O
glucuronides O
by O
mass O
spectrometry, O
while O
the O
sites O
of O
glucuronidation O
were O
determined O
by O
nuclear O
magnetic O
resonance O
spectroscopy. O
Drug O
metabolites O
are O
needed O
as O
standards O
for O
pharmaceutical O
research O
and, O
as O
the O
present O
study O
shows, O
they O
can O
easily O
be O
produced O
with O
enzymes O
as O
catalyst. O
