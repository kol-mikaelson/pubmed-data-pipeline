# Abstract
Genetic B-Disease
defects I-Disease
affecting O
acyl-CoA O
dehydrogenases O
(ACAD)-key O
enzymes O
in O
the O
degradation O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
branched O
chain O
amino O
acids-are O
increasingly O
recognized O
as O
being O
more O
widespread O
than O
originally O
thought. O
For O
the O
medium-chain B-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(MCAD), B-Gene
the O
K304E B-ProteinMutation
mutation O
is O
the O
most O
common O
genetic B-Disease
defect I-Disease
among O
Caucasian O
populations. O

(i3VD) O
and O
their O
genetic B-Disease
mutants O
(K304E- B-ProteinMutation
and O
T168A-MCAD O
and O
A282V-i3VD) O
is O
examined. O
Binding O
to O
the O
mutant O
ACADs O
is O
generally O
approximately O
10-fold O
weaker O
compared O
to O
wild-type O
proteins. O
Thermal O
stability O
of O
wt-MCAD O
(melting O

approximately O
53.6 O
degrees O
C) O
is O
significantly O
higher O
compared O
to O
wt-i3VD O
( O
approximately O
49.3 O
degrees O
C). O
With O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
A282V-i3VD O
mutant, O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
stabilization O
(5-11 O

is O
induced O
by O
conversion O

the O

The O
results O
are O
discussed O
based O
on O
the O
3D-structures O
of O
the O
enzymes, O
and O
it O
is O
concluded O
that O
in O
the O
case O
of O
K304E-MCAD O
thermal O
stability O
as O
such O
is O
not O
a O
major O
contribution O
to O
the O
clinical O
phenotype. O
With O
the O
T168A-MCAD O
and O
A282V-i3VD O
mutants, O
however, O
the O
diminished O
thermal O
stability O
and O
minor O
stabilization O
by O
ligands O
must O
be O
regarded O
as O
an O
important O
factor O
contributing O
to O
the O
manifestation O
of O
the O
disease. O
