# Abstract
Sterol B-Gene
12alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
(CYP8B1) B-Gene
is O
a O
hepatic O
cytochrome B-Gene
P-450 I-Gene
that O
controls O
the O
ratio O
of O
cholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
over O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
in O
bile O
and O
thus O
controls O
the O
solubility O
of O
cholesterol. B-Chemical
Both O
the O
human B-Species
and O
the O
mouse B-Species
CYP8B1 B-Gene
complementary O
DNA O
and O
gene O
were O
cloned O
and O
structurally O
characterized. O
Surprisingly, O
the O
genomic O
DNA O
from O
both O
species O
was O
found O
to O
lack O
introns. O
The O
major O
transcript O
of O
the O
human B-Species
gene O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
3950 O
bp, O
and O
the O
putative O
promoter O
region O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
at O
least O
1360 O
bp. O
The O
murine B-Species
structural O
gene O
was O
found O
to O
span O
approximately O
3 O
kb. O
By O
using O
FISH O
and O
radiation O
hybrid O
mapping O
techniques, O
the O
human B-Species
CYP8B1 B-Gene
gene O
was O
located O
to O
chromosome O
3p21.3-p22, O
whereas O
FISH O
mapped O
the O
murine B-Species
counterpart O
to O
chromosome O
9qF4, O
a O
region O
that O
is O
homologous O
to O
the O
third O
human B-Species
chromosome. O
The O
results O
from O
the O
chromosome O
mapping O
and O
Southern O
blotting O
indicated O
that O
the O
gene O
is O
present O
in O
a O
single O
copy. O
Transcription O
of O
the O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
CYP8B1 B-Gene
genes O
was O
initiated O
from O
a O
position O
situated O
51 O
and O
35 O
bases, O
respectively, O
downstream O
of O
a O
consensus O
TATA O
box. O
A O
homology O
of O
21% O
for O
the O
promoter O
regions O
of O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
may O
indicate O
differences O
in O
transcriptional O
regulation. O
Although O
a O
potent O
induction O
of O
CYP8B1 B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
observed O
upon O
starvation O
of O
mice, B-Species
the O
mechanism O
behind O
this O
effect O
was O
not O
revealed O
by O
analysis O
of O
the O
promoter O
for O
potential O
cis-acting O
elements. O
In O
the O
human B-Species
promoter, O
several O
possible O
cis-acting O
regions O
were O
identified O
but O
none O
of O
them O
could O
be O
directly O
related O
to O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism. O
After O
transfection O
of O
COS B-CellLine
cells O
with O
the O
human B-Species
coding O
region, O
mRNA O
and O
enzymatic O
activity O
for O
the O
12alpha-hydroxylase O
were O
identified. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
mammalian O
cytochrome B-Gene
P-450 I-Gene
gene O
reported O
to O
lack O
introns. O
The O
importance O
of O
this O
structural O
feature O
for O
evolution O
and O
gene O
regulation O
is O
discussed. O
