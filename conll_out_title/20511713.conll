# Abstract
The O
human B-Species
Acyl-CoA B-Gene
binding I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(ACBP) B-Gene
is O
a O
structural O
and O
functional O
highly O
conserved O
protein. O
As O
an O

ACBP B-Gene
influences O
overall O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism. O
Its O

To O

Integration O
of O
these O

suggested O
decreased O
lipid B-Chemical

Accordingly, O
saturated O
(16:0) O

monosaturated O

fatty O

were O
significantly O
reduced O

Taken O
together, O
we O
obtained O

that O
ACBP B-Gene
functions O
in O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism O
at O
the O
level O
of O
gene O
expression. O
This O
effect O
seems O
to O
be O
translated O
into O
certain O
metabolites. O
The O
