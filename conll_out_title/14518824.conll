# Abstract
Mitochondrial B-Disease
acetoacetyl-CoA I-Disease
thiolase I-Disease
(T2) B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
an O
inborn B-Disease
error I-Disease
of I-Disease
metabolism I-Disease
affecting O
isoleucine B-Chemical
and O
ketone B-Chemical
bodies O
in O
the O
catabolic O
process. O
Mutation O
analysis O
and O
expression O
analysis O
of O
mutant O
cDNAs O
have O
facilitated O
the O
division O
of O
T2-deficient B-Disease
patients B-Species
into O
two O
groups: O
those O
with O
null O
mutations O
in O
either O
allele O
(group O
1) O
and O
those O
with O
mutation(s) O
retaining O
some O
residual O
T2 O
activity O
in O
at O
least O
one O
of O
two O
mutant O
alleles O
(group O
II). O
Among O
5 O
Japanese O
T2-deficient B-Disease
patients, B-Species
GK01 O
belonged O
to O
group O
I O
and O
the O
other O
patients B-Species
(GK19, O
GK19B, O
GK30 O
and O
GK31) O
to O
group O
II. O
As O
we O
have O
suggested O
previously, O
the O
severity O
of O
ketoacidotic B-Disease
episodes O
in O
the O
group O
II O
patients B-Species
was O
similar O
to O
that O
in O
the O
group O
I O
patient. B-Species
However, O
the O
urinary O
organic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
blood O
spot O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
profiles O
under O
stable O
conditions O
differed O
between O
the O
two O
groups. O
The O
group O
I O
patient B-Species
had O
typical O
profiles O
for O
the O
T2 B-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
In O
contrast, O
in O
all O
four O
patients B-Species
in O
group O
II, O
tiglylglycine B-Chemical
was O
not O
or O
was O
only O
faintly O
detected O
and O
the O
2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate B-Chemical
levels O
were O
less O
than O
the O
cutoff O
value. O
Their O
tiglylcarnitine B-Chemical
levels O
were O
within O
the O
normal O
range O
and O
2-methyl-3-hydroxy-, B-Chemical
butyrylcarnitine I-Chemical
was O
detected O
just O
around O
the O
cutoff O
value O
in O
our O
newborn O
screening O
pilot O
test. O
Hence, O
these O
analyses O
under O
stable O
conditions O
are O
not O
reliable O
for O
diagnosing O
the O
T2 B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
in O
the O
group O
II O
patients. B-Species
The O
T2 B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
(group O
II) O
can O
be O
misdiagnosed O
as O
normal O
if O
these O
analyses O
are O
performed O
under O
nonepisodic O
conditions O
and O
possibly O
during O
the O
newborn O
screening O
for O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
of I-Disease
metabolism. I-Disease
