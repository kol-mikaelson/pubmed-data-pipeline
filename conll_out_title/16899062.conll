# Abstract
N-arachidonyl-glycine B-Chemical
is O
one O
of O
a O
series O
of O
N-arachidonyl-amino B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
that O
are O
derived O
from O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
N-arachidonyl-glycine B-Chemical
is O
produced O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
tissues O
with O
greatest O
abundance O
in O
the O
spinal O
cord. O
Here O
we O
report O
that O
N-arachidonyl-glycine B-Chemical
is O
a O
reversible O
and O
non-competitive O
inhibitor O
of O
glycine B-Chemical
transport O
by O
GLYT2a, O
but O
has O
little O
effect O
on O
glycine B-Chemical
transport O
by O
GLYT1b O
or O
gamma-amino O
butyric O
acid O
transport O
by O
GAT1. B-Gene
It O
has O
previously O
been O
reported O
that O
the O
activity O
of O
GLYT2a O
is O
down-regulated O
by O
protein O
kinase O
C O
and O
therefore O
we O
investigated O
whether O
the O
actions O
of O
N-arachidonyl-glycine B-Chemical
on O
GLYT2a O
are O
mediated O
by O
second O
messenger O
systems O
that O
lead O
to O
the O
activation O
of O
protein O
kinase O
C. O
However, O
the O
protein O
kinase O
C O
inhibitor, O
staurosporine, B-Chemical
had O
no O
effect O
on O
the O
actions O
of O
N-arachidonyl-glycine B-Chemical
on O
GLYT2a. O
Thus, O
the O
actions O
of O
N-arachidonyl-glycine B-Chemical
are O
likely O
to O
be O
mediated O
by O
a O
direct O
interaction O
with O
the O
transporter. O
We O
have O
further O
defined O
the O
pharmacophore O
by O
investigating O
the O
actions O
of O
other O
N-arachidonyl B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
the O
closely O
related O
compounds O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
anandamide B-Chemical
and O
R1-methanandamide. B-Chemical
Arachidonic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
anandamide B-Chemical
and O
R1-methanandamide B-Chemical
have O
no O
effect O
on O
glycine B-Chemical
transport, O
but O
N-arachidonyl-l-alanine B-Chemical
has O
similar O
efficacy O
at O
GLYT2a O
to O
N-arachidonyl-glycine, B-Chemical
and O
N-arachidonyl-gamma-amino O
butyric O
acid O
is O
less O
efficacious. O
These O
observations O
define O
a O
novel O
recognition O
site O
for O
the O
N-arachidonyl B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
