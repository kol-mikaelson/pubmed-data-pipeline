# Abstract
m-Hydroxyphenylacetic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(mHPA), B-Chemical
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(DHPA), B-Chemical
and O
4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(HMPA) B-Chemical
are O
major O
microbial O
metabolites O
of O
quercetin. B-Chemical
After O
administration O
of O
quercetin B-Chemical
to O
human B-Species
subjects, O
these O
metabolites O
are O
readily O
detected O
in O
blood O
and O
urine. O
mHPA, B-Chemical
DHPA, B-Chemical
and O
HMPA B-Chemical
are O
thought O
to O
exert O
protective O
biological O
activity O
within O
the O
body O
due O
to O
their O
antioxidant O
properties. O
However, O
very O
little O
work O
has O
been O
published O
concerning O
their O
absorption. O
I O
have O
examined O
the O
absorption O
characteristics O
of O
the O
quercetin B-Chemical
metabolites O
in O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
by O
a O
coulometric O
detection O
method O
using O
HPLC-ECD. O
All O
of O
them O
exhibited O
nonsaturable O
transport O
in O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
up O
to O
30 O
mM, O
whereas O
HMPA B-Chemical
and O
mHPA B-Chemical
also O
showed O
proton-coupled O
polarized O
absorption. O
The O
proton-coupled O
directional O
transport O
of O
HMPA B-Chemical
and O
mHPA B-Chemical
was O
inhibited O
by O
the O
substrate O
of O
the O
monocarboxylic B-Gene
acid I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
(MCT). B-Gene
A O
considerable O
amount O
of O
apically O
loaded O
HMPA B-Chemical
and O
mHPA B-Chemical
was O
taken O
up O
and O
transported O
through O
to O
the O
basolateral O
side, O
while O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
apically O
loaded O
DHPA B-Chemical
was O
retained O
on O
the O
apical O
side. O
Furthermore, O
the O
transepithelial O
flux O
of O
DHPA B-Chemical
was O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
the O
paracellular O
permeability O
of O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells, O
although O
those O
of O
HMPA B-Chemical
and O
mHPA B-Chemical
were O
almost O
constant. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
transport O
of O
DHPA B-Chemical
was O
mainly O
via O
paracellular O
diffusion, O
although O
HMPA B-Chemical
and O
mHPA B-Chemical
were O
absorbed O
to O
some O
extent O
by O
the O
MCT. B-Gene
