# Abstract
PURPOSE: O
Sugars B-Chemical
in O
the O
aqueous O
humour O
of O
the O
eye O
serve O
both O
as O
a O
source O
of O
nutrients O
to O
the O
lens O
and O
other O
anterior O
ocular O
tissues, O
and O
potentially O
as O
an O
indicator O
of O
waste O
products O
from O
these O
tissues. O
In O
this O
work O
we O
intended O
to O
measure O
the O
levels O
of O
sugars B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
blood O
and O
aqueous O
humour O
from O
cataract B-Disease
patients B-Species
with O
and O
without O
diabetes. B-Disease
After O
initial O
results O
we O
decided O
to O
identify O
an O
unknown O
sugar B-Chemical
component. O
METHODS: O
Sugars B-Chemical
were O
measured O
by O
hplc. O
The O
unknown O
sugar B-Chemical
peak O
was O
identified O
by O
gas O
chromatography O
mass O
spectrometry O
RESULTS: O
Very O
little O
fructose B-Chemical
and O
sorbitol B-Chemical
were O
found. O
Glucose B-Chemical
levels O
were O
higher O
in O
both O
blood O
and O
aqueous O
from O
diabetic B-Disease
patients. B-Species
During O
these O
analyses O
we O
found O
a O
major O
component O
that O
did O
not O
correspond O
to O
any O
sugar B-Chemical
reported O
previously O
in O
aqueous O
humour. O
This O
was O
identified O
as O
a O
mixture O
of O
threonic B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
erythronic I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
CONCLUSIONS: O
Glucose B-Chemical
levels O
increase O
in O
human B-Species
aqueous O
humour O
in O
diabetes B-Disease
without O
markedly O
raised O
levels O
of O
sorbitol B-Chemical
or O
fructose. B-Chemical
Erythronic B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
threonic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
normal O
components O
of O
aqueous O
humour O
and O
blood. O
They O
may O
be O
derived O
from O
glycated O
proteins O
or O
from O
degradation O
of O
ascorbic O
acid. O
