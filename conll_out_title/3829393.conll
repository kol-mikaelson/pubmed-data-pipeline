# Abstract
We O
evaluated O
for O
reliability O
and O
reproducibility O
a O
semiquantitative O
gas-chromatographic O
assay O
of O
organic O
acids O
in O
samples O
of O
normal O
urine O
recovered O
from O
absorbent O
filter O
paper. O
We O
also O
evaluated O
this O
method O
for O
use O
in O
diagnosis O
of O
some O
of O
the O
more O
common O
organic O
acidurias. O
Transfer O
of O
urine O
from O
diapers O
to O
absorbent O
filter O
paper O
eases O
the O
usual O
trauma O
of O
specimen O
collection O
from O
young O
children; O
it O
also O
simplifies O
sample O
storage O
and O
shipment. O
