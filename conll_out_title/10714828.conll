# Abstract
Although O
the O
process O
of O
glycolysis O
is O
highly O
conserved O
in O
eukaryotes, O
several O
glycolytic O
enzymes O
have O
unique O
structural O
or O
functional O
features O
in O
spermatogenic O
cells. O
We O
previously O
identified O
and O
characterized O
the O
mouse B-Species
complementary O
DNA O
(cDNA) O
and O
a O
gene O
for O
1 O
of O
these O
enzymes, O
glyceraldehyde B-Gene
3-phosphate I-Gene
dehydrogenase-s I-Gene
(Gapds). B-Gene
This O
gene O
is O
expressed O
only O
in O
spermatids. O
The O
enzyme O
appears O
to O
have O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
energy O
production O
required O
for O
fertilization, O
and O
it O
is O
reported O
to O
be O
susceptible O
to O
inhibition O
by O
certain O
environmental O
chemicals. O
We O
have O
now O
cloned O
and O
sequenced O
the O
cDNA O
for O
the O
human B-Species
homologue O
of O
glyceraldehyde B-Gene
3-phosphate I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(GAPD2) B-Gene
and O
determined O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
gene. O
The O
messenger O
RNA O
(mRNA) O
was O
detected O
in O
testis, O
but O
not O
in O
15 O
other O
human B-Species
tissues O
analyzed O
by O
Northern O
blot O
technique. O
The O
deduced O
GAPD2 B-Gene
protein O
contains O
408 O
amino O
acids O
and O
is O
68% O
identical O
with O
somatic O
cell O
GAPD. B-Gene
GAPD2 B-Gene
has O
a O
72-amino O
acid O
segment O
at O
the O
amino O
terminal O
end O
that O
is O
not O
present O
in O
somatic O
cell O
GAPD. B-Gene
This O
segment O
is O
proline-rich O
but O
contains O
smaller O
stretches O
of O
polyproline O
and O
is O
30 O
amino O
acids O
shorter O
than O
the O
comparable O
segment O
of O
mouse B-Species
GAPDS. B-Gene
The O
structure O
of O
the O
human B-Species
GAPD2 B-Gene
gene O
was O
determined O
by O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
(PCR) O
to O
identify O
exon-intron O
junctions O
in O
a O
genomic O
clone O
and O
in O
total O
genomic O
DNA. O
The O
locations O
of O
these O
junctions O
in O
the O
GAPD2 B-Gene
gene O
corresponded O
precisely O
to O
those O
of O
the O
11 O
exon-intron O
junctions O
in O
the O
mouse B-Species
Gapds B-Gene
gene. O
Immunohistochemical O
studies O
found O
that O
GAPD2 B-Gene
is O
located O
in O
the O
principal O
piece O
of O
the O
flagellum O
of O
human B-Species
spermatozoa, O
as O
are O
GAPDS B-Gene
in O
mouse B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
spermatozoa. O
GAPD2 B-Gene
extracted O
from O
human B-Species
spermatozoa O
and O
analyzed O
by O
Western O
blot O
technique O
migrated O
with O
an O
apparent O
molecular O
weight O
of O
approximately O
56,000, O
although O
the O
calculated O
molecular O
weight O
is O
44 O
501. O
The O
conserved O
nature O
of O
the O
mouse, B-Species
rat, B-Species
and O
human B-Species
enzymes O
suggests O
that O
they O
serve O
similar O
roles O
in O
these O
and O
other O
mammalian O
species. O
