# Abstract
Leukotrienes B-Chemical
(LTs) B-Chemical
are O
the O
ultimate O
synthetic O
product O
resulting O
from O
the O
intracellular O
hydrolysis O
of O
membrane O
phospholipid B-Chemical
at O
the O
nuclear O
envelope O
in O
inflammatory B-Disease
cells. O
Activated O
cytosolic O
phospholipase O
(cPLA2) B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
production O
of O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
which O
is O
converted O
by O
cyclooxygenases O
into O
leukotriene B-Chemical
A4 I-Chemical
(LTA4) B-Chemical
and O
subsequently O
into O
the O
chemotaxin O
LTB4, B-Chemical
which O
has O
no O
direct O
bronchoconstrictor O
activity. O
In O
certain O
inflammatory B-Disease
cells, O
LTA4 B-Chemical
is O
converted O
into O
the O
cysteinyl B-Chemical
leukotriene B-Chemical
(cysLT) B-Chemical
LTC4, B-Chemical
which O
is O
converted O
into O
LTD4 B-Chemical
and O
finally O
to O
LTE4 B-Chemical
after O
extracellular O
transport. O
All O
cysLTs O
occupy O
the O
same O
receptors O
and O
are O
extremely O
potent O
bronchoconstricting O
agents O
that O
are O
pathogenetic O
in O
both O
asthma B-Disease
and O
allergy. B-Disease
With O
the O
identification O
of O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
cysLT B-Chemical
receptor, O
antileukotriene O
therapies O
have O
been O
developed O
that O
either O
(a) O
inhibit O
synthesis O
of O
leukotriene B-Chemical
(through O
5-lipoxygenase B-Gene
inhibition) O
or O
(b) O
block O
the O
cysLT B-Chemical
receptor. O
Preliminary O
investigations O
indicate O
that O
corticosteroids O
also O
may O
partially O
block O
the O
synthesis O
of O
cysLT B-Chemical
and O
that O
cysLTs O
may O
be O
chemotactic O
for O
other O
inflammatory B-Disease
cells, O
e.g. O
eosinophils, O
by O
a O
mechanism O
that O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
defined. O
Currently, O
anti-LT O
therapies O
are O
approved O
by O
the O
US O
Food O
and O
Drug O
Administration O
(FDA) O
only O
for O
patients B-Species
with O
asthma. B-Disease
These O
drugs O
generally O
are O
moderately O
efficacious O
agents, O
although O
they O
are O
highly O
efficacious O
in O
aspirin-induced O
asthma B-Disease
(AIA). B-Disease
In O
other O
forms O
of O
asthma, B-Disease
inhaled B-Chemical
corticosteroid I-Chemical
(ICS) B-Chemical
therapy O
has O
been O
more O
effective O
than O
anti-LT O
therapy O
in O
improving O
air B-Disease
flow I-Disease
obstruction. I-Disease
However, O
anti-LT O
agents O
are O
additive O
to O
beta-adrenoceptor O
and O
ICS B-Chemical
in O
their O
effects. O
Accordingly, O
anti-LT O
therapies O
are O
used O
frequently O
as O
supplemental O
treatments O
in O
asthmatic B-Disease
patients B-Species
whose O
asthma B-Disease
is O
not O
optimally O
controlled O
by O
a O
combination O
of O
other O
drugs, O
including O
long-acting O
beta-adrenoceptor B-Chemical
drugs I-Chemical
and O
ICS B-Chemical
agents. O
The O
growth O
of O
leukotriene B-Chemical
receptor O
antagonists O
(LTRAs) O
has O
been O
extraordinary O
in O
the O
United O
States. O
The O
exceptional O
safety O
of O
these O
agents O
and O
their O
ease O
of O
administration O
as O
tablets O
taken O
once O
or O
twice O
daily O
has O
spurred O
this O
growth. O
In O
the O
past O
year, O
the O
high-affinity O
cysLT B-Chemical
receptor O
has O
been O
cloned. O
This O
holds O
forth O
the O
promise O
of O
a O
second O
generation O
of O
LTRA O
agents O
of O
even O
greater O
efficacy O
and O
possibly O
greater O
duration O
of O
action. O
