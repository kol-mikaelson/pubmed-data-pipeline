# Abstract
Hemizygous O
cryptic O
deletions O
of O
the O
q11 O
band O
of O
human B-Species
chromosome B-Chromosome
22 I-Chromosome
have O
been O
associated O
with O
a O
number O
of O
psychiatric B-Disease
and O
behavioural O
phenotypes, O
including O
schizophrenia. B-Disease
Here O
we O
report O
the O
isolation O
and O
characterization O
of O
PRODH, B-Gene
a O
human B-Species
homologue O
of O
Drosophila B-Species
melanogaster I-Species
sluggish-A B-Gene
(slgA), B-Gene
which O
encodes O
proline B-Chemical
dehydrogenase I-Gene
responsible O
for O
the O
behavioural O
phenotype O
of O
the O
slgA B-Gene
mutant. O
PRODH B-Gene
is O
localized O
at O
chromosome B-Chromosome
22q11 B-Chromosome
in O
a O
region O
deleted O
in O
some O
psychiatric B-Disease
patients. B-Species
We O
also O
isolated O
the O
mouse B-Species
homologue O
of O
slgA B-Gene
(Prodh), B-Gene
identified O
a O
mutation O
in O
this O
gene O
in O
the O
Pro O
Re O
hyperprolinaemic B-Disease
mouse B-Species
strain O
and O
found O
that O
these O
mice B-Species
have O
a O
deficit O
in O
sensorimotor O
gating O
accompanied O
by O
regional O
neurochemical O
alterations O
in O
the O
brain. O
Sensorimotor O
gating O
is O
a O
neural O
filtering O
process O
that O
allows O
attention O
to O
be O
focused O
on O
a O
given O
stimulus, O
and O
is O
affected O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
neuropsychiatric B-Disease
disorders. I-Disease
Furthermore, O
several O
lines O
of O
evidence O
suggest O
that O
proline B-Chemical
may O
serve O
as O
a O
modulator O
of O
synaptic O
transmission O
in O
the O
mammalian O
brain. O
Our O
observations, O
in O
conjunction O
with O
the O
chromosomal O
location O
of O
PRODH, B-Gene
suggest O
a O
potential O
involvement O
of O
this O
gene O
in O
the O
22q11-associated O
psychiatric B-Disease
and O
behavioural O
phenotypes. O
