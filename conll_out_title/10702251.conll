# Abstract
It O
is O
suggested O
that O
formation O
of O
more O
polar O
metabolites O
of O
all-trans-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(atRA) B-Chemical
via O
oxidative O
pathways O
limits O
its O
biological O
activity. O
In O
this O
report, O
we O
investigated O
the O
biotransformation O
of O
oxidized O
products O
of O
atRA B-Chemical
via O
glucuronidation. O
For O
this O
purpose, O
we O
synthesized O
4-hydroxy-RA B-Chemical
(4-OH-RA) B-Chemical
in O
radioactive O
and O
nonradioactive O
form, O
4-hydroxy-retinyl B-Chemical
acetate I-Chemical
(4-OH-RAc), B-Chemical
and O
5,6-epoxy-RA, B-Chemical
all O
of O
which O
are O
major O
products O
of O
atRA B-Chemical
oxidation. O
Glucuronidation O
of O
these O
retinoids B-Chemical
by O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
and O
human B-Species
recombinant O
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases B-Gene
(UGTs) B-Gene
was O
characterized O
and O
compared O
with O
the O
glucuronidation O
of O
atRA. B-Chemical
The O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
glucuronidated O
4-OH-RA B-Chemical
and O
4-OH-RAc B-Chemical
with O
6- O
and O
3-fold O
higher O
activity O
than O
atRA, B-Chemical
respectively. O
Analysis O
of O
the O
glucuronidation O
products O
showed O
that O
the O
hydroxyl-linked O
glucuronides B-Chemical
of O
4-OH-RA B-Chemical
and O
4-OH-RAc B-Chemical
were O
the O
major O
products, O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
carboxyl-linked O
glucuronide B-Chemical
with O
atRA, B-Chemical
4-oxo-RA, B-Chemical
and O
5,6-epoxy-RA. B-Chemical
We O
have O
also O
determined O
that O
human B-Species
recombinant O
UGT2B7 B-Gene
can O
glucuronidate O
atRA, B-Chemical
4-OH-RA, B-Chemical
and O
4-OH-RAc B-Chemical
with O
activities O
similar O
to O
those O
found O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes. O
We O
therefore O
postulate O
that O
this O
human B-Species
isoenzyme, O
which O
is O
expressed O
in O
human B-Species
liver, O
kidney, O
and O
intestine, O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
the O
biological O
fate O
of O
atRA. B-Chemical
We O
also O
propose O
that O
atRA B-Chemical
induces O
its O
own O
oxidative O
metabolism O
via O
a O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP26) B-Gene
and O
is O
further O
biotransformed O
into O
glucuronides B-Chemical
via O
UGT-mediated O
pathways. O
