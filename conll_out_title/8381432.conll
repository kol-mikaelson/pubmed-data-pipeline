# Abstract
Investigation O
on O
the O
biochemical O
isomerization O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
led O
us O
to O
the O
successful O
purification O
of O
"2-arylpropionyl-CoA B-Gene
epimerase" I-Gene
from O
rat B-Species
liver O
cytosol O
and O
mitochondria. O
The O
purified O
enzymes O
from O
both O
subcellular O
fractions O
exhibit O
similar O
physical O
and O
catalytic O
properties O
and O
are O
distinctly O
different O
from O
rat B-Species
liver O
methylmalonyl-CoA B-Gene
epimerase. I-Gene
Both O
are O
monomeric O
proteins O
with O
an O
apparent O
molecular O
mass O
of O
42 O
kDa O
and O
show O
similar O
contents O
of O
most O
amino O
acids. O
Their O
UV O
spectra O
gave O
no O
indication O
of O
any O
bound O
cofactors, O
and O
their O
enzyme O
activities O
were O
not O
affected O
by O
exposure O
to O
EDTA B-Chemical
or O
metal O
ions O
(except O
Cu2+). B-Chemical
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
cytosolic O
and O
mitochondrial O
epimerases O
may O
be O
structurally O
related. O
The O
purified O
enzymes O
catalyze O
the O
epimerization O
of O
various O
2-arylpropionyl-CoAs O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
stereochemical O
differentiation. O
For O
2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionyl-CoA, O
the O
equilibrium O
constant O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
1.5 O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
R-isomer. O
Evidence O
indicated O
that O
the O
proton O
exchange O
may O
be O
mediated O
by O
a O
2-base O
mechanism O
and O
that O
a O
carboxylic O
residue O
in O
the O
active O
site O
may O
serve O
as O
a O
general O
base O
for O
proton O
abstraction. O
