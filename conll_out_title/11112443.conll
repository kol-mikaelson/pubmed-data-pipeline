# Abstract
Mammalian-secreted O
phospholipases O
A(2) O
(sPLA(2)) B-Gene
form O
a O
diverse O
family O
of O
at O
least O
nine O
enzymes O
that O
hydrolyze O
phospholipids B-Chemical
to O
release O
free B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
lysophospholipids. B-Chemical
We O
report O

Finally, O
recombinant O

hGIIF O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
in O
Escherichia B-Species

is O
Ca(2+)-dependent, O
maximally O

at O
pH O
7-8, O
