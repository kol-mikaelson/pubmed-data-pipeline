The O
pectins B-Chemical

were O
a O
calcium-sensitive O
pectin B-Chemical
(CS-pectin) B-Chemical
that O

a O
high O

and O
a O
noncalcium-sensitive O
pectin B-Chemical
(NCS-pectin) B-Chemical
that O
has O
a O
low O

In O
the O
presence O
of O
calcium, B-Chemical
CS-pectin B-Chemical
has O
a O
more O
