we O
showed O
that O
carboxyl B-Gene
ester I-Gene
lipase I-Gene
(CEL)-deficient O

have O
normal O

In O
the O

study, O
we O
further O
investigated O
this O
non-CEL O
REH B-Gene
activity O
in O
pancreas O

of O
CELKO O
and O
wild-type O
(WT) O
mice, B-Species

rats. B-Species
REH B-Gene

was O
detected O
in O
both O

of O

In O
contrast, O
pancreatic B-Gene
cholesteryl B-Chemical

(CEH) B-Gene
activity O
was O
only O
detected O
in O

Enzyme O

Pancreatic B-Gene
enzyme O

related O
to O
either O

In O
both O
rats B-Species

mice B-Species
(WT O

CELKO), O
REH B-Gene

could O
be O
attributed O
mainly O
to O
PTL, B-Gene
and O
to O
a O

Finally, O
purified O

PTL B-Gene
exhibited O
similar O
enzymatic O
characteristics O
for O
triglyceride B-Chemical
hydrolysis O
as O
well O
as O
for O
retinyl B-Chemical

hydrolysis, O
indicating O
that O
RE B-Chemical
is O
a O
substrate O
for O
PTL B-Gene
in O

Altogether, O
these O
studies O
clearly O
show O
that O
PTL B-Gene
is O
the O
major O

in O
