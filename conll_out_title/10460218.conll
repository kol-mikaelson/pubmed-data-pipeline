# Abstract
Human B-Species
semen O
contains O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
activity, O
the O
great O
majority O
of O
which O
is O
found O
in O
the O
seminal O
fluid. O
Immunocytochemical O
studies O
indicate O
that O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
semen O
fucosidase O
activity O
is O
present O
on O
the O
sperm O
plasma O
membrane, O
primarily O
in O
the O
posterior O
head O
region. O
Subcellular O
fractionation O
studies O
also O
indicate O
that O
sperm O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
is O
present O
in O
the O
plasma O
membrane-enriched O
fraction. O
Comparative O
characterization O
of O
human B-Species
seminal O
fluid O
and O
sperm O
alpha-L-fucosidases O
indicates O
that O
seminal O
fluid O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
has O
a O
broad O
pH O
optimum O
curve O
with O
a O
number O
of O
near-equal O
maxima O
between O
pH O
4.8 O
and O
7.0 O
while O
sperm O
fucosidase O
has O
a O
major O
optimum O
between O
pH O
3.4 O
and O
4.0. O
Isoelectric O
focusing O
indicates O
that O
seminal O
fluid O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
contains O
three O
to O
six O
isoforms O
with O
isoelectric O
points O
(pI) O
of O
5-7 O
while O
sperm O
fucosidase O
contains O
two O
distinct O
isoforms O
with O
pI O
values O
of O
5. O
2 O
+ O
- O
0.2 O

Western O
blotting O
indicates O
that O
seminal O
fluid O
fucosidase O
contains O
a O
major O
protein O
band O
with O
a O
molecular O
mass O
ratio O
(M(r)) O
of O
approximately O
56 O
kDa O
while O
sperm O
fucosidase O
contains O
a O
major O
protein O
band O
of O
approximately O
51 O
kDa. O
The O
overall O
results O
indicate O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
low-abundance, O
plasma O
membrane-associated O
human B-Species
sperm O
alpha-L-fucosidase, O
which O
is O
different O
in O
its O
properties O
from O
human B-Species
seminal O
fluid O
alpha-L-fucosidase(s), O
and O
whose O
function O
is O
not O
yet O
known. O
