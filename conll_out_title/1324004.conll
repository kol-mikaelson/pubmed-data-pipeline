# Abstract
Taurine, B-Chemical
a O
sulfated O
beta-amino B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
is O
conditionally O
essential O
during O
development. O
A O
maternal O
supply O
of O
taurine B-Chemical
is O
necessary O
for O
normal O
fetal O
growth O
and O
neurologic O
development, O
suggesting O
the O
importance O
of O
efficient O
placental O
transfer. O
Uptake O
by O
the O
brush-border O
membrane O
(BBM) O
in O
several O
other O
tissues O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
via O
a O
selective O
Na(+)-dependent O
carrier O
mechanism O
which O
also O
has O
a O

requirement. O
Using O
BBM O

purified O
from O
the O
human B-Species

we O
have O
confirmed O
the O

of O
Na(+)-dependent, O

the O

Uptake O

reduced O
when O

such O

thiocyanate, B-Chemical

In O

a O

(under O

A O

We O
conclude O
that O
Na(+)-dependent O
taurine B-Chemical
uptake O

the O

has O
a O
