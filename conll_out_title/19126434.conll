# Abstract
Endocannabinoids B-Chemical
(endogenous O
ligands O
of O
cannabinoid O
receptors) O
exert O
diverse O
physiological O
and O
pathophysiological O
functions O
in O
animal O
tissues. O
N-Arachidonoylethanolamine B-Chemical
(anandamide) B-Chemical
and O
2-arachidonoylglycerol B-Chemical
(2-AG) B-Chemical
are O
two O
representative O
endocannabinoids. B-Chemical
Both O
the O
compounds O
are O
arachidonic O
acid-containing O
lipid B-Chemical
molecules O
generated O
from O
membrane O
glycerophospholipids, B-Chemical
but O
their O
biosynthetic O
pathways O
are O
totally O
different. O
Anandamide B-Chemical
is O
principally O
formed O
together O
with O
other O
N-acylethanolamines B-Chemical
(NAEs) B-Chemical
in O
a O
two-step O
pathway, O
which O
is O
composed O
of O
Ca(2+)-dependent O
N-acyltransferase O
and O
N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing B-Gene
phospholipase I-Gene
D I-Gene
(NAPE-PLD). B-Gene
cDNA O
cloning O
of O
NAPE-PLD B-Gene
and O
subsequent O
analysis O
of O
its O
gene-disrupted O
mice B-Species
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
alternative O
pathways O
comprising O
multiple O
enzymes. O
As O
for O
the O
2-AG B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
recent O
results, O
including O
cDNA O
cloning O
of O
diacylglycerol O
lipase O
and O
analyses O
of O
phospholipase O
Cbeta-deficient O
mice, B-Species
demonstrated O
that O
these O
two O
enzymes O
are O
responsible O
for O
the O
in O
vivo O
formation O
of O
2-AG B-Chemical
functioning O
as O
a O
retrograde O
messenger O
in O
synapses. O
In O
this O
review O
article, O
we O
will O
focus O
on O
recent O
progress O
in O
the O
studies O
on O
the O
enzymes O
responsible O
for O
the O
endocannabinoid B-Chemical
biosyntheses. O
