# Abstract
PURPOSE: O
To O
determine O
whether O
female O
sex-steroid O
hormones O
and O
their O
metabolites O
can O
modulate O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
(P-gp) B-Gene
expression O
and O
catalytic O
activity O
and O
to O
investigate O
P-gp B-Gene
mediated O
transport O
of O
these O
sex-steroids O
across O
MDR1-transfected O
Madine-Darby B-CellLine
canine I-CellLine
kidney I-CellLine
(MDCK) B-CellLine
cells. O
METHODS: O
Changes O

P-gp B-Gene
protein O

MDR1 B-Gene
mRNA O
expression O
levels O
were O
examined O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
various O
estrogens O
and O
progestins O
after O
a O

a O
recombinant O
baculovirus B-Species

with O
appropriate O

membranes. O
MDCK B-CellLine
and O
MDR1-transfected O
MDCK B-CellLine
cell O

were O
then O
used O
to O
measure O
bidirectional O
P-gp B-Gene

steroids B-Chemical
in O
the O
presence O
and O
absence O
of O
the O
P-gp B-Gene
inhibitor, O
GG918. B-Chemical
Samples O
obtained O
were O
quantified O
using O

RESULTS: O
Our O
findings O
show O
that O
P-gp B-Gene
protein O
levels O
are O
inducible O
by O
estrone B-Chemical
(4-fold O
over O
control), O
estriol B-Chemical
(2-fold), O
and O
ethynyl B-Chemical
estradiol I-Chemical
(3-fold). O
MDR1 B-Gene

levels O
were O
also O
inducible O
in O
a O
concentration-dependent O
manner O
from O
25 O
nM O
to O
10 O
microM. O
Bidirectional O
transport O
studies O
indicate O
that O
ethynyl B-Chemical
estradiol, I-Chemical
estrone, B-Chemical
and O
estriol B-Chemical
are O
all O
substrates O
for O
P-gp B-Gene
with O
respective O

found O
to O
be O
a O
substrate O

P-gp. B-Gene
Ethynyl B-Chemical
estradiol I-Chemical

were O
able O
to O
significantly O
stimulate O
P-gp B-Gene
ATPase O

in O
a O
concentration-dependent O
manner. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
studies O
indicate O
that O
several O
sex-steroid O
hormones O
are O
substrates O
for O
P-gp-mediated O
transport O

are O
also O
able O
to O
induce O

expression O
at O
both O
