# Abstract
Lysophosphatidylcholine B-Chemical
(LPC) B-Chemical
is O
a O
bioactive O
proinflammatory B-Chemical
lipid I-Chemical
generated O
by O
pathological O
activities. O
LPC B-Chemical
is O
also O
a O
major O
phospholipid B-Chemical
component O
of O
oxidized O
low-density O
lipoprotein O
(Ox-LDL) O
and O
is O
implicated O
as O
a O
critical O
factor O
in O
the O
atherogenic B-Disease
activity O
of O
Ox-LDL. O
LPC B-Chemical
is O
believed O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
atherosclerosis B-Disease
and O
inflammatory B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
by O
altering O
various O
functions O
in O
a O
number O
of O
cell-types, O
including O
endothelial O
cells, O
smooth O
muscle O
cells, O
monocytes, O
macrophages, O
and O
T-cells. O
LPC B-Chemical
activates O
several O
second O
messengers O
-- O
including O
protein O
kinase O
C, O
extracellular-signal-regulated O
kinases, O
protein O
tyrosine O
kinases, O
and O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
-- O
implicating O
the O
engagement O
of O
transduction O
mechanisms O
in O
its O
observed O
actions. O
Moreover, O
recent O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
in O
several O
cell-types, O
cloned O
orphan O
G-protein-coupled O
receptors O
may O
serve O
as O
the O
specific O
receptors O
via O
which O
LPC B-Chemical
modulates O
second O
messenger O
pathways O
(although O
LPC B-Chemical
may O
not O
be O
a O
direct O
ligand O
of O
such O
receptors). O
In O
addition, O
current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
LPC B-Chemical
impairs O
the O
endothelium-dependent O
relaxations O
mediated O
by O
endothelium-derived O
relaxing O
factors O
and O
directly O
modulates O
contractile O
responses O
in O
vascular O
smooth O
muscle. O
However, O
despite O
all O
this, O
and O
although O
elevated O
levels O
of O
LPC B-Chemical
have O
been O
linked O
to O
the O
cardiovascular B-Disease
complications I-Disease
associated O
with O
atherosclerosis, B-Disease
ischemia, B-Disease
and O
diabetes, B-Disease
the O
precise O
pathophysiological O
roles O
played O
by O
LPC B-Chemical
in O
several O
states O
remain O
to O
be O
established. O
In O
this O
review, O
we O
focus O
in O
some O
detail O
on O
the O
entirety O
of O
the O
signal-transduction O
system O
for O
LPC, B-Chemical
its O
pathophysiological O
implications, O
and O
the O
vascular B-Disease
abnormalities I-Disease
associated O
with O
it. O
