# Abstract
Diseases O
like O
obesity, B-Disease
diabetes B-Disease
or O
generalized O
lipodystrophy B-Disease
cause O
a O
chronic O
elevation O
of O
circulating O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
that O
can O
become O
cytotoxic, O
a O
condition O
known O
as O
lipotoxicity. B-Disease
Fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
cause O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
alterations O
in O
mitochondrial O
structure O
and O
function. O
The O
uncoupling O
of O
the O
oxidative O
phosphorylation O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
recognized O
deleterious O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
effects O
and O
several O
metabolite O
transporters O
are O
known O
to O
mediate O
in O
their O
action. O
The O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
interaction O
with O
the O
carriers O
leads O
to O
membrane O
depolarization O
and O
or O
the O
conversion O
of O
the O
carrier O
into O
a O
pore. O
The O
result O
is O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
permeability O
transition O
pore O
and O
the O
initiation O
of O
apoptosis. O
Unlike O
the O
other O
members O
of O
the O
mitochondrial O
carrier O
superfamily, O
the O
eutherian O
uncoupling O
protein O
UCP1 B-Gene
has O
evolved O
to O
achieve O
its O
heat-generating O
capacity O
in O
the O
physiological O
context O
provided O
by O
the O
brown O
adipocyte O
and O
therefore O
it O
is O
activated O
by O
the O
low O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
concentrations O
generated O
by O
the O
noradrenaline-stimulated O
lipolysis. O
