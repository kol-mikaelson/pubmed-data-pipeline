# Abstract
The O
human B-Species
organic O
anion O
transporting O
polypeptide O
2B1 O
(OATP2B1, B-Gene
SLCO2B1) B-Gene
is O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
and O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
disposition O
of O
xenobiotics. O
The O
present O
study O
aimed O
to O
examine O
the O
role O
of O
OATP2B1 B-Gene
in O
the O
intestinal O
absorption O
and O
tissue O
uptake O
of O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme O
A O
(HMG-CoA) O
reductase O
inhibitors O
(statins). B-Chemical
We O
first O
investigated O
the O
functional O
affinity O
of O
statins B-Chemical
to O
the O
transporter O
as O
a O
function O
of O
extracellular O
pH, O
using O
OATP2B1-transfeced O
HEK293 B-CellLine
cells. O
The O
results O
indicate O
that O
OATP2B1-mediated O
transport O
is O
significant O
for O
rosuvastatin, B-Chemical
fluvastatin B-Chemical
and O
atorvastatin, B-Chemical
at O
neutral O
pH. O
However, O
OATP2B1 B-Gene
showed O
broader O
substrate O
specificity O
as O
well O
as O
enhanced O
transporter O
activity O
at O
acidic O
pH. O
Furthermore, O
uptake O
at O
acidic O
pH O
was O
diminished O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
proton O
ionophore, O
suggesting O
proton O
gradient O
as O
the O
driving O
force O
for O
OATP2B1 B-Gene
activity. O
Notably, O
passive O
transport O
rates O
are O
predominant O
or O
comparable O
to O
active O
transport O
rates O
for O
statins, B-Chemical
except O
for O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
and O
fluvastatin. B-Chemical
Second, O
we O
studied O
the O
effect O
of O
OATP B-Gene
modulators O
on O
statin B-Chemical
uptake. O
At O
pH O
6.0, O
OATP2B1-mediated O
transport O
of O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
and O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
was O
not O
inhibitable, O
while O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
transport O
was O
inhibited O
by O
E-3-S, B-Chemical
rifamycin B-Chemical
SV I-Chemical
and O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
with O
IC(50) O
values O
of O
19.7 O
+- O
3.3 O
muM, O
0.53 O
+- O
0.2 O
muM O
and O
2.2 O
+- O
0.4 O
muM, O
respectively. O
Rifamycin B-Chemical
SV I-Chemical
inhibited O
OATP2B1-mediated O
transport O
of O
E-3-S B-Chemical
and O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
with O
similar O
IC(50) O
values O
at O
pH O
6.0 O
and O
7.4, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
inhibitor O
affinity O
is O
not O
pH-dependent. O
Finally, O
we O
noted O
that O
OATP2B1-mediated O
transport O
of O
E-3-S, B-Chemical
but O
not O
rosuvastatin, B-Chemical
is O
pH O
sensitive O
in O
intestinal O
epithelial O
(Caco-2) B-CellLine
cells. O
However, O
uptake O
of O
E-3-S B-Chemical
and O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
by O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
diminished O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
proton O
ionophore. O
The O
present O
results O
indicate O
that O
OATP2B1 B-Gene
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
tissue O
uptake O
of O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
and O
fluvastatin, B-Chemical
while O
OATP2B1 B-Gene
may O
play O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
the O
intestinal O
absorption O
of O
several O
statins B-Chemical
due O
to O
their O
transporter O
affinity O
at O
acidic O
pH. O
