# Abstract
Human B-Species
GLUT11 B-Gene
(encoded O
by O
the O
solute O

2A11 O
gene, O
SLC2A11) B-Gene
is O
a O
novel O
sugar B-Chemical
transporter O
which O
exhibits O
significant O

with O
the O
members O
of O
the O
GLUT O
family. O
The O

essential O
for O
sugar-transport O
activity. O
The O

the O
fructose B-Chemical
transporter O
GLUT5 B-Gene
(sharing O
41.7% O
