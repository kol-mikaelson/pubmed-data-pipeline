# Abstract
The O
mechanism O
that O
removes O
homovanillic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(HVA), B-Chemical
an O
end O
metabolite O
of O
dopamine, B-Chemical
from O
the O
brain O
is O
still O
poorly O
understood. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
is O
to O
identify O
and O
characterize O
the O
brain-to-blood O
HVA B-Chemical
efflux O
transporter O
at O
the O
rat B-Species
blood-brain O
barrier O
(BBB). O
Using O

method, O
the O

of O
[3H]HVA B-Chemical

inhibited O
by O
several O
organic B-Chemical
anions, I-Chemical
such O

octanoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
metabolites O
of O
monoamine B-Chemical
neurotransmitters. I-Chemical
Neurotransmitters O
themselves O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
uptake. O
Furthermore, O
immunohistochemical O

suggested O
that O
rOAT3 B-Gene
is O
localized O
at O
the O
abluminal O

of O
brain O

These O
results O
provide O
the O
first O
evidence O
that O
rOAT3 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
at O
the O
abluminal O

HVA. B-Chemical
This O

play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
controlling O

the O
CNS. O
