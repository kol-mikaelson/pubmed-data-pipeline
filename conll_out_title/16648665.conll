# Abstract
Histamine B-Chemical
is O
inactivated O
by O
the O
histamine-metabolizing O
enzyme O
histamine B-Chemical
N-methyltransferase I-Gene
(HNMT) B-Gene
in O
bronchus, O
kidney, O
and O
the O
central O
nervous O
system. O
HNMT B-Gene
seems O
to O
be O
localized O
in O
the O
cytoplasm, O
but O
histamine B-Chemical
is O
unable O
to O
easily O
enter O
the O
intracellular O
space. O
Therefore, O
two O
hypotheses O
can O
be O
elicited: O
one O
is O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
hypothesis O
that O
HNMT B-Gene
can O
be O
translocated O
to O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
and O
function O
at O
the O
cell O
surface O
under O
growth O
factor O
stimulation O
and O
the O
other O
is O
the O
transporter O
hypothesis O
that O
organic B-Gene
cation I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
(OCT)-2 B-Gene
and I-Gene
-3 I-Gene
can O
function O
as O
a O
histamine B-Chemical
transporter O
as O
well. O
To O
investigate O
the O
involvement O
of O
OCT2, B-Gene
HEK293 B-CellLine
cells O
stably O
double O
transfected O
with O
C-terminal O
hemagglutinin O
(HA)-tagged O
HNMT B-Gene
cDNA O
and O
or O
C-terminal O
myc-tagged O
rat B-Species
OCT2 B-Gene
were O
prepared O
for O
analysis O
of O
HNMT B-Gene
activity O
associated O
with O
OCT2 B-Gene
function. O
After O
60-min O
incubation O
of O
these O
cells O
with O
PBS B-Chemical
including O
HA O
(100 O
microM), O
N(tau)-methylhistamine B-Chemical
(MHA) B-Chemical
concentration O
of O
the O
supernatants O
was O
determined O
by O
the O
HPLC-fluorometry O
method. O
MHA B-Chemical
from O
cells O
with O
HNMT B-Gene
plus O
OCT-2 B-Gene
was O
produced O
at O
about O
3-fold O
higher O
level O
than O
that O
from O
cells O
with O
HNMT B-Gene
alone, O
suggesting O
that O
OCT-2 B-Gene
could O
function O
as O
a O
histamine B-Chemical
transporter O
as O
well O
and O
that O
HNMT B-Gene
function O
could O
partly O
depend O
on O
OCT-2 B-Gene
transporter O
activity. O
Using O
OCT-3 B-Gene
knockout O
(OCT-3- B-Gene
-) O
mice, B-Species
histamine B-Chemical
content O
and O
survival O
rates O
were O
investigated O
in O
lipopolysaccharide B-Chemical
(LPS)-induced O
endotoxemia B-Disease
model. O
Without O
LPS B-Chemical
stimulation, O
histamine B-Chemical
content O
was O
compared O
between O
OCT-3- B-Gene
- O
and O
wild O
mice. B-Species
Histamine B-Chemical
content O
in O
the O
spleen O
of O
OCT-3- B-Gene
- O
mice B-Species
was O
higher O
than O
that O
f O
wild O
mice. B-Species
With O
LPS B-Chemical
stimulation, O
the O
survival O
rate O
of O
OCT-3- B-Gene
- O
mice B-Species
was O
significantly O
decreased O
12 O
h O
after O
LPS B-Chemical
(20 O
mg O
kg) O
stimulation, O
suggesting O
that O
before O
immunological O
stimulation, O
a O
higher O
content O
of O
histamine B-Chemical
in O
spleen O
could O
stimulate O
histamine B-Chemical
receptors O
in O
mast O
cells, O
macrophages, O
dendritic O
cells, O
as O
well O
as O
T O
lymphocytes O
and O
explaining O
the O
decreased O
survival O
rate O
in O
OCT-3- B-Gene
- O
mice B-Species
possibly O
due O
to O
the O
functional O
changes O
of O
immunological O
cells. O
