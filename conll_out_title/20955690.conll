# Abstract
The O
well-known O
analgesic O
and O
antipyretic O
drug O
N-acetyl-p-aminophenol B-Chemical
(acetaminophen; B-Chemical
APAP) B-Chemical
has O
been O
previously O
reported O
to O
affect O
MDR1 B-Gene
expression O
in O
rat B-Species
liver. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
have O
investigated O
the O
effect O
of O
subtoxic O
doses O
of O
APAP B-Chemical
on O
MDR1 B-Gene
expression O
and O
activity O
in O
rat B-Species
intestine O
and O
human B-Species
intestinal O
cells. O
Administration O
of O
APAP B-Chemical
at O
increasing O
doses O
of O
0.2, O
0.3, O
and O
0.6g O

i.p. O
over O
three O
consecutive O
days, O
induced O
MDR1 B-Gene

rat B-Species
duodenum O
(+240%) O
and O

(+160%) O
as O
detected O

This O

of O
the O
protein O
at O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
villus, O
as O

MDR1 B-Gene

Treatment O
with O
APAP B-Chemical
also O
decreased O

concentrations O
of O
digoxin B-Chemical
found O
in O
anesthetized O
rats B-Species
after O
intraduodenal O
administration O
of O
this O
drug, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
an O
APAP-induced O

Taken O
together O
these O
data O
suggest O
the O
existence O
of O
APAP-induced O
stimulation O
of O
MDR1 B-Gene
transcription O
in O
the O
intestinal O
epithelium. O
These O
findings O
are O
of O
clinical O
relevance, O
as O
co-administration O
of O
APAP B-Chemical
with O
other O
MDR1 B-Gene
substrates O
could O
indirectly O
inhibit O
the O
net O
intestinal O
absorption O
of O
these O
drugs, O
leading O
to O
changes O
in O
their O
pharmacokinetics O
and O
therapeutic O
efficacy. O
