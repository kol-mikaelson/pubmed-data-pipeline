# Abstract
Biotransformation O
of O
cerivastatin, B-Chemical
a O
new O
cholesterol-lowering O
drug, O
by O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
was O
investigated O
using O
the O
14C-labeled O
drug. O
Metabolite O
profiles O
were O
established O
by O
HPLC O
and O
structures O
of O
metabolites O
were O
elucidated. O
Two O
metabolic O
pathways O
were O
equally O
important, O
demethylation O
of O
the O
benzylic O
methyl O
other O
and O
hydroxylation O
at O
one O
methyl O
group O
of O
the O
6-isopropyl O
substituent. O
The O
product O
of O
combined O
hydroxylation O
and O
demethylation O
was O
observed O
as O
a O
minor O
metabolite. O
During O
sample O
preparation O
the O
lactone B-Chemical
forms O
of O
both O
primary O
metabolites O
were O
isolated O
in O
small O
amounts. O
Detailed O
structural O
analysis O
by O
NMR O
and O
LC-ESI-MS O
showed O
that O
hydroxylation O
occurred O
with O
high O
regio- O
and O
stereoselectivity. O
The O
proposed O
structures O
were O
confirmed O
by O
chemical O
synthesis O
of O
enantiomerically O
pure O
reference O
compounds. O
Microsomes O
from O
a O
human B-Species
lymphoblastoid O
AHH-1 B-CellLine
cell O
line, O
stably O
expressing O
CYP B-Gene
3A4, I-Gene
catalyzed O
the O
demethylation O
reaction. O
Upon O
incubation O
of O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
with O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
specific O
CYP B-Gene
3A I-Gene
inhibitor O
TAO, B-Chemical
both O
hydroxylation O
and O
demethylation O
were O
considerably O
reduced. O
This O
indicates O
that O
CYP B-Gene
3A I-Gene
enzymes O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
metabolism. O
