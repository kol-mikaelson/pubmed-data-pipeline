# Abstract
Altered O
energy O
metabolism B-Disease
is O
characteristic O
of O
many O
neurodegenerative B-Disease
disorders. I-Disease
Reductions O
in O
the O
key O
mitochondrial O
enzyme O
complex, O
the O
alpha-ketoglutarate O
dehydrogenase O
complex O
(KGDHC), O
occur O
in O
a O
number O
of O
neurodegenerative B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
including O
Alzheimer's B-Disease
Disease I-Disease
(AD). B-Disease
The O
reductions O
in O
KGDHC O
activity O
may O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
decreases O
in O
brain O
metabolism, B-Disease
which O
occur O
in O
these O
disorders. O
KGDHC O
can O
be O
inactivated O
by O
several O
mechanisms, O
including O
the O
actions O
of O
free B-Chemical
radicals I-Chemical
(Reactive B-Chemical
Oxygen I-Chemical
Species, I-Chemical
ROS). B-Chemical
Other O
studies O
have O
associated O
specific O
forms O
of O
one O
of O
the O
genes O
encoding O
KGDHC O
(namely O
the O
DLST B-Gene
gene) O
with O
AD, B-Disease
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease, I-Disease
as O
well O
as O
other O
neurodegenerative B-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
Reductions O
in O
KGDHC O
activity O
can O
be O
plausibly O
linked O
to O
several O
aspects O
of O
brain B-Disease
dysfunction I-Disease
and O
neuropathology O
in O
a O
number O
of O
neurodegenerative B-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
Further O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
assess O
mechanisms O
underlying O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
KGDHC O
to O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
the O
relation O
of O
KGDHC B-Disease

to O
selective O
vulnerability O
in O
neurodegenerative B-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
