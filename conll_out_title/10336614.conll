# Abstract
Alcohols B-Chemical
and O
aldehydes B-Chemical
in O
the O
metabolic O
pathways O
of O
ethanol B-Chemical
and O
serotonin B-Chemical
are O
substrates O
for O
alcohol B-Chemical
dehydrogenases O
(ADH) O
of O
class O
I O
and O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
reversible O
alcohol B-Chemical
oxidation O
aldehyde B-Chemical
reduction, O
these O
enzymes O
catalyse O
aldehyde B-Chemical
oxidation. O
Class-I O
gammagamma O
ADH O
catalyses O
the O
dismutation O
of O
both O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
and O
5-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde B-Chemical
(5-HIAL) B-Chemical
into O
their O
corresponding O
alcohols B-Chemical
and O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
The O
turnover O
of O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
dismutation O
is O
high O
(kcat O

at O
high O
concentrations O
(Km O

while O
dismutation O
of O
5-HIAL B-Chemical
is O
saturated O
at O
lower O

and O
is O
thereby O
more O

In O
a O

the O
oxidation O
of O
5-hydroxytryptophol B-Chemical

5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
proceeds O
