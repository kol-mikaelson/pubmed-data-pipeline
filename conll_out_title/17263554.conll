# Abstract
The O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
3A4 I-Gene
enzyme O
and O
the O
ABC-transporters O
may O
affect O
the O
first-pass O
extraction O
and O
bioavailability O
of O
drugs O
and O
metabolites. O
Conflicting O
reports O
can O
be O
found O
in O
the O
literature O
on O
the O
expression O
levels O
of O
efflux O
transporters O
in O
human B-Species
intestine O
and O
how O
they O
vary O
along O
the O
intestine. O
The O
relative O
levels O
of O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
of O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
and O
the O
ABC O
tranporters O
Pgp B-Gene
(ABCB1), B-Gene
MRP1 B-Gene
(ABCC1), B-Gene
and O
MRP2 B-Gene
(ABCC2) B-Gene
were O
determined O
using O
RT-PCR O
and O
Western O
blot O
for O
human B-Species
intestinal O
tissues O
(n O

14) O
from O
jejunum, O
ileum O
and O
colon. O
The O
expression O
of O
mRNA O
for O
CYP3A4, B-Gene
Pgp, B-Gene
and O
MRP2 B-Gene
was O
highest O
in O
jejunum O
and O
decreased O
toward O
more O
distal O
regions, O
whereas O
MRP1 B-Gene
was O
equally O
distributed O
in O
all O
intestinal O
regions. O
For O
CYP3A4, B-Gene
a O
more O
significant O
correlation O
could O
be O
established O
between O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
expression O
than O
for O
the O
ABC O
transporters. O
The O
samples O
showed O
considerable O
interindividual O
variability, O
especially O
at O
the O
protein O
level. O
The O
apically O
located O
Pgp B-Gene
and O
MRP2 B-Gene
showed O
a O
similar O
expression O
pattern O
along O
the O
human B-Species

as O
for O
CYP3A4. B-Gene
The O
gene O

MRP1 B-Gene
exhibited O
a O
more O
uniform O
distribution. O
