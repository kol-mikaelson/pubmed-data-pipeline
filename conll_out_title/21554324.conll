# Abstract
Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
N-acetyl B-Chemical
methionine B-Chemical
(NAM) B-Chemical
supplementation O
has O
long O
been O
reported O
as O
a O
bioavailable O
source O
of O
methionine B-Chemical
in O
humans, B-Species
and O
known O
to O
reduce O
liver B-Disease
toxicity I-Disease
after O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
overdose, I-Chemical
its O
cellular O
endogenous O
presence O
has O
never O
been O
investigated. O
We O
demonstrate O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
NAM B-Chemical
is O
present O
in O
both O
human B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
tissues O
and O
cells O
in O
culture. O

N-acetylated B-Chemical

Aminoacylase B-Gene

for O
metabolism O
of O
NAM B-Chemical
to O
methionine B-Chemical

Deficiencies B-Disease
in I-Disease
aminoacylase B-Gene
1 I-Gene
have O
been O
linked O
to O
a O
variety O

disorders; I-Disease
however, O
it O
is O
unclear O
whether O
and O
how O
the O
brain O
is O
affected O
by O
this O
defect. O
The O
reported O
presence O
of O
NAM B-Chemical
in O
the O
human B-Species
brain O
may O
provide O
an O
invaluable O
key O
to O
discovering O
the O

between O
aminoacylase B-Gene
1 I-Gene
mutations O
and O
neurological B-Disease
problems. I-Disease
