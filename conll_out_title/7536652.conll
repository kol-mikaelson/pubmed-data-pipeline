# Abstract
To O
characterize O
the O
metabolic O
pathway O
of O
FK506 B-Chemical
(tacrolimus), B-Chemical
FK506 B-Chemical
or O
its O
31-O-desmethyl O
metabolite O
was O
incubated O
with O
liver O
microsomes O
prepared O
from O
dexamethasone-treated O
rats B-Species
in O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
NADPH-generating O
system O
under O
aerobic O
conditions. O
Besides O
the O
four O
oxidized O
metabolites O
already O
reported, O
four O
new O
metabolites O
were O
isolated O
and O
identified O
by O
HPLC, O
mass O
spectrometry, O
and O
NMR O
spectroscopy, O
and O
their O
biological O
activities O
were O
examined. O
The O
di-demethylated O
metabolites O
at O
the O
15- O
and O
31-, O
13- O
and O
31-, O
and O
13- O
and O
15-methoxy O
groups O
of O
FK506, B-Chemical
were O
designated O
respectively O
as O
M-V, O
M-VI, O
and O
M-VII. O
The O
fourth, O
M-VIII, O
was O
the O
metabolite O
produced O
after O
O-demethylation O
at O
the O
31-methoxy O
group O
and O
formation O

the O
19- O
to O
22-carbon O
of O
the O
macrolide B-Chemical
ring O
after O
oxidation O
of O
the O
19-methyl O
group, O
and O
of O
the O
36- O
and O
37-vinyl O
group O
of O
FK506. B-Chemical
The O
immunosuppressive O
activity O
of O
the O
isolated O
metabolites O
was O
estimated O
in O
a O
mouse B-Species
mixed O
lymphocyte O
reaction O
system O
and O
the O
IC50 O
values O
for O
M-V, O
M-VI, O
M-VII, O
M-VIII, O
and O
FK506 B-Chemical
were O

respectively. O
Reactivity O
of O
the O
metabolites O
with O
mouse B-Species
anti-FK506 O
monoclonal O
antibody O
was O
studied O
and O
immunocrossreactivity O
of O
M-V O
was O
92.3% O
of O
FK506, B-Chemical
but O
no O
reactivity O
was O
observed O
for O
M-VI, O
M-VII, O
and O
M-VIII. O
FK506 B-Chemical
thus O
was O
metabolized O
at O
multiple O
sites O
by O
rat O
hepatic O
microsomes O
and O
the O
metabolites O
formed O
(M-V) O
- O
(M-VIII) O
exhibited O
weak O
