# Abstract
The O
multidrug O
resistance O
protein O
(MRP) O
family O
consists O
of O
several O
members O
and, O
for O
some O
of O
these O
transporter O
proteins, O
distinct O
roles O
in O
multidrug O
resistance O
and O
normal O
tissue O
functions O
have O
been O
well O
established O
(MRP1 B-Gene
and O
MRP2) B-Gene
or O
are O
still O
under O
investigation O
(MRP3). B-Gene
MRP3 B-Gene
expression O
studies O
in O
human B-Species
tissues O
have O
been O
largely O
restricted O
to O
the O
mRNA O
level. O
In O
this O
report O
we O
extended O
these O
studies O
and O
further O
explored O
MRP3 B-Gene
expression O
at O
the O
protein O
level. O
Western O
blot O
and O
immunohistochemistry O
with O
two O
MRP3-specific O
monoclonal O
antibodies, O
M(3)II-9 O
and O
M(3)II-21, O
showed O
MRP3 B-Gene
protein O
to O
be O
present O
in O
adrenal O
gland, O
and O
kidney O
and O
in O
tissues O
of O
the O
intestinal O
tract: O
colon, O
pancreas, O
gallbladder, O
and O
liver. O
In O
epithelia, O
MRP3 B-Gene
was O
found O
to O
be O
located O
at O
the O
basolateral O
sides O
of O
cell O
membranes. O
In O
normal O
liver, O
MRP3 B-Gene
was O
detected O
at O
lower O
levels O
than O
anticipated O
from O
the O
mRNA O
data O
and O
was O
found O
present O
mainly O
in O
the O
bile O
ducts. O
In O
livers O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
various O
forms O
of O
cholestasis, B-Disease
MRP3 B-Gene
levels O
were O
frequently O
increased O
in O
the O
proliferative O
cholangiocytes, O
with O
sometimes O
additional O
staining O
of O
the O
basolateral O
membranes O
of O
the O
hepatocytes. O
This O
was O
especially O
evident O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
type O
3 O
progressive O
familial B-Disease
intrahepatic I-Disease
cholestasis. I-Disease
The O
present O
results O
support O
the O
view O
that O
MRP3 B-Gene
plays O
a O
role O
in O
the O
cholehepatic O
and O
enterohepatic O
circulation O
of O
bile O
and O
in O
protection O
within O
the O
biliary O
tree O
and O
tissues O
along O
the O
bile O
circulation O
route O
against O
toxic O
bile O
constituents. O
The O
possible O
functional O
roles O
for O
MRP3 B-Gene
in O
the O
adrenal O
gland O
and O
in O
the O
kidney O
remain O
as O
yet O
unknown. O
In O
a O
panel O
of O
34 O
tumor B-Disease
samples O
of O
various O
histogenetic O
origins, O
distinct O
amounts O
of O
MRP3 B-Gene
were O
detected O
in O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
cases, O
including O
lung, B-Disease
ovarian, I-Disease
and I-Disease
pancreatic I-Disease
cancers. I-Disease
These O
findings O
may O
be O
of O
potential O
clinical O
relevance O
when O
considering O
the O
drug O
treatment O
regimens O
for O
these O
tumor B-Disease
types. O
