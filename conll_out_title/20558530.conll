# Abstract
In O
humans, B-Species
peroxisomes O
harbor O
a O
complex O
set O
of O
enzymes O
acting O
on O
various O
lipophilic O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
organized O
in O
two O
basic O
pathways, O
alpha-oxidation O
and O
beta-oxidation; O
the O
latter O
pathway O
can O
also O
handle O
omega-oxidized O
compounds. O
Some O
oxidation O
products O
are O
crucial O
to O
human B-Species
health O
(primary O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
polyunsaturated B-Chemical
FAs), I-Chemical
whereas O
other O
substrates O
have O
to O
be O
degraded O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
neuropathology O
at O
a O
later O
age O
(very O
long-chain B-Chemical
FAs I-Chemical
and O
xenobiotic O
phytanic O
acid O
and O
pristanic O
acid). O
Whereas O
total O
absence O
of O
peroxisomes O
is O
lethal, O
single O
peroxisomal O
protein O
deficiencies O
can O
present O
with O
a O
mild O
or O
severe O
phenotype O
and O
are O
more O
informative O
to O
understand O
the O
pathogenic O
factors. O
The O
currently O
known O
single O
protein O
deficiencies O
equal O
about O
one-fourth O
of O
the O
number O
of O
proteins O
involved O
in O
peroxisomal O
FA O
metabolism. O
The O
biochemical O
properties O
of O
these O
proteins O
are O
highlighted, O
followed O
by O
an O
overview O
of O
the O
known O
diseases. O
