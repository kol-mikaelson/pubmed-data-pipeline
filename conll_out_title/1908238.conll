# Abstract
Prolyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase I-Gene
(EC O
3.4.11.5) O
has O
been O
assumed O
to O
be O
a O
unique O
enzyme O
catalyzing O
specifically O
the O
removal O
of O
unsubstituted O
NH2-terminal O
L-prolyl B-Chemical
residues O
from O
various O
peptides O
and O
to O
be O
distinct O
from O
leucyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase I-Gene
(EC O
3.4.11.1). O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
prolyl O
aminopeptidases O
were O
purified O
to O
apparent O
homogeneity O
from O
pig B-Species
small O
intestine O
mucosa O
and O
human B-Species
liver O
and O
their O
NH2-terminal O
amino O
acid O
sequences O
were O
determined O
together O
with O
that O
of O
pig B-Species

leucyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase. I-Gene
The O
NH2-terminal O
24-residue O
sequence O
of O
pig B-Species
intestinal O
prolyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase I-Gene
was O
shown O
to O
be O
identical O
with O
that O
of O
pig B-Species
kidney O
leucyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase. I-Gene
The O
NH2-terminal O
sequence O
of O
human B-Species
liver O
prolyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase I-Gene
was O
also O
shown O
to O
be O
very O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
pig B-Species
kidney O
leucyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase. I-Gene
Further, O
pig B-Species
intestinal O
prolyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase I-Gene
and O
pig B-Species
kidney O
leucyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase I-Gene
were O
immunologically O
indistinguishable. O
These O
lines O
of O
evidence O
strongly O
suggest O
that O
prolyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase I-Gene
is O
identical O
with O
leucyl B-Gene
aminopeptidase. I-Gene
