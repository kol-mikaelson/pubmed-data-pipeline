# Abstract
The O
beneficial O
influence O
of O
three O
common O
spices O
was O
examined O
in O
experimental O
rats B-Species
on: O
(i) O
the O
membrane O
fluidity O
of O
intestinal O
brush-border O
membranes O
(BBM), O
(ii) O
the O
activity O
of O
intestinal O
membrane-bound O
enzymes, O
and O
(iii) O
ultrastructural O
alterations O
in O
the O
intestinal O
epithelium. O
Groups O
of O
male O
Wistar O
rats B-Species
were O
maintained O
on O
dietary O
black O
pepper O
(0.5 O
%), O
red B-Species
pepper I-Species
(3.0 O
%), O
ginger B-Species
(0.05 O
%) O
and O
spice O
bioactive O
compounds O
piperine B-Chemical
(0.02 O
%) O
and O
capsaicin B-Chemical
(0.01 O
%) O
for O
8 O
weeks. O
A O
membrane O
fluidity O
study O
using O
an O
apolar O
fluorescent O
probe O
showed O
increased O
BBM O
fluidity O
in O
all O
the O
spice-fed O
animals. O
This O
was O
corroborated O
by O
a O
decreased O
cholesterol:phospholipid O
ratio O
in O
the O
jejunal O
and O
ileal O
regions O
of O
the O
intestine. O
These O
dietary O
spices O
stimulated O
the O
activities O
of O
BBM O
enzymes O
(glycyl-glycine O
dipeptidase, O
leucine O
amino O
peptidase O
and O
gamma-glutamyl B-Gene
transpeptidase) I-Gene
in O
the O
jejunal O
mucosa, O
suggesting O
a O
modulation O
in O
membrane O
dynamics O
due O
to O
the O
apolar O
spice O
bioactive O
compounds O
interacting O
with O
surrounding O
lipids B-Chemical
and O
hydrophobic O
portions O
in O
the O
protein O
vicinity, O
which O
may O
decrease O
the O
tendency O
of O
membrane O
lipids B-Chemical
to O
act O
as O
steric O
constraints O
to O
enzyme O
proteins O
and O
thus O
modify O
enzyme O
conformation. O
Scanning O
electronic O
microscopy O
of O
the O
intestinal O
villi O
in O
these O
spice O
treatments O
revealed O
alterations O
in O
the O
ultrastructure, O
especially O
an O
increase O
in O
microvilli O
length O
and O
perimeter O
which O
would O
mean O
a O
beneficial O
increase O
in O
the O
absorptive O
surface O
of O
the O
small O
intestine, O
providing O
for O
an O
increased O
bioavailability O
of O
micronutrients. O
Thus, O
dietary O
spices O
(black O
pepper, O
red B-Species
pepper I-Species
and O
ginger) B-Species
were O
evidenced O
to O
induce O
alterations O
in O
BBM O
fluidity O
and O
passive O
permeability O
property, O
associated O
with O
the O
induction O
of O
an O
increased O
microvilli O
length O
and O
perimeter, O
resulting O
in O
an O
increased O
absorptive O
surface O
of O
the O
small O
intestine. O
