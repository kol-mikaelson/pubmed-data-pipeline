# Abstract
In O
an O
effort O
to O
localize O
small O
intestinal O
sterol B-Chemical
synthesis O
both O
along O
the O
length O
of O
the O
intestine O
and O
along O
the O
villus-crypt O
axis, O
we O
defined O
the O
optimal O
conditions O
to O
measure O
absolute O
rates O
of O
digitonin-precipitable O
sterol B-Chemical
(DPS) B-Chemical
synthesis O
in O
whole O
intestinal O
slices O
and O
in O
isolated O
epithelial O
cells. O
When O
[1-(14)C]acetate B-Chemical
and O
[1-(14)C]octanoate B-Chemical
were O
compared O
in O
midgut O
slices, O
[1-(14)C]octanoate B-Chemical
was O
preferentially O
metabolized O
to O
CO(2) B-Chemical
and O
DPS. B-Chemical
Because O
of O
its O
rapid O
intramitochondrial O
degradation, O
[1-(14)C]octanoate B-Chemical
effectively O
swamped-out O
other O
sources O
of O
acetyl B-Chemical
CoA I-Chemical
(C(2)) B-Chemical
and O
achieved O
rates O
of O
C(2) B-Chemical
flux O
into O
DPS B-Chemical
virtually O
identical O
to O
the O
absolute O
rates O
determined O
with O
[(3)H]water. B-Chemical
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
unlabeled O
acetate B-Chemical
decreased O
the O
apparent O
C(2) B-Chemical
flux O
from O
[1-(14)C]octanoate B-Chemical
into O
DPS, B-Chemical
but O
not O
into O
CO(2), B-Chemical
in O
a O
dose-dependent O
fashion O
up O
to O
8 O
mM. O
Under O
comparable O
incubation O
conditions, O
intestinal O
epithelial O
cells O
isolated O
by O
the O
EDTA B-Chemical
chelation O
technique O
differed O
from O
slices O
in O
several O
respects. O
First, O
DPS B-Chemical
synthesis O
from O
the O
various O
substrates O
was O
proportional O
to O
time O
only O
for O
30 O
min O
compared O
to O
90 O
min O
in O
slices. O
Second, O
the O
preferred O
(14)C-labeled O
substrate O
for O
DPS B-Chemical
and O
CO(2) B-Chemical
synthesis O
was O
acetate B-Chemical
rather O
than O
octanoate. B-Chemical
Third, O
neither O
of O
the O
(14)C-labeled O
substrates O
achieved O
the O
rates O
of O
synthesis O
found O
with O
[(3)H]water. B-Chemical
Fourth, O
sterol B-Chemical
synthesis O
from O
any O
of O
the O
substrates O
was O
essentially O
zero O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
in O
the O
incubation O
medium. O
When O
the O
optimal O
rates O
of O
sterol B-Chemical
synthesis O
in O
vitro O
were O
estimated O
using O
[(3)H]water B-Chemical
in O
villus O
and O
crypt O
cell O
fractions O
of O
the O
jejunum O
and O
ileum, O
all O
ileal O
fractions O
were O
more O
active. O
However, O
ileal O
villus O
cells O
exceeded O
the O
jejunal O
villus O
cells O
by O
5.2-fold O
in O
their O
capacity O
to O
incorporate O
[(3)H]water B-Chemical
into O
DPS, B-Chemical
whereas O
the O
crypt O
cell O
fractions O
differed O
by O
only O
1.4-fold. O
The O
majority O
of O
the O
sterol B-Chemical
synthetic O
capacity O
resided O
in O
the O
lower O
villus O
region O
in O
both O
the O
proximal O
and O
distal O
intestine O
and O
the O
crypts O
accounted O
for O
about O
30% O
and O
14%, O
respectively, O
of O
the O
total O
found O
in O
the O
jejunum O
and O
ileum. O
A O
similar O
distribution O
pattern O
along O
both O
the O
vertical O
and O
horizontal O
axes O
of O
the O
intestine O
was O
found O
after O
[(3)H]water B-Chemical
administration O
in O
vivo, O
although O
under O
these O
conditions O
the O
proportion O
recovered O
in O
the O
crypts O
increased O
to O
38% O
and O
31%, O
respectively, O
of O
the O
total O
[(3)H]DPS B-Chemical
found O
in O
the O
jejunum O
and O
ileum. O
These O
studies O
demonstrate O
that O
[(3)H]water B-Chemical
yields O
optimal O
rates O
of O
sterol B-Chemical
synthesis O
both O
in O
intestinal O
slices O
and O
in O
isolated O
epithelial O

and O
is O
incorporated O
into O
DPS B-Chemical

in O

of O
