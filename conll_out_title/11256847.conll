# Abstract
Rosuvastatin B-Chemical
(formerly O
ZD4522) B-Chemical
is O
a O
new O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl B-Gene
coenzyme I-Gene
A I-Gene
(HMG-CoA) B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitor O
(statin) O
with O
distinct O
pharmacologic O
properties. O
Compared O
with O
most O
other O
statins, O
it O
is O
relatively O
hydrophilic, O
similar O
in O
this O
respect O
to O
pravastatin. B-Chemical
Rosuvastatin B-Chemical
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
a O
comparatively O
potent O
inhibitor O
of O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
activity O
in O
a O
purified O
preparation O
of O
the O
catalytic O
domain O
of O
the O
human B-Species
enzyme, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
hepatic O
microsomes. O
In O
rat B-Species
hepatocytes, O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
was O
found O
to O
have O
significantly O
higher O
potency O
as O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
synthesis O
than O
5 O
other O
statins. O
Rosuvastatin B-Chemical
was O
approximately O
1,000-fold O
more O
potent O
in O
rat B-Species
hepatocytes O
than O
in O
rat B-Species
fibroblasts. O
Further O
studies O
in O
rat B-Species
hepatocytes O
demonstrated O
that O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
is O
taken O
up O
into O
these O
cells O
by O
a O
high-affinity O
active O
uptake O
process. O
Rosuvastatin B-Chemical
was O
also O
taken O
up O
selectively O
into O
the O
liver O
after O
intravenous O
administration O
in O
rats. B-Species
Potent O
and O
prolonged O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitory O
activity O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
after O
oral O
administration O
to O
rats B-Species
and O
dogs. B-Species
Pharmacokinetic O
studies O
in O
humans B-Species
using O
oral O
doses O
of O
5 O
to O
80 O
mg O
showed O
that O
maximum O
plasma O
concentrations O
and O
areas O
under O
the O
concentration-time O
curve O
are O
approximately O
linear O
with O
dose. O
The O
terminal O
half-life O
is O
approximately O
20 O
hours. O
Studies O
with O
human B-Species
hepatic O
microsomes O
and O
human B-Species
hepatocytes O
have O
suggested O
little O
or O
no O
metabolism O
via O
the O
cytochrome B-Gene
P-450 I-Gene
3A4 I-Gene
isoenzyme. O
On O
the O
basis O
of O
these O
observations, O
it O
is O
suggested O
that O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
has O
the O
potential O
to O
exert O
a O
profound O
effect O
on O
atherogenic B-Disease
lipoproteins. O
