# Abstract
The O
sialyl-Tn O
(sTn) O
antigen O
is O
a O
well O
known O
cancer-associated O
antigen, O
the O
expression O
of O
which O
is O
related O
to O
the O
prognosis O
of O
cancer B-Disease
patients. B-Species
We O
aimed O
to O
isolate O
a O
human B-Species
gene O
encoding O
an O
N O
-acetylgalactosamine O
alpha2,6-sialyltransferase O
which O
synthesizes O
sTn O
antigen, O
and O
to O
characterize O
the O
enzyme. O
Degenerate O
primers O
encoding O
sialyl O
motifs O
were O
used O
for O
the O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
to O
amplify O
complementary O
DNAs O
prepared O
from O
RNAs O
of O
human B-Species
pyloric O
mucosae O
with O
intestinal B-Disease
metaplasia, I-Disease
which O
abundantly O
expressed O
sTn O
antigen, O
followed O
by O
screening O
of O
full-length O
cDNAs O
using O
the O
amplified O
DNA O
fragment O
as O
a O
probe. O
We O
isolated O
two O
human B-Species
cDNA O
clones, O
long-form O
(2.46 O
kb) O
and O
short-form O
(2.23 O
kb) O
cDNAs. O
The O
former O
encodes O
an O
active O
enzyme O
with O
a O
predicted O
600 O
amino O
acid O
sequence. O
The O
latter, O
a O
splice-variant O
of O
the O
long-form, O
encodes O
an O
inactive O
enzyme. O
HCT15 B-CellLine

stably O
expressing O
the O
long-form O
cDNA O
expressed O

epitopes O
on O
O B-Chemical

The O
long O
form O
cDNA O
was O
considered O
to O
encode O
a O
human B-Species
homologue O
of O
chick B-Species
ST6GalNAc B-Gene
I I-Gene
for O
the O
following O
reasons: O
(1) O
the O
putative O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
showed O
greater O
homology O
to O
that O
of O
chick B-Species
ST6GalNAc B-Gene
I I-Gene
(55%) O
compared O
to O
other O
sialyltransferases, O
(2) O
it O
encodes O
the O
extraordinarily O
long O
stem O
region O
that O
is O
a O
typical O
feature O
of O
chick B-Species
ST6GalNAc B-Gene
I, I-Gene
and O
(3) O
the O
substrate O
specificity O
was O
very O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
chick B-Species
ST6GalNAc B-Gene
I. I-Gene
In O
situ O
hybridization O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
localization O
of O
transcripts O
correlated O
well O
with O
that O
of O
sTn O
antigen O
in O
gastric B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
cells O
and O
Goblet B-CellLine
cells O
in O
intestinal O
metaplastic B-Disease
glands. O
Thus, O
we O
determined O
that O
the O
long-form O
cDNA O
of O
the O
human B-Species
ST6GalNAc B-Gene
I I-Gene
gene O
encodes O
the O
probable O
candidate O
for O
the O
human B-Species
sTn O
