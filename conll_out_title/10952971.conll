# Abstract
Subcellular O

cyclic O
nucleotide O
phosphodiesterases O
(PDEs) O

important O

compartmentalization O

responses. O
In O
3T3-L1 B-CellLine
adipocytes, O
mouse B-Species
(M) O
PDE3B B-Gene
was O
associated O
with O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
(ER) O
as O

immunofluorescent O

In O

COS-7 B-CellLine

recombinant O
wild-type O
PDE3A B-Gene
and O
PDE3B B-Gene
isoforms O
were O
both O
found O
almost O
exclusively O
in O
the O
ER. O
The O
N-terminal O
portion O
of O
PDE3 O
can O
be O
arbitrarily O
divided O
into O
region O
1 O
(aa O
1-300), O
which O
contains O
a O
large O
hydrophobic O
domain O
with O
six O
predicted O
transmembrane O
helices, O
followed O
by O
region O
2 O
(aa O
301-500) O
containing O
a O
smaller O
hydrophobic O
domain O
(of O
approximately O
50 O
aa). O
To O
investigate O
the O
role O
of O
regions O
1 O
and O
2 O
in O
membrane O
association, O
we O
examined O
the O
subcellular O
localization O
of O
a O
series O
of O
catalytically O
active, O
Flag-tagged O
N-terminal-truncated O
human B-Species
(H) O

and O
MPDE3B O
recombinants, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
series O
of O

and O
2 O
of O
MPDE3B O
synthesized O

in O
COS-7 B-CellLine

In O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells, O
the O
localization O
of O
a O
mutant O
HPDE3A, O
lacking O
the O
first O
189 O
amino O
acids O
(aa) O
and O
therefore O
four O
of O
the O
six O
predicted O
transmembrane O
helices O
(H3A-Delta189), O
was O
virtually O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
wild O
type. O
M3B-Delta302 O
(lacking O
region O
1) O
and O
H3A-Delta397 O
(lacking O
region O
1 O
as O
well O
as O
part O
of O
region O
2) O
retained, O
to O
different O
degrees, O
the O
ability O
to O
associate O
with O
membranes, O
albeit O
less O
efficiently O
than O
H3A-Delta189. O
Proteins O
that O
lacked O
both O
regions O
1 O
and O
2, O
H3A-Delta510 O
and O
M3B-Delta604, O
did O
not O
associate O
with O
membranes. O
Consistent O
with O
these O
findings, O
region O
1 O
EGFP-MPDE3B O
fusion O
proteins O
colocalized O
with O
the O
ER, O
whereas O
region O
2 O
EGFP O
fusion O
proteins O
were O
diffusely O
distributed. O
Thus, O
some O
portion O
of O
the O
N-terminal O
hydrophobic O
domain O
in O
region O
1 O
plus O
a O
second O
domain O
in O
region O
2 O
are O
important O
for O
efficient O
membrane O
association O
targeting O
of O
PDE3. O
