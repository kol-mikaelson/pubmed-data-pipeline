# Abstract
In O
animals, O
dihydroorotate B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(DHODH) B-Gene
is O
a O
mitochondrial O
protein O
that O
carries O
out O
the O
fourth O
step O
in O
de O
novo O
pyrimidine B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
Because O
this O
is O
the O
only O
enzyme O
of O
this O
pathway O
that O
is O
localized O
to O
mitochondria O
and O
because O
the O
enzyme O
is O
cytosolic O
in O
some O
bacteria O
and O
fungi, O
we O
carried O
out O
studies O
to O
understand O
the O
mode O
of O
targeting O
of O
animal O
DHODH B-Gene
and O
its O
submitochondrial O
localization. O
Analysis O
of O
fractionated O
rat B-Species
liver O
mitochondria O
revealed O
that O
DHODH B-Gene
is O
an O
integral O
membrane O
protein O
exposed O
to O
the O
intermembrane O
space. O
In O
vitro-synthesized O
Drosophila, B-Species
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
DHODH B-Gene
proteins O
were O
efficiently O
imported O
into O
the O
intermembrane O
space O
of O
isolated O
yeast B-Species
mitochondria. O
Import O
did O
not O
alter O
the O
size O
of O
the O
in O
vitro O
synthesized O
protein, O
nor O
was O
there O
a O
detectable O
size O
difference O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
DHODH B-Gene
protein O
found O
in O
vivo. O
Thus, O
there O
is O
no O
apparent O
proteolytic O
processing O
of O
the O
protein O
during O
import O
either O
in O
vitro O
or O
in O
vivo. O
Import O
of O
rat B-Species
DHODH B-Gene
into O
isolated O
yeast B-Species
mitochondria O
required O
inner O
membrane O
potential O
and O
was O
at O
least O
partially O
dependent O
upon O
matrix O
ATP, B-Chemical
indicating O
that O
its O
localization O
uses O
the O
well O
described O
import O
machinery O
of O
the O
mitochondrial O
inner O
membrane. O
The O
DHODH B-Gene
proteins O
of O
animals O
differ O
from O
the O
cytosolic O
proteins O
found O
in O
some O
bacteria O
and O
fungi O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
an O
N-terminal O
segment O
that O
resembles O
mitochondrial-targeting O
presequences. O
Deletion O
of O
the O
cationic O
portion O
of O
this O
N-terminal O
sequence O
from O
the O
rat B-Species
DHODH B-Gene
protein O
blocked O
its O
import O
into O
isolated O
yeast B-Species
mitochondria, O
whereas O
deletion O
of O
the O
adjacent O
hydrophobic O
segment O
resulted O
in O
import O
of O
the O
protein O
into O
the O
matrix. O
Thus, O
the O
N-terminus O
of O
the O
DHODH B-Gene
protein O
contains O
a O
bipartite O
signal O
that O
governs O
import O
and O
correct O
insertion O
into O
the O
mitochondrial O
inner O
membrane. O
