# Abstract
Mammalian O
sperm O
motility, O
capacitation, O
and O
the O
acrosome O
reaction O
are O
regulated O
by O
signal O
transduction O
systems O
involving O
cAMP B-Chemical
as O
a O
second O
messenger. O
Levels O
of O
cAMP B-Chemical
are O
controlled O
by O
two O
key O
enzymes, O
adenylyl O
cyclase O
and O
phosphodiesterases O
(PDEs), O
the O
latter O
being O
involved O
in O
cAMP B-Chemical
degradation. O
Calmodulin-dependent O
PDE B-Gene
(PDE1) O
and O
cAMP-specific O
PDE B-Gene

activities O
were O
previously O
identified O
in O
spermatozoa O
via O
the O

Here O
we O
report O
that O
human B-Species

PDEs O
are O
associated O
with O
the O
plasma O

(50%-60%) O
as O
well O
as O
with O
the O
particulate O
fraction O
(30%-50%) O
and O
have O
more O
affinity O
for O
cAMP B-Chemical
than O
cGMP. B-Chemical
Immunocytochemical O
data O
indicated O
that O
PDE1A, B-Gene

localized O

the O
equatorial O
segment O

the O
sperm O

as O
well O
as O
on O
the O
mid O

principal O

the O

that O
PDE3A B-Gene

found O
on O
the O
postacrosomal O

the O
sperm O

Immunoblotting O
confirmed O
the O
presence O

PDE1A B-Gene

PDE3A B-Gene
isoforms O
in O
spermatozoa. O
Milrinone, B-Chemical

Results O
obtained O

indicated O
that O
calmodulin B-Gene

tightly O

PDE1A. B-Gene
Incubation O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O

permanently O
activated O
in O
human B-Species
