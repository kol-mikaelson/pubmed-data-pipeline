disease. O

# Abstract
In O
vertebrates, O
the O
glucuronidation O
of O
small O
lipophilic O
agents O
is O
catalyzed O
by O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases B-Gene
(UGTs). B-Gene
This O
metabolic O
pathway O
leads O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
water-soluble O
metabolites O
originating O
from O
normal O
dietary O
processes, O
cellular O
catabolism, O
or O
exposure O
to O
drugs O
and O
xenobiotics. O
This O
classic O
detoxification O
process, O
which O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
nearly O
50 O
years O
ago O
of O
the O
cosubstrate O
UDP-glucuronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(19), O
is O
now O
known O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
15 O
human B-Species
UGTs. B-Gene
Characterization O
of O
the O
individual O
gene O
products O
using O
cDNA O
expression O
experiments O
has O
led O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
over O
350 O
individual O
compounds O
that O
serve O
as O
substrates O
for O
this O
superfamily O
of O
proteins. O
This O
data, O
coupled O
with O
the O
introduction O
of O
sophisticated O
RNA O
detection O
techniques O
designed O
to O
elucidate O
patterns O
of O
gene O
expression O
of O
the O
UGT O
superfamily O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
and O
extrahepatic O
tissues O
of O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract, O
has O
aided O
in O
understanding O
the O
contribution O
of O
glucuronidation O
toward O
epithelial O
first-pass O
metabolism. O
In O
addition, O
characterization O
of O
the O
UGT1A B-Gene
locus O
and O
genetic O
studies O
directed O
at O
understanding O
the O
role O
of O
bilirubin B-Chemical
glucuronidation O
and O
the O
biochemical O
basis O
of O
the O
clinical O
symptoms O
found O
in O
unconjugated B-Disease
hyperbilirubinemia I-Disease
have O
uncovered O
the O
structural O

polymorphisms O
associated O
with O
Crigler-Najjar's B-Disease
and I-Disease
Gilbert's I-Disease
syndrome. I-Disease
The O
role O
of O
the O
UGTs B-Gene
in O
metabolism O
and O
different O
disease O
states O
in O
humans O
is O
the O
