# Abstract
Using O
the O
sequences O
of O
a O
galactose O
6-O-sulfotransferase O
and O
an O
N-acetylglucosamine O
6-O-sulfotransferase O
as O
probes O
in O
an O
EST O
approach, O
we O
have O
identified O
a O
highly O
related O
cDNA O
in O
human B-Species
and O
an O
apparent O
orthologue O
in O
mouse. B-Species
The O
cDNAs O
predict O
type O
II O
transmembrane O
proteins O
that O
constitute O
new O
members O
of O
the O
Gal O
GalNAc O
GlcNAc O
6-O-sulfotransferase O
(GST) O
family. O
Members O
of O
this O
family O
have O
previously O
been O
implicated O
in O
the O
sulfation O
of O
GAG B-Chemical
chains O
within O
proteoglycans O
and O
the O
sulfation O
of O
O-linked O
chains O
within O
sialomucin O
ligands O
for O
l-selectin. B-Gene
Expression O
of O
the O
newly O
identified O
cDNA O
in O
COS B-CellLine
cells O
led O
to O
the O
addition O
of O
sulfate O
to O
C-6 O
of O
GlcNAc O
in O
an O
acceptor O
glycoprotein. O
The O
tissue O
expression O
of O
transcripts O
corresponding O
to O
the O
cDNA O
was O
highly O
restricted O
to O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
colon O
in O
humans. O
Based O
on O
these O
characteristics, O
the O
novel O
sulfotransferase O
is O
designated O
I-GlcNAc6ST O
for O
intestinal O
GlcNAc O
6-O-sulfotransferase. O
