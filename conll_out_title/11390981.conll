# Abstract
The O
tumor B-Disease
suppressors O
EXT1 B-Gene
and O
EXT2 B-Gene
are O
associated O
with O
hereditary O
multiple O
exostoses O
and O
encode O
bifunctional O
glycosyltransferases O
essential O
for O
chain O
polymerization O
of O
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
(HS) B-Chemical
and O
its O
analog, O
heparin B-Chemical
(Hep). B-Chemical
Three O
highly O
homologous O
EXT-like O
genes, O
EXTL1-EXTL3, O
have O
been O
cloned, O
and O
EXTL2 B-Gene
is O
an O
alpha1,4-GlcNAc O
transferase O
I, O
the O
key O
enzyme O
that O
initiates O
the O
HS B-Chemical
Hep B-Chemical
synthesis. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
truncated O
forms O
of O
EXTL1 B-Gene
and O
EXTL3, B-Gene
lacking O
the O
putative O
NH2-terminal O
transmembrane O
and O
cytoplasmic O
domains, O
were O
transiently O
expressed O
in O
COS-1 B-CellLine
cells O
and O
found O
to O
harbor O
alpha-GlcNAc O
transferase O
activity. O
EXTL3 B-Gene
used O
not O
only O
N-acetylheparosan B-Chemical
oligosaccharides I-Chemical
that O
represent O
growing O
HS B-Chemical
chains O
but O
also O
GlcAbeta1-3Galbeta1-O-C2H4NH-benzyloxycarbonyl B-Chemical
(Cbz), B-Chemical
a O
synthetic O
substrate O
for O
alpha-GlcNAc O
transferase O
I O
that O
determines O
and O
initiates O
HS B-Chemical
Hep B-Chemical
synthesis. O
In O
contrast, O
EXTL1 B-Gene
used O
only O
the O
former O
acceptor. O
Neither O
EXTL1 B-Gene
nor O
EXTL3 B-Gene
showed O
any O
glucuronyltransferase O
activity O
as O
examined O
with O
N-acetylheparosan B-Chemical
oligosaccharides. I-Chemical
Heparitinase O
I O
digestion O
of O
each O
transferase-reaction O
product O
showed O
that O
GlcNAc B-Chemical
had O
been O
transferred O
exclusively O
through O
an O
alpha1,4-configuration. O
Hence, O
EXTL3 B-Gene
most O
likely O
is O
involved O
in O
both O
chain O
initiation O
and O
elongation, O
whereas O
EXTL1 B-Gene
possibly O
is O
involved O
only O
in O
the O
chain O
elongation O
of O
HS B-Chemical
and, O
maybe, O
Hep B-Chemical
as O
well. O
Thus, O
their O
acceptor O
specificities O
of O
the O
five O
family O
members O
are O
overlapping O
but O
distinct O
from O
each O
other, O
except O
for O
EXT1 B-Gene
and O
EXT2 B-Gene
with O
the O
same O
specificity. O
It O
now O
has O
been O
clarified O
that O
all O
of O
the O
five O
cloned O
human B-Species
EXT B-Gene
gene O
family O
proteins O
harbor O
glycosyltransferase O
activities, O
which O
probably O
contribute O
to O
the O
synthesis O
of O
HS B-Chemical
and O
Hep. B-Chemical
