# Abstract
To O
gain O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
the O
metabolic O
properties O
between O
the O
open O
acid O
and O
lactone B-Chemical
form O
of O
HMG-CoA O
reductase O
inhibitors O
(statins), O
the O
paper O
focused O
primarily O
on O
characterizing O
the O
metabolic O
properties O
of O
statins. O
We O
compared O
the O
metabolism O
of O
the O
acid O
and O
lactone B-Chemical
forms O
of O
several O
statins, O
including O
atrovastatin, B-Chemical
simvastatin, B-Chemical
cerivastatin B-Chemical
fluvastatin, B-Chemical
pitavastatin B-Chemical
and O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
with O
respect O
to O
metabolic O
clearance, O
CYP O
enzymes O
involved O
and O
drug-drug O
interactions. O
A O
remarkable O
increase O
in O
metabolic O
clearance O
was O
noted O
for O
all O
lactones B-Chemical
compared O
with O
all O
acids O
except O
for O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
lactone. I-Chemical
The O
metabolic O
clearances O
of O
the O
atrovastatin, B-Chemical
simvastatin, B-Chemical
cerivastatin, B-Chemical
fluvastatin B-Chemical
and O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
lactones B-Chemical
were O
73-, O
70-, O
30-, O
7- O
and O
64-fold O
higher, O
respectively, O
than O
those O
of O
the O
corresponding O
acids. O
CYP2Cs O
were O
critically O
involved O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
cerivastatin, B-Chemical
fluvastatin B-Chemical
and O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
In O
contrast, O
CYP2Cs O
were O
not O
involved O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
the O
corresponding O
lactones B-Chemical
and O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
was O
mainly O
involved. O
Moreover, O
a O
substantial O
difference O
in O
the O
metabolic O
inhibition O
of O
statins O
was O
found O
between O
acids O
and O
lactones. B-Chemical
Overall, O
the O
study O
demonstrates O
that O
CYP-mediated O
metabolism O
of O
lactones B-Chemical
is O
also O
a O
common O
metabolic O
pathway O
for O
statins O
and O
that O
the O
CYP3A4-mediated O
metabolism O
of O
the O
lactone B-Chemical
forms O
clearly O
will O
need O
to O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
in O
assessing O
mechanistic O
aspects O
of O
drug-drug O
interaction O
involving O
statins. O
