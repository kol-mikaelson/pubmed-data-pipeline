# Abstract
Folate B-Chemical
catabolism O
has O
been O
assumed O
to O
result O
from O
the O
nonenzymatic O
oxidative O
degradation O
of O
labile O
folate B-Chemical
cofactors. O
Increased O
rates O
of O
folate B-Chemical
catabolism O
and O
simultaneous O
folate B-Chemical
deficiency I-Disease
occur O
in O
several O
physiological O
states, O
including O
pregnancy, O
cancer, B-Disease
and O
when O
anticonvulsant O
drugs O
are O
used. O
These O
studies O
have O
introduced O
the O
possibility O
that O
folate B-Chemical
catabolism O
may O
be O
a O
regulated O
cellular O
process O
that O
influences O
intracellular O
folate B-Chemical
concentrations. O
Recent O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
iron O
storage O
protein O
ferritin O
can O
catabolize O
folate B-Chemical
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo, O
and O
increased O
heavy-chain O
ferritin O
synthesis O
decreases O
intracellular O
folate B-Chemical
concentrations O
independent O
of O
exogenous O
folate B-Chemical
levels O
in O
cell O
culture O
models. O
Ferritin O
levels O
are O
elevated O
in O
most O
physiological O
states O
associated O
with O
increased O
folate B-Chemical
catabolism. O
Therefore, O
folate B-Chemical
catabolism O
is O
emerging O
as O
an O
important O
component O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
intracellular O
folate B-Chemical
concentrations O
and O
whole-body O
folate B-Chemical
status. O
