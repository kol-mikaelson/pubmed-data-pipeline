# Abstract
beta,beta-Carotene B-Gene
15,15'-dioxygenase I-Gene
cleaves O
beta-carotene B-Chemical
into O
two O
molecules O
of O
retinal B-Chemical
and O
is O
therefore O
the O
key O
enzyme O
in O
beta-carotene B-Chemical
metabolism O
to O
vitamin B-Chemical
A. I-Chemical
In O
the O
present O
study, O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
enrich O
the O
chicken B-Species
beta,beta-carotene B-Gene
15,15'-dioxygenase I-Gene
to O
such O
an O
extent O
that O
partial O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
information O
could O
be O
obtained O
to O
design O
degenerate O
oligonucleotides. O
With O
RT-PCR O
a O
cDNA O
fragment O
could O
be O
obtained O
and O
used O
subsequently O
in O
a O
radioactive O
screening O
of O
a O
chicken B-Species
duodenal O
expression O
library. O
We O
cloned O
the O
first O
eukaryotic O
beta,beta-carotene B-Gene
15,15'-dioxygenase I-Gene
which O
symmetrically O
cleaves O
beta-carotene B-Chemical
at O
the O
15,15'-double O
bond. O
