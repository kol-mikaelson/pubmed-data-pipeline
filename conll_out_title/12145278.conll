Molecular O
cloning O
and O
characterization O
of O
a O

transfers O
glucuronic B-Chemical

# Abstract
We O
found O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
gene O
(GenBank O
accession O
number, O
Kazusa O
DNA O
Research O
Institute O
KIAA1402) O
that O
possesses O
homology O
with O
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase. O
The O
full-length O
open O
reading O
frame O
consists O
of O
772 O
amino O
acids O
and O
encodes O
a O
typical O
type O
II O
membrane O
protein. O
This O
enzyme O
had O
a O
domain O
containing O
beta O
3-glycosyltransferase O
motifs, O
which O
might O
be O
a O
beta3-glucuronyltransferase O
domain, O
but O
no O
domain O
with O
beta O
4-glycosyltransferase O
motifs, O
although O
both O
are O
found O
in O
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase. O
The O
putative O
catalytic O
domain O
was O
expressed O
in O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells O
as O
a O
soluble O
enzyme. O
Its O
glucuronyltransferase O
activity O
was O
observed O
when O
chondroitin B-Chemical
and O
chondroitin B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
polysaccharides I-Chemical
and O
oligosaccharides B-Chemical
were O
used O
as O
acceptor O
substrates. O
However, O
it O
was O
not O
detected O
when O
dermatan B-Chemical
sulfate, I-Chemical
hyaluronan, B-Chemical
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate, I-Chemical
heparin, B-Chemical
N-acetylheparosan, B-Chemical
lactosamine B-Chemical
tetrasaccharide, I-Chemical
and O
linkage O
tri- O
and O
tetrasaccharide O
acceptors O
were O
employed. O
The O
reaction O
product, O
which O
was O
speculated O
to O
exhibit O
a O
GlcA B-Chemical
beta I-Chemical
1-3GalNAc I-Chemical
linkage O
structure O
at O
its O
non-reducing O
terminus, O
showed O
the O
following O
characteristics. O
1) O
It O
was O
catabolized O
by O
beta-glucuronidase. B-Gene
2) O
It O
was O
an O
acceptor O
for O
Escherichia O
coli O
K4 O
chondroitin B-Chemical
polymerase O
(K4 O
chondroitin B-Chemical
polymerase). O
3) O
The O
product O
of O
K4 O
chondroitin B-Chemical
polymerase O
was O
cleaved O
by O
chondroitinase O
ACII. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
no O
N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase O
activity O
was O
detected O
toward O
any O
acceptors. O
Quantitative O
real O
time O
PCR O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
its O
transcripts O
were O
highly O
expressed O
in O
the O
placenta, O
small O
intestine, O
and O
pancreas, O
although O
they O
were O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
in O
various O
tissues O
and O
cell O
lines. O
This O
enzyme O
could O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
synthesis O
of O
chondroitin B-Chemical
sulfate O
as O
a O
glucuronyltransferase. O
