# Abstract
Sphingosine-1-phosphate B-Chemical
(S1P) B-Chemical
is O
a O
pleiotropic O
lipid B-Chemical
mediator O
that O
regulates O
cell O
survival, O
migration, O
the O
recruitment O
of O
immune O
cells, O
angiogenesis, O
and O
lymphangiogenesis, O
all O
of O
which O
are O
involved O
in O
cancer B-Disease
progression. O
S1P B-Chemical
is O
generated O
inside O
cancer B-Disease
cells O
by O
sphingosine O
kinases O
then O
exported O
outside O
of O
the O
cell O
into O
the O
tumor B-Disease
microenvironment O
where O
it O
binds O
to O
any O
of O
five O
G O
protein O
coupled O
receptors O
and O
proceeds O
to O
regulate O
a O
variety O
of O
functions. O
We O
have O
recently O
reported O
on O
the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
the O
"inside-out" O
signaling O
of O
S1P, B-Chemical
its O
export O
through O
the O
plasma O
membrane, O
and O
its O
interaction O
with O
cell O
surface O
receptors. O
Membrane O
lipids, B-Chemical
including O
S1P, B-Chemical
do O
not O
spontaneously O
exchange O
through O
lipid B-Chemical
bilayers O
since O
the O
polar O
head O
groups O
do O
not O
readily O
go O
through O
the O
hydrophobic O
interior O
of O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
Instead, O
specific O
transporter O
proteins O
exist O
on O
the O
membrane O
to O
exchange O
these O
lipids. B-Chemical
This O
review O
summarizes O
what O
is O
known O
regarding O
S1P B-Chemical
transport O
through O
the O
cell O
membrane O
via O
ATP-binding O
cassette O
transporters O
and O
the O
spinster O
2 O
transporter O
and O
discusses O
the O
roles O
for O
these O
transporters O
in O
cancer B-Disease
and O
in O
the O
tumor B-Disease
microenvironment. O
Based O
on O
our O
research O
and O
the O
emerging O
understanding O
of O
the O
role O
of O
S1P B-Chemical
signaling O
in O
cancer B-Disease
and O
in O
the O
tumor B-Disease
microenvironment, O
S1P B-Chemical
transporters O
and O
S1P B-Chemical
signaling O
hold O
promise O
as O
new O
therapeutic O
targets O
for O
cancer B-Disease
drug O
development. O
