# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Glutaric B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
type I-Disease
1 I-Disease
(GA1) B-Disease
is O
an O
inborn B-Disease
error I-Disease
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
the O
amino O
acids O
tryptophan, B-Chemical
lysine B-Chemical
and O
hydroxylysine B-Chemical
due O
to O
mutations O
in O
the O
GCDH B-Gene
gene O
coding O
for O
glutaryl-CoA B-Gene
dehydrogenase. I-Gene
Affected O
individuals O
often O
suffer O
from O
an O
encephalopathic B-Disease
crisis O
in O
infancy O
or O
childhood O
which O
results O
in O
acute O
striatal B-Disease
injury I-Disease
leading O
to O
a O
severe O
dystonic-dyskinetic B-Disease
movement I-Disease
disorder. I-Disease
Isobutyryl-coenzyme O
dehydrogenase O
(IBD) O
is O
an O
enzyme O
encoded O
by O
the O
ACAD8 B-Gene
gene O
and O
involved O
in O
the O
catabolism O
of O
the O
branched-chain B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
valine. B-Chemical
Both O
GA1 B-Disease
and O
IBD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
can O
be O
detected O
by O
expanded O
newborn O
screening O
using O
tandem-mass O
spectrometry, O
if O
they O
are O
considered O
screening O
targets. O
METHODS: O
Tandem-mass O
spectrometry O
and O
gas-chromatography O
with O
mass-selective O
detection O
were O
used O
for O
the O
assessment O
of O
key O
metabolites O
in O
body O
fluids O
of O
a O
patient B-Species
with O
abnormal O
findings O
in O
newborn O
screening. O
Mutations O
were O
investigated O
by O
direct O
sequencing O
and O
by O
restriction O
fragment O
lengths O
analysis. O
Valine B-Chemical
metabolism O
was O
studied O
in O

in O
immortalized O
lymphocytes. O
RESULTS: O
Following O
accumulation O
of O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
C5DC B-Chemical
and O
C4, B-Chemical
of O
3-hydroxyglutaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical

the O
GCDH B-Gene

p.Arg161Gln, B-ProteinMutation
which O
had O
been O
reported O
in O
GA1 B-Disease
before. O
In O
the O
ACAD8 B-Gene
gene O
a O
novel O
mutation O
c.841+3G>C B-DNAMutation
was O
identified, O
which O

corroborated O
by O
the O

CONCLUSION: O
The O
molecular O
basis O
of O
two O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
of I-Disease
metabolism I-Disease
in O
a O
newborn O
was O
elucidated. O
The O

underline O
the O
