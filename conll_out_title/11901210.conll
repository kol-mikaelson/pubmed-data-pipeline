# Abstract
The O
L-type B-Gene
amino I-Gene
acid I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
1 I-Gene
(LAT1) B-Gene
is O
an O
Na(+)-independent O
neutral O
amino O
acid O
transporter O
subserving O
the O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
L. O
Because O
of O
its O
broad O
substrate O
selectivity, O
system O
L O
has O
been O
proposed O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
permeation O
of O
amino O
acid-related O
drugs O
through O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
To O
understand O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
substrate O
recognition, O
we O
have O
examined O
the O
LAT1-mediated O
transport O
using O
a O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocyte O
expression O
system. O
LAT1-mediated O
[(14)C]phenylalanine B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
strongly O
inhibited O
in O
a O
competitive O
manner O
by O
aromatic-amino B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
derivatives O
including O
L-dopa, B-Chemical
alpha-methyldopa, B-Chemical
melphalan, B-Chemical
triiodothyronine, B-Chemical
and O
thyroxine, B-Chemical
whereas O
phenylalanine B-Chemical
methyl I-Chemical
ester, I-Chemical
N-methyl B-Chemical
phenylalanine, I-Chemical
dopamine, B-Chemical
tyramine, B-Chemical
carbidopa, B-Chemical
and O
droxidopa B-Chemical
did O
not O
inhibit O
[(14)C]phenylalanine B-Chemical
uptake. O
Gabapentin, B-Chemical
a O
gamma-amino B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
also O
exerted O
a O
competitive O
inhibition O
on O
LAT1-mediated O
[(14)C]phenylalanine B-Chemical
uptake. O
Although O
most O
of O
the O
compounds O
that O
inhibited O
LAT1-mediated O
uptake O
were O
able O
to O
induce O
the O
efflux O
of O
[(14)C]phenylalanine B-Chemical
preloaded O
to O
the O
oocytes O
expressing O
LAT1 B-Gene
through O
the O
obligatory O
exchange O
mechanism, O
melphalan, B-Chemical
triiodothyronine, B-Chemical
and O
thyroxine B-Chemical
did O
not O
induce O
the O
significant O
efflux. O
Based O
on O
the O
experimental O
and O
semiempirical O
computational O
analyses, O
it O
is O
proposed O
that, O
for O
an O
aromatic O
amino O
acid O
to O
be O
a O
LAT1 B-Gene
substrate, O
it O
must O
have O
a O
free O
carboxyl O
and O
an O
amino O
group. O
The O
carbonyl O
oxygen B-Chemical
closer O
to O
the O
amino O
group O
needs O
a O
computed O
charge O
of O
-0.55 O
approximately O
-0.56 O
and O
must O
not O
participate O
in O
hydrogen B-Chemical
bonding. O
In O
addition, O
the O
hydrophobic O
interaction O
between O
the O
substrate O
side O
chain O
and O
the O
substrate O
binding O
site O
of O
LAT1 B-Gene
seems O
to O
be O
crucial O
for O
the O
substrate O
binding. O
A O
substrate, O
however, O
becomes O
a O
blocker O
once O
Connolly O
accessible O
areas O
become O
large O
and O
or O
the O
molecule O
has O
a O
high O
calculated O
logP O
value, O
such O
as O
those O
for O
melphalan, B-Chemical
triiodothyronine, B-Chemical
and O
thyroxine. B-Chemical
