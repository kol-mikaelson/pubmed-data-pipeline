# Abstract
12-Lipoxygenase O
and O
cyclooxygenase B-Gene
1 I-Gene
are O
the O
dominating O
enzymes O
that O
metabolize O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
platelets. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
conversion O
of O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
12-lipoxygenase O
can O
also O
utilize O
5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
form O
5(S), B-Chemical
12(S)-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
14(R), B-Chemical
15(S)-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic I-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
respectively. O
Furthermore, O
15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
works O
as O
an O
inhibitor O
for O
12-lipoxygenase. O
In O
the O
present O

we O
have O
studied O
the O

albumin B-Gene
on O

The O
presence O
of O
albumin B-Gene
reduced O
the O

In O
contrast, O
when O
15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic B-Chemical

platelets, O
the O
formation O
of O

albumin. B-Gene
Furthermore, O
albumin B-Gene
