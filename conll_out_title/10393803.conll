# Abstract
Using O
antibodies O
against O
autophagic O
vacuole O
membrane O
proteins O
we O
identified O
a O
human B-Species
cDNA O
with O
an O
open O
reading O
frame O
of O
1848 O
bp, O
encoding O
a O
protein O
of O
70 O
kDa, O
which O
we O
named O
lysosomal B-Gene
apyrase-like I-Gene
protein I-Gene
of I-Gene
70 I-Gene
kDa I-Gene
(LALP70). B-Gene
Sequence O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
LALP70 B-Gene
belongs O
to O
the O
apyrase O
or O
GDA1 O
CD39 B-Gene
family O
and O
is O
almost O
identical O
to O
a O
human B-Species
uridine B-Gene
diphosphatase, I-Gene
with O
the O
exception O
of O
nine O
extra O
amino O
acids O
in O
LALP70. B-Gene
Members O
of O
this O
family O
were O
originally O
described O
as O
ectoenzymes, O
with O
some O
intracellular O
exceptions. O
Transfected O
LALP70 B-Gene
fused O
to O
the O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
localized O
in O
the O
cytoplasm O
with O
a O
punctate O
pattern O
in O
the O
perinuclear O
space. O
These O
structures O
colocalized O
with O
the O
autophagic O
marker O
monodansylcadaverine B-Chemical
and O
the O
lysosomal O
protein O
lamp1. B-Gene
Hydrophobicity O
analysis O
of O
the O
encoded O
protein O
revealed O
a O
transmembrane O
region O
at O
the O
N O
and O
C O
termini. O
Most O
of O
the O
sequence O
is O
arranged O
between O
these O
transmembrane O
domains, O
and O
contains O
four O
apyrase O
conserved O
regions. O
In O
vitro O
transcription O
translation O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
microsomes O
showed O
that O
no O
signal O
sequence O
is O
cleaved O
off O
and O
that O
the O
translation O
product O
is O
protected O
from O
trypsin O
treatment. O
Our O
data O
indicate O
that O
LALP70 B-Gene
is O
a O
type O
III O
lysosomal O
autophagic O
vacuole O
membrane O
protein O
with O
the O
apyrase O
conserved O
regions O
facing O
the O
luminal O
space O
of O
the O
vacuoles. O
