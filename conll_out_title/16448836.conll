# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Tyrosinemia B-Disease
type I-Disease
I I-Disease
(TYR O
1) O
is O
a O
severe O
disorder O
causing O
early B-Disease
death I-Disease
if O
left O
untreated. O
While O
tyrosine B-Chemical
can O
be O
determined O
in O
dried O
blood O
spots O
(DBS), O
it O
is O
not O
a O
specific O
marker O
for O
TYR O
1 O
and O
most O
often O
associated O
with O
benign O
transient O
tyrosinemia B-Disease
of O
the O
newborn. O
Succinylacetone B-Chemical
(SUAC) B-Chemical
is O
a O
specific O
marker O
for O
TYR O
1 O
but O
not O
detectable O
by O
routine O
newborn O
screening. O
We O
developed O
a O
new O
assay O
that O
determines O
SUAC B-Chemical
in O
DBS O
by O
liquid-chromatography O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
(LC-MS O
MS). O
METHODS: O
Whole O
blood O
is O
eluted O
from O
a O
3 O
16-in. O
DBS O
by O
an O
aqueous O
solution O
containing O
deuterium B-Chemical
labeled O
SUAC B-Chemical
as O
internal O
standard O
(IS). O
SUAC B-Chemical
and O
IS O
are O
oximated, O
then O
extracted, O
butylated, O
and O
analyzed O
by O
LC-MS O
MS. O
Quantitation O
is O
from O
SUAC B-Chemical
spiked O
calibrator O
DBS O
over O
the O
range O
0-200 O
microM O
using O
selected O
reaction O
monitoring O
of O
transitions O
m O
z O
212 O
to O
156 O
and O
m O
z O
214 O
to O
140 O
for O
SUAC B-Chemical
and O
IS, O
respectively. O
Analysis O
time O
is O
5 O
min. O
To O
assess O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
a O
two-tier O
screening O
approach O
for O
TYR O
1 O
we O
applied O
this O
assay O
to O
our O
newborn O
screening O
program O
over O
the O
last O
15 O
months. O
RESULTS: O
The O
intra-assay O
precision O
was O
determined O
for O
three O
different O
levels O
of O
SUAC B-Chemical
(5, O
20, O
and O
50 O
micromol O
L) O
and O
the O
CV O
calculated O
to O
be O
4.7, O
2.6, O
and O
3.1%, O
respectively O
(n=5). O
Inter-assay O
precision O
CVs O
were O
12.7, O
8.2, O
and O
7.8%, O
respectively O
on O
the O
same O
samples. O
SUAC B-Chemical
levels O

cases O
not O
treated O
with O
2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione B-Chemical
(NTBC) B-Chemical
were O
clearly O
abnormal O
(16-150 O
micromol O
L; O
mean: O
61 O
micromol O
L; O
controls: O
<5 O

Over O
a O
15-month O
period, O
SUAC B-Chemical
was O
determined O
in O
newborn O
screening O
samples O
with O
elevated O
tyrosine B-Chemical
concentrations O
when O
applying O
different O
cut O
off O
values O
until O
it O
was O
settled O
at O

No O
case O
of O
TYR O

was O
detected O
in O
124,780 O
newborns O
tested. O
CONCLUSION: O
We O
have O
developed O
a O
new O
LC-MS O
MS O
based O
method O
for O
the O
determination O
of O
SUAC B-Chemical
in O
DBS. O
This O
assay O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
significantly O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
false O
positive O
results O
in O
newborn O
screening O
for O
TYR O
1 O
and O
can O
also O
be O
used O
for O
