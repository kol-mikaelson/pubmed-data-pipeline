# Abstract
During O
the O
last O
2 O
years, O
several O
novel O
genes O
that O
encode O
glucose O
transporter-like O
proteins O
have O
been O
identified O
and O
characterized. O
Because O
of O
their O
sequence O
similarity O
with O
GLUT1, B-Gene
these O
genes O
appear O
to O
belong O
to O
the O
family O
of O
solute O
carriers O
2A O
(SLC2A, O
protein O
symbol O
GLUT). B-Gene
Sequence O
comparisons O
of O
all O
13 O
family O
members O
allow O
the O
definition O
of O
characteristic O
sugar B-Chemical
polyol O
transporter O
signatures: O
(1) O
the O
presence O
of O
12 O
membrane-spanning O
helices, O
(2) O
seven O
conserved O
glycine O
residues O
in O
the O
helices, O
(3) O
several O
basic O
and O
acidic O
residues O
at O
the O
intracellular O
surface O
of O
the O
proteins, O
(4) O
two O
conserved O
tryptophan O
residues, O
and O
(5) O
two O
conserved O
tyrosine O
residues. O
On O
the O
basis O
of O
sequence O
similarities O
and O
characteristic O
elements, O
the O
extended O
GLUT B-Gene
family O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
three O
subfamilies, O
namely O
class O
I O
(the O
previously O
known O
glucose O
transporters O
GLUT1-4), B-Gene
class O
II O
(the O
previously O
known O
fructose O
transporter O
GLUT5, B-Gene
the O
GLUT7, B-Gene
GLUT9 B-Gene
and O
GLUT11), B-Gene
and O
class O
III O
(GLUT6, B-Gene
8, I-Gene
10, I-Gene
12, I-Gene
and O
the O
myo-inositol O
transporter O
HMIT1). O
Functional O
characteristics O
have O
been O
reported O
for O
some O
of O
the O
novel O
GLUTs. O
Like O
GLUT1-4, B-Gene
they O
exhibit O
a O
tissue O
cell-specific O
expression O
(GLUT6, B-Gene
leukocytes, O
brain; O
GLUT8, B-Gene
testis, O
blastocysts, O
brain, O
muscle, O
adipocytes; O
GLUT9, B-Gene
liver, O
kidney; O
GLUT10, B-Gene
liver, O
pancreas; O
GLUT11, B-Gene
heart, O
skeletal O
muscle). O
GLUT6 B-Gene
and O
GLUT8 B-Gene
appear O
to O
be O
regulated O
by O
sub-cellular O
redistribution, O
because O
they O
are O
targeted O
to O
intra-cellular O
compartments O
by O
dileucine O
motifs O
in O
a O
dynamin O
dependent O
manner. O
Sugar B-Chemical
transport O
has O
been O
reported O
for O
GLUT6, B-Gene
8, I-Gene
and I-Gene
11; I-Gene
HMIT1 O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
a O
H+ B-Gene
myo-inositol I-Gene
co-transporter. I-Gene
Thus, O
the O
members O
of O
the O
extended O
GLUT B-Gene
family O
exhibit O
a O
surprisingly O
diverse O
substrate O
specificity, O
and O
the O
definition O
of O
sequence O
elements O
determining O
this O
substrate O
specificity O
will O
require O
a O
full O
functional O
characterization O
of O
all O
members. O
