# Abstract
The O
acid O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
is O
usually O
found O
as O
a O
soluble O
component O
of O
lysosomes O
where O
fucoglycoconjugates O
are O
degraded. O
In O
the O
present O
investigation, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
cell O
surface O
protein O
with O
enzymatic O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
activity O
that O
crossreacts O
specifically O
with O
a O
rabbit O
anti-(alpha-L-fucosidase) O
Ig. O
By O
different O
approaches, O
this O
alpha-L-fucosidase, O
which O
represents O
10-20% O
of O
the O
total O
cellular O
fucosidase O
activity, O
was O
detected O
in O
all O
the O
tested O
human O
cells O
(hemopoietic, O
epithelial, O
mesenchymal). O
Two O
bands O
of O
approximately O
43-49 O
kDa O
were O
observed, O
although O
theoretical O
data O
support O
the O
possibility O
of O
having O
the O
same O
genetic O
origin O
that O
the O
known O
50 O
to O
55-kDa O
Mr O
alpha-L-fucosidase. O
We O
speculate O
about O
an O
alternative O
traffic O
pathway O
for O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
alpha-L-fucosidase O
to O
work O
on O
the O
rapid O
turnover O
of O
glycoproteins. O
