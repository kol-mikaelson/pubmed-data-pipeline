# Abstract
Nucleoside B-Chemical
analogs O
are O
important O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
hematologic B-Disease
malignancies, I-Disease
solid B-Disease
tumors, I-Disease
and O
viral B-Disease
infections. I-Disease
Their O
metabolism O
to O
the O
triphosphate B-Chemical
form O
is O
central O
to O
their O
chemotherapeutic O
efficacy. O
Although O
the O
nucleoside B-Chemical
kinases O
responsible O
for O
the O
phosphorylation O
of O
these O
compounds O
have O
been O
well O
described, O
the O
nucleotidases O
that O
may O
mediate O
drug O
resistance O
through O
dephosphorylation O
remain O
obscure. O
We O
have O
cloned O
and O
characterized O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
cytosolic O
5'-nucleotidase O
(cN-I) O
that O
potentially O
may O
have O
an O
important O
role O
in O
nucleoside B-Chemical
analog I-Chemical
metabolism. O
It O
is O
expressed O
at O
a O
high O
level O
in O
skeletal O
and O
heart O
muscle, O
at O
an O
intermediate O
level O
in O
pancreas O
and O
brain, O
and O
at O
a O
low O
level O
in O
kidney, O
testis, O
and O
uterus. O
The O
recombinant O
cN-I O
showed O
high O
affinity O
toward O
dCMP B-Chemical
and O
lower O
affinity O
toward O
AMP B-Chemical
and O
IMP. B-Chemical
ADP B-Chemical
was O
necessary O
for O
maximal O
catalytic O
activity. O
Expression O
of O
cN-I O
in O
Jurkat B-CellLine
and O
HEK B-CellLine
293 I-CellLine
cells O
conferred O
resistance O
to O
2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine, B-Chemical
with O
a O
49-fold O
increase O
in O
the O
IC(50) O
in O
HEK B-CellLine
293 I-CellLine
and O
a O
greater O
than O
400-fold O
increase O
in O
the O
IC(50) O
in O
Jurkat B-CellLine
cells. O
Expression O
of O
cN-I O
also O
conferred O
a O
22-fold O
increase O
in O
the O
IC(50) O
to O
2',3'-difluorodeoxycytidine B-Chemical
in O
HEK B-CellLine
293 I-CellLine
cells O
and O
an O
82-fold O
increase O
in O
the O
IC(50) O
to O
2',3'-dideoxycytidine B-Chemical
in O
Jurkat B-CellLine
cells. O
These O
data O
indicate O
that O
cN-I O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
physiological O
pyrimidine B-Chemical
nucleotide I-Chemical
pools O
and O
may O
also O
alter O
the O
therapeutic O
efficacy O
of O
certain O
nucleoside B-Chemical
analogs. O
