# Abstract
Isolated O
biotin-resistant B-Disease
3-methylcrotonyl-CoA I-Disease
carboxylase I-Disease
(MCC) I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
an O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
of O
leucine B-Chemical
catabolism O
that O
appears O
to O
be O
the O

The O
phenotype O
is O
variable, O
ranging O
from O
neonatal O
onset O
with O
severe O
neurological O
involvement O
to O
asymptomatic O
adults. O
MCC O
is O
a O
heteromeric O
mitochondrial O
enzyme O
composed O
of O
biotin-containing O
alpha O
subunits O
and O
smaller O
beta O
subunits. O
Here, O
we O
report O
cloning O
of O
MCCA B-Gene
and O
MCCB B-Gene
cDNAs O
and O
the O

of O
their O

genes. O
We O
show O
that O
a O

groups, O
CG1 O
and O

MCCB B-Gene
and O
MCCA, B-Gene

We O
identify O
five O
