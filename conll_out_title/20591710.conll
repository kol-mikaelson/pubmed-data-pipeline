# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Flow-injection O
MS O
MS O
methods O
for O
elevated O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
are O
routinely O
performed O
in O
most O
newborn O
screening O
and O
biochemical O
genetics O
laboratories; O
however O
this O
technique O
cannot O
distinguish O
between O
isobaric O
compounds; O
therefore, O
chromatographic O
separation O
is O
required O
to O
quantitate O
isomers O

METHODS: O
A O
UPLC-MS O
MS O
method O
has O
been O
developed O
for O
the O
simultaneous O
quantitation O
of O
isobutyrylcarnitine B-Chemical
and O
butyrylcarnitine, B-Chemical
and O
a O
second O
UPLC-MS O
MS O
method O
for O
the O
quantitation O
of O
isovalerylcarnitine, B-Chemical
(S) B-Chemical
and O
(R) B-Chemical
2-methylbutyrylcarnitine, B-Chemical
pivaloylcarnitine B-Chemical
and O
valerylcarnitine. B-Chemical
Plasma O

are O
extracted O
with O

are O
used O
for O
quantitation. O
Separation O
is O
obtained O
using O
a O

are O
detected O
with O
a O
Quattro O

RESULTS: O
Intra-day O
precision O

ranged O
from O
1.4% O
to O
14% O
and O
accuracy O
from O
88% O

114% O
respectively O
for O

isobutyrylcarnitine. B-Chemical
Precision O

the O
isomers O

C5-acylcarnitine B-Chemical
ranged O
from O
1.3% O
to O
15% O
and O
accuracy O
87% O
to O
119%, O
respectively O
in O
plasma O

dried O
blood O

Inter-day O
precision O
was O
within O
20% O
at O
each O
concentration O
of O
isobutyrylcarnitine B-Chemical
and O
butyrylcarnitine. B-Chemical
Precision O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Two O

based O
on O
the O
separation O

The O
separation O
of O
C5-acylcarnitines O
can O
reveal O
false O
elevation O
due O
to O
pivalic O

antibiotics. O
Abnormal O

due O
to O
pivalate-generating O
prodrug O
antibiotics O
of O
maternal O
origin O
were O
confirmed. O
This O
separation O
of O
isomers O
can O
resolve O
multiple O
diagnostic O
challenges O
in O
both O
newborn O

in O
cases O
