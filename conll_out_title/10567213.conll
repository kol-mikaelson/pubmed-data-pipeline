# Abstract
The O
human B-Species
homologue O
of O
the O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
YSA1 B-Gene
protein, O
YSA1H, B-Gene
has O
been O
expressed O
as O
a O
thioredoxin O
fusion O
protein O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli. I-Species
It O
is O
an O
ADP-sugar O
pyrophosphatase O
with O
similar O
activities O
towards O
ADP-ribose B-Chemical
and O
ADP-mannose. B-Chemical
Its O
activities O
with O
ADP-glucose B-Chemical
and O
diadenosine B-Chemical
diphosphate I-Chemical
were O
56% O
and O
20% O
of O
that O
with O
ADP-ribose B-Chemical
respectively, O
whereas O
its O
activity O
towards O
other O
nucleoside B-Chemical
5'-diphosphosugars I-Chemical
was O
typically O
2-10%. O
cADP-ribose B-Chemical
was O
not O
a O
substrate. O
The O
products O
of O
ADP-ribose B-Chemical
hydrolysis O
were O
AMP B-Chemical
and O
ribose B-Chemical
5-phosphate. I-Chemical
K(m) O
and O
k(cat) O
values O
with O
ADP-ribose B-Chemical
were O
60 O
microM O
and O
5.5 O
s(-1) O
respectively. O
The O
optimal O
activity O
was O
at O
alkaline O
pH O
(7.4-9.0) O
with O
2.5-5 O
mM O
Mg(2+) B-Chemical
or O
100-250 O
microM O
Mn(2+) B-Chemical
ions; O
fluoride B-Chemical
was O
inhibitory, O
with O
an O
IC(50) O
of O
20 O
microM. O
The O
YSA1H B-Gene
gene, O
which O
maps O
to O
10p13-p14, O
is O
widely O
expressed O
in O
all O
human B-Species
tissues O
examined, O
giving O
a O
1.4 O
kb O
transcript. O
The O
41.6 O
kDa O
fusion O
protein O
behaved O
as O
an O

on O
gel O
filtration. O
After O
cleavage O
with O
enterokinase, O
the O
24.4 O
kDa O
native O
protein O
fragment O
ran O
on O
SDS B-Chemical
PAGE O
with O
an O
apparent O

of O
33 O
kDa. O
Immunoblot O
analysis O
with O
a O
polyclonal O
antibody O
raised O
against O
the O
recombinant O
YSA1H B-Gene
revealed O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
protein O
of O
apparent O
molecular O
mass O
33 O
kDa O
in O
various O
human B-Species
cells, O
including O
erythrocytes. O
The O
sequence O
of O
YSA1H B-Gene
contains O
a O
MutT O
sequence O
signature O
motif. O
A O
major O
proposed O
function O
of O
the O
MutT O
motif O
proteins O
is O
to O
eliminate O
toxic O
nucleotide O
metabolites O
from O
the O
cell. O
Hence O
the O
function O
of O
YSA1H B-Gene
might O
be O
to O
remove O

arising O
from O
NAD(+) B-Chemical
and O
