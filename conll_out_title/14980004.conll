# Abstract
The O
characterization O
of O
the O
transport O
mechanism O
of O
progesterone, B-Chemical
which O
is O
one O

in O
the O

has O
been O
studied O
by O
the O
examination O
of O
progesterone B-Chemical
uptake O
into O
the O
monolayers O
of O
SW-13 B-CellLine
cells O
(a O

line). O
The O
uptake O
of O
[(3)H]progesterone B-Chemical
at O
a O

According O
to O
kinetic O
analysis O
of O
the O
concentration O

the O
uptake O
of O
progesterone B-Chemical
involves O
saturable O
and O
non-saturable O
processes. O

The O

The O

The O
