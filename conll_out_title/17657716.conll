# Abstract
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl B-Gene
coenzyme I-Gene
A I-Gene
(HMG-CoA) B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors O
are O
known O
to O
modulate O
carcinogenesis. B-Disease
In O
this O
study, O
we O
investigated O
whether O
a O
lipophilic O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitor O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
suppresses O
inflammation-related O
mouse B-Species
colon B-Disease
carcinogenesis. I-Disease
Male O
CD-1 O
(ICR) O
mice B-Species
were O
initiated O
with O
a O

for O
7 O
days. O
The O
experimental O
diets O
containing O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
at O
2 O
dose O
levels O
(1 O
and O
10 O
ppm) O
were O
fed O
to O
male O
CD-1 O
(ICR) O
mice B-Species
for O
17 O
weeks, O
staring O
1 O
week O
after O
the O
cessation O
of O
DSS B-Chemical
exposure. O
The O
effects O
of O
dietary O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
on O
colonic B-Disease
tumor I-Disease
development O
were O
assessed O
at O
Weeks O
5, O
10 O
and O
20. O
Feeding O
with O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
at O
both O
doses O
significantly O
inhibited O
the O
multiplicity O
of O
colonic B-Disease
adenocarcinoma I-Disease
at O
Week O
20. O
Furthermore, O
the O
treatment O
significantly O
lowered O
the O
positive O
rates O
of O
proliferating B-Gene
cell I-Gene
nuclear I-Gene
antigen I-Gene
and O
increased O
the O
apoptotic O
index O
in O
the O
colonic B-Disease
epithelial I-Disease
malignancies. I-Disease
The O
treatment O
also O
reduced O
nitrotyrosine-positivity O
in O
the O
colonic O
mucosa. O
Our O
findings O
thus O
show O
that O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
is O
effective O
in O
inhibiting O
colitis-related O
colon B-Disease
carcinogenesis I-Disease
through O
modulation O
of O
mucosal B-Disease
inflammation, I-Disease
oxidative O
nitrosative O
stress, O
and O
cell O
proliferation. O
