# Abstract
The O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
is O
lined O
by O
a O
simple O
epithelium O
that O
undergoes O
constant O
renewal O
involving O
cell O
division, O
differentiation O
and O
cell O
death. O
In O
addition, O
the O
epithelial O
lining O
separates O
the O
hostile O
processes O
of O
digestion O
and O
absorption O
that O
occur O
in O
the O
intestinal O
lumen O
from O
the O
aseptic O
environment O
of O
the O
internal O
milieu O
by O
defensive O
mechanisms O
that O
protect O
the O
epithelium O
from O
being O
breached. O
Central O
to O
these O
defensive O
processes O
is O
the O
synthesis O
of O
heme B-Chemical
and O
its O
catabolism O
by O
heme B-Chemical
oxygenase O
(HO). O
Dietary O
heme B-Chemical
is O
also O
an O
important O
source O
of O
iron B-Chemical
for O
the O
body O
which O
is O
taken O
up O
intact O
by O
the O
enterocyte. O
This O
review O
describes O
the O
recent O
literature O
on O
the O
diverse O
properties O
of O
heme B-Chemical
HO O
in O
the O
intestine O
tract. O
The O
roles O
of O
heme B-Chemical
HO O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
cell O
cycle O
apoptosis, O
detoxification O
of O
xenobiotics, O
oxidative O
stress, O
inflammation, B-Disease
development O
of O

heme-iron O
absorption O
and O

are O
specifically O
examined. O
