# Abstract
S-Adenosyl-L-methionine B-Chemical
(SAMe), B-Chemical
a O
metabolite O
present O
in O
all O
living O
cells, O
plays O
a O
central O
role O
in O
cellular O
biochemistry O
as O
a O
precursor O
to O
methylation, O
aminopropylation, O
and O
transsulfuration O
pathways. O
As O
such, O
SAMe B-Chemical
has O
been O
studied O
extensively O
since O
its O
chemical O
structure O
was O
first O
described O
in O
1952. O
Decades O
of O
research O
on O
the O
biochemical O
and O
molecular O
roles O
of O
SAMe B-Chemical
in O
cellular O
metabolism O
have O
provided O
an O
extensive O
foundation O
for O
its O
use O
in O
clinical O
studies, O
including O
those O
on O
depression, B-Disease
dementia, B-Disease
vacuolar B-Disease
myelopathy, I-Disease
liver B-Disease
disease, I-Disease
and O
osteoarthritis. B-Disease
