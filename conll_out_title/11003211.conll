# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
The O
human B-Species
prenatal O
brain O
is O
very O
sensitive O
to O
the O
toxic O
effects O
of O
ethanol, B-Chemical
but O
very O
little O
information O
is O
available O
concerning O
the O
conversion O
of O
ethanol B-Chemical
to O
the O
highly O
cytotoxic O
metabolite, O
acetaldehyde, B-Chemical
in O
that O
organ. O
Thus, O
experiments O
were O
designed O
to O
investigate O
rates O
of O
accumulation O
of O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
from O
ethanol B-Chemical
in O
the O
prenatal O
human B-Species
brain. O
METHODS: O
Prenatal O
human B-Species

tissue O
homogenates O
were O
used O
as O
enzyme O
sources O
and O
were O
compared O
with O
analogous O
preparations O
of O
adult O

Generated O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
was O
derivatized O
with O
cyclohexane-1,3-dione B-Chemical
to O
yield O
fluorescent O
decahydroacrizine-1,8-dione, B-Chemical
which O
was O
readily O
separated, O
detected, O
and O
quantitated O
with O
HPLC. O
RESULTS: O
Detected O
rates O
of O
accumulation O
were O
unexpectedly O
high, O
even O
in O
the O

of O
added O
NADPH, B-Chemical

are O
cofactors O

reactions, O
respectively. O
Without O

approximately O
20% O

Cofactor O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Experiments O
indicated O
a O
relatively O
rapid O
accumulation O
of O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
from O
ethanol B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
prenatal O
brain O

suggested O
that O
the O
observed O
cofactor O
cosubstrate-independent O
reactions O
were O
largely O
independent O
of O
P-450 O
cytochromes, O

Results O
were O
