# Abstract
Bovine O
serum O
albumin B-Gene
from O
a O
number O
of O
commercial O
sources O
were O
screened O
for O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
peptidase O
contamination. O
Peptidase O
activity O
was O
monitored O
using O
various O
peptides B-Chemical
as O
substrates. O
Two O
commercial O
preparations O
were O
found O
to O
have O
peptidase O
activity, O
and O
the O
enzyme O
was O
identified, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
its O
substrate O
specificity, O
as O
prolidase B-Gene
(EC O
3.4.14.9). O
The O
contaminating O
activity O
was O
in O
the O
order O
of O
3-4 O
units O
g O
albumin. B-Gene
