interactions. O

# Abstract
Alcohol B-Chemical
and O
histamine B-Chemical
metabolic O
pathways O
in O
the O
body O
have O
the O
common O
enzymes O
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
and O
aldehyde B-Gene
oxidase. I-Gene
The O
metabolite O
of O
ethanol, B-Chemical
acetaldehyde, B-Chemical
can O
effectively O
compete O
with O
the O
metabolites O
of O
histamine, B-Chemical
methylimidazole B-Chemical
acetaldehyde, B-Chemical
and O
imidazole B-Chemical
acetaldehyde. B-Chemical
At O
the O
periphery, O
alcohol B-Chemical
and O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
liberate O
histamine B-Chemical
from O
its O
store O
in O
mast O
cells O
and O
depress O
histamine B-Chemical
elimination O
by O
inhibiting O
diamine B-Gene
oxidase, I-Gene
resulting O
in O
elevated O
histamine B-Chemical
levels O
in O
tissues. O
Histamine B-Chemical
mediates O
alcohol-induced O
gastric B-Disease
and I-Disease
intestinal I-Disease
damage I-Disease
and O
bronchial B-Disease
asthma I-Disease
as O
well O
as O
flushing B-Disease
in O
Orientals. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
alcohol B-Chemical
provokes O
food-induced O
histaminosis B-Disease
and O
histamine B-Chemical
intolerance, O
which O
is O
an O
epidemiological O
problem. O
There O
are O
many O
controversial O
reports O
concerning O
the O
effect O
of O
H2 O
receptor O
antagonists O
on O
ethanol B-Chemical
metabolism O
and O
the O
activity O
of O
alcohol B-Chemical
dehydrogenase O
in O
the O
stomach. O
In O
addition, O
alcohol B-Chemical
affects O
histamine B-Chemical
levels O
in O
the O
brain O
by O
modulating O
histamine B-Chemical
synthesis, O
release, O
and O
turnover. O
Histamine B-Chemical
receptor O
antagonists O
can O
affect O
ethanol B-Chemical
metabolism O
and O
change O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
animals O
to O
the O
hypnotic O
effects O
of O
alcohol. B-Chemical
In O
contrast O
to O
other O
neurotransmitters, O
the O
involvement O
of O
the O
brain O
histamine B-Chemical
system O
in O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
central O
actions O
of O
alcohol B-Chemical
and O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
alcoholism B-Disease
is O
poorly O
studied O
and O
understood. O
