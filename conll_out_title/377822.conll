# Abstract
Plasma O
cholesterol B-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
are O
formed O
within O
the O
circulation O
by O
lecithin-cholesterol B-Gene
acyltransferase I-Gene
(LCAT), B-Gene
an O
enzyme O
produced O
by O
the O
liver. O
Patients B-Species
with O
hepatocellular B-Disease
disease I-Disease
have O
low O
plasma O
LCAT B-Gene
activity. O
This O
largely O
accounts O
for O
the O
decreased O
levels O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
observed O
in O
such O
patients B-Species
and O
appears O
due O
to O
impaired O
hepatic O
production O
of O
the O
enzyme. O
In O
contrast, O
activity O
of O
the O
LCAT B-Gene
reaction O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
cholestasis B-Disease
seems O
variable O
and O
is O
the O
subject O
of O
controversy, O
largely O
because O
the O
influence O
of O
abnormal O
cholestatic B-Disease
lipoproteins O
on O
the O
reaction O
requires O
further O
clarification.Human O
liver O
contains O
a O
lysosomal O
cholesterol B-Chemical
ester I-Chemical
hydrolase O
(CEH) B-Gene
which O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
hepatic O
cholesterol B-Chemical
homeostasis. O
In O
patients B-Species
with O
liver B-Disease
damage I-Disease
there O
is O
no O
concrete O
evidence O
of O
circulating O
CEH B-Gene
activity, O
but O
recent O
studies O
show O
elevated O
activity O
of O
hydrolase O
within O
the O
liver O
itself O
in O
acute B-Disease
hepatitis. I-Disease
Hepatic O
activity O
of O
another O
lysosomal O
enzyme, O
acid O
phosphatase, O
is O
not O
increased, O
suggesting O
that O
high O
CEH B-Gene
in O
hepatitic B-Disease
liver I-Disease
does O
not O
simply O
reflect O
a O
general O
increase O
in O
lysosomal O
enzymes. O
The O
pathogenesis O
and O
significance O
of O
altered O
CEH B-Gene
activity O
in O
liver B-Disease
disease I-Disease
require O
further O
study. O
