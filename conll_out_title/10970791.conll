# Abstract
The O
GLUT9 B-Gene
gene O
encodes O
a O
cDNA O
which O
exhibits O
significant O
sequence O
similarity O
with O
members O
of O
the O
glucose B-Chemical
transporter O
(GLUT) O
family. O
The O
gene O
is O
located O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
9q34 I-Chromosome
and O
consists O
of O
10 O
exons O
separated O
by O
short O
introns. O
The O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
deduced O
from O
its O
cDNA O
predicts O
12 O
putative O
membrane-spanning O
helices O
and O
all O
the O
motifs O
(sugar-transporter O
signatures) O
that O
have O
previously O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
transport O
activity. O
A O
striking O
characteristic O
of O
GLUT9 B-Gene
is O
the O
presence O
of O
two O
arginines O
in O
the O
putative O
helices O
7 O
and O
8 O
at O
positions O
where O
the O
organic O
anion O
transporters O
harbour O
basic O
residues. O
The O
next O
relative O
of O
GLUT9 B-Gene
is O

GLUT8 B-Gene
GLUTX1 B-Gene
(44.8% O

A O
2.6-kb O
transcript O
of O
GLUT9 B-Gene
was O
detected O
in O
spleen, O
peripheral O
leucocytes O
and O
brain. O
Transfection O
of O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells O
with O
GLUT9 B-Gene
produced O
expression O
of O
a O
46-kDa O
membrane O
protein O
which O
exhibited O
reconstitutable O
glucose-transport O
activity O
and O
low-affinity O
cytochalasin-B B-Chemical
binding. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
GLUT9 B-Gene
is O
a O
novel O
member O
of O
the O
family O

with O
a O
tissue-specific O
