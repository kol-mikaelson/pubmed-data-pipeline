# Abstract
Urate, B-Chemical
a O
naturally O
occurring O
product O
of O
purine B-Chemical
metabolism, O
is O
a O
scavenger O
of O
biological O
oxidants O
implicated O
in O
numerous O
disease O
processes, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
its O
capacity O
of O
neuroprotection. O
It O
is O
present O
at O
higher O
levels O
in O
human B-Species
blood O
(200 O
500 O
microM) O
than O
in O
other O
mammals, O
because O
humans B-Species
have O
an O
effective O
renal O
urate B-Chemical
reabsorption O
system, O
despite O
their O
evolutionary O
loss O
of O
hepatic O
uricase B-Gene
by O
mutational O
silencing. O
The O
molecular O
basis O
for O
urate B-Chemical
handling O
in O
the O
human B-Species
kidney O
remains O
unclear O
because O
of O
difficulties O
in O
understanding O
diverse O
urate B-Chemical
transport O
systems O
and O
species O
differences. O
Here O
we O
identify O
the O
long-hypothesized O
urate B-Chemical
transporter O
in O
the O
human B-Species
kidney O
(URAT1, B-Gene
encoded O
by O
SLC22A12), B-Gene
a O
urate B-Chemical
anion O
exchanger O
regulating O
blood O
urate B-Chemical
levels O
and O
targeted O
by O
uricosuric B-Chemical
and O
antiuricosuric O
agents O
(which O
affect O
excretion O
of O
uric B-Chemical
acid). I-Chemical
Moreover, O
we O
provide O
evidence O
that O
patients B-Species
with O
idiopathic B-Disease
renal I-Disease
hypouricaemia I-Disease
(lack O
of O
blood O
uric B-Chemical
acid) I-Chemical
have O
defects O
in O
SLC22A12. B-Gene
Identification O
of O
URAT1 B-Gene
should O
provide O
insights O
into O
the O
nature O
of O
urate B-Chemical
homeostasis, O
as O
well O
as O
lead O
to O
the O
development O
of O
better O
agents O
against O
hyperuricaemia, B-Disease
a O
disadvantage O
concomitant O
with O
human B-Species
evolution. O
