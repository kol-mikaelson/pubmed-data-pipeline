# Abstract
A O
putative O
Drosophila B-Species
nucleotide O
sugar O
transporter O
was O
characterized O
and O
shown O
to O
be O
the O
Drosophila B-Species
homologue O
of O
the O
human B-Species
UDP-Gal B-Chemical
transporter O
(hUGT). B-Gene
When O
the O
Drosophila B-Species
melanogaster I-Species
UDP-Gal B-Chemical
transporter O
(DmUGT) B-Gene
was O
expressed O
in O
mammalian O
cells, O
the O
transporter O
protein O
was O
localized O
in O
the O
Golgi O
membranes O
and O
complemented O
the O
UDP-Gal B-Chemical
transport O
deficiency O
of O
Lec8 B-CellLine
cells O
but O
not O
the O
CMP-Sia B-Chemical
transport O
deficiency O
of O
Lec2 B-CellLine
cells. O
DmUGT B-Gene
and O
hUGT B-Gene
were O
expressed O
in O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
cells O
in O
functionally O
active O
forms. O
Using O
microsomal O
vesicles O
isolated O
from O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
expressing O
these O
transporters, O
we O
unexpectedly O
found O
that O
both O
hUGT B-Gene
and O
DmUGT B-Gene
could O
transport O
UDP-GalNAc B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
UDP-Gal. B-Chemical
When O
amino-acid O
residues O
that O
are O
conserved O
among O
human, B-Species

yeast B-Species
and O
Drosophila B-Species
UGTs, B-Gene
but O
are O
distinct O
from O
corresponding O
ones O
conserved O
among O
CMP-Sia B-Chemical
transporters O
(CSTs), B-Gene
were O
substituted O
by O
those O
found O
in O
CST, B-Gene
the O
mutant O
transporters O
were O
still O
active O
in O
transporting O
UDP-Gal. B-Chemical
One O
of O
these O
mutants O
in O
which O
Asn47 B-ProteinMutation
was I-ProteinMutation
substituted I-ProteinMutation
by I-ProteinMutation
Ala I-ProteinMutation
showed O
aberrant O
intracellular O
distribution O
with O
concomitant O
destabilization O
of O
the O
protein O
product. O
However, O
this O
mutation O
was O
suppressed O
by O
an O
Ile51 B-ProteinMutation
to I-ProteinMutation
Thr I-ProteinMutation
second-site O
mutation. O
Both O
residues O
were O
localized O
within O
the O
first O
transmembrane O
helix, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
helix O
contributes O
to O
the O
stabilization O
and O
substrate O
recognition O
of O
the O
UGT O
molecule. O
