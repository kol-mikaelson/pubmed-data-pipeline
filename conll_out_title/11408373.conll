# Abstract
Losartan, B-Chemical
an O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
antagonist, O
is O
oxidized O
by O
hepatic O
cytochromes O
P450 O
to O
an O
active O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolite, O
E-3174. B-Chemical
The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
investigation O
was O
to O
study O
the O
contribution O
of O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
and O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
in O
losartan B-Chemical
oxidation O
in O
vitro O
and O
to O
evaluate O
the O
role O
of O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
polymorphism. O
Kinetic O
properties O
of O
different O
genetic O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
variants O
were O
compared O
both O
in O
a O
yeast B-Species

and O
in O
25 O
different O
samples O
of O
human B-Species

microsomes O
where O
all O
known O
genotypes O
of O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
were O
represented. O
Microsomes O
were O
incubated O
with O
losartan B-Chemical
(0.05-50 O
microM), O
and O
the O
formation O
of O
E-3174 B-Chemical
was O
analyzed O
by O
high-performance O

V(max), O

and O
intrinsic O
clearance O
for O

Sulfaphenazole, B-Chemical
a O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
inhibitor, O
blocked O
the O
formation O
of O
E-3174 B-Chemical
at O
low O
losartan B-Chemical
concentrations O
(<1 O
microM), O
whereas O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
triacetyloleandomycin, B-Chemical
a O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
inhibitor, O
was O
significant O
only O
at O
high O
concentrations O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
(>25 O
microM). O
In O
comparison O
to O
the O
CYP2C9.1 O
variant, O
oxidation O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
reduced O
in O
yeast B-Species
expressing O
the O
rare O
CYP2C9.2 O
or O
CYP2C9.3 O
variants. O
Moreover, O
the O
rate O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
oxidation O
was O
lower O
in O
liver O
microsomes O
from O
individuals O
hetero- O
or O
homozygous O
for O
the O
CYP2C9*3 O
allele, O
or O
homozygous O
for O
the O
CYP2C9*2 O
allele. O
The O
difference O
between O
the O
common O
and O
rare O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
variants O
was O
mainly O
explained O
by O
a O
lower O
V(max), O
both O
in O
yeast B-Species
and O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes. O
In O
summary, O
these O
in O
vitro O
results O
indicate O
that O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
is O
the O
major O
human B-Species
P450 O
isoenzyme O
responsible O
for O
losartan B-Chemical
oxidation O
and O
that O
the O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
genotype O
contributes O
to O
interindividual O
differences O
in O
losartan B-Chemical
oxidation O
and O
activation. O
