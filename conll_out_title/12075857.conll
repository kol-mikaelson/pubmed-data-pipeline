# Abstract
One O
main O
metabolizing O
pathway O
of O
levodopa B-Chemical
is O
O-methylation O
to O
3-O-methyldopa B-Chemical
(3-OMD) B-Chemical
by O
catechol-O-methyltransferase B-Gene
(COMT). B-Gene
Since O
COMT B-Gene
requires O
Mg2+ B-Chemical
and O
S-adenosylmethionine B-Chemical
as O
methyl O
donor O
for O
this O
transmethylating O
process, O
COMT B-Gene
converts O
S-adenosylmethionine B-Chemical
to O
S-adenosylhomocysteine B-Chemical
and O
subsequent O
homocysteine. B-Chemical
Objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
demonstrate O
relations O
between O
plasma O
levodopa, B-Chemical
3-OMD B-Chemical
and O
total O
homocysteine B-Chemical
in O
treated O
parkinsonian B-Disease
subjects. O
We O
measured O
homocysteine, B-Chemical
levodopa B-Chemical
and O
3-OMD B-Chemical
by O
HPLC. O
We O
compared O
plasma O
homocysteine B-Chemical
in O
two O
groups O
of O
treated O
parkinsonian B-Disease
subjects O
subdivided O
according O
to O
their O
3-OMD B-Chemical
level. O
Homocysteine B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
(p O

elevated O
in O
the O
group O
with O

concentrations O
and O
