# Abstract
Acetylation O
of O
polyamines B-Chemical
by O
spermidine B-Chemical
spermine I-Gene
N(1)-acetyltransferase I-Gene
(SSAT) B-Gene
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
their O
degradation O
and O
or O
export O
out O
of O
the O
cell. O
The O
relationship O
of O
SSAT B-Gene
to O
polyamine B-Chemical
pool O
dynamics O
and O
cell O
growth O
is O
not O
yet O
clearly O
understood. O
MCF-7 B-CellLine
human B-Species
breast B-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
cells O
were O
transfected O
with O
tetracycline-regulated O
(Tet-off) O
SSAT B-Gene
human B-Species
cDNA O
or O
murine B-Species
gene. O
Doxycycline B-Chemical
removal O
for O
>2 O
days O
caused O
a O
approximately O
20-fold O
increase O
in O
SSAT B-Gene
RNA O
and O
a O
approximately O
10-fold O
increase O
in O
enzyme O
activity. O
After O
4 O
days, O
intracellular O
putrescine B-Chemical
and O
spermidine B-Chemical
pools O
were O
markedly O
lowered, O
and O
cell O
growth O
was O
inhibited. O
Growth O
inhibition O
could O
not O
be O
prevented O
with O
exogenous O
polyamines B-Chemical
due O
to O
a O
previously O
unrecognized O
ability O
of O
SSAT B-Gene
to O
rapidly O
acetylate O
influxing O
polyamines B-Chemical
and O
thereby O
prevent O
restoration O
of O
the O
endogenous O
pools. O
Instead, O
cells O
accumulated O
high O
levels O
of O
N(1)-acetylspermidine, B-Chemical
N(1)-acetylspermine, B-Chemical
and O
N(1), B-Chemical
N(12)-diacetylspermine, I-Chemical
a O
metabolite O
not O
previously O
reported O
in O
mammalian O
cells. O
Doxycycline B-Chemical
deprivation O
before O
treatment O
with O
N(1), B-Chemical
N(11)-diethylnorspermine I-Chemical
markedly O
increased O
analog O
induction O
of O
SSAT B-Gene
mRNA O
and O
activity O
and O
enhanced O
growth O
sensitivity O
to O
the O
analog O
by O
approximately O
100-fold. O
Overall, O
the O
findings O
demonstrate O
that O
conditional O
overexpression O
of O
SSAT B-Gene
lowers O
polyamine B-Chemical
pools, O
inhibits O
cell O
growth, O
and O
markedly O
enhances O
growth O
sensitivity O
to O
certain O
analogs. O
The O
enzyme O
also O
plays O
a O
remarkably O
efficient O
role O
in O
maintaining O
polyamine B-Chemical
pool O
homeostasis O
during O
challenges O
with O
exogenous O
polyamines. B-Chemical
