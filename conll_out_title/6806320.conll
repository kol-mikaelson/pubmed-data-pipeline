# Abstract
Formation O
of O
heme, B-Chemical
bilirubin, B-Chemical
and O
bilirubin B-Chemical
conjugates O
has O
been O
examined O
in O
mucosal O
cells O
isolated O
from O
the O
rat B-Species
upper O
small O
intestine. O
Intact, O
viable O
cells O
were O
prepared O
by O
enzymatic O
dissociation O
using O
a O
combined O
vascular O
and O
luminal O
perfusion O
and O
incubated O
with O
an O
isotopically O
labeled O
precursor, O
delta-amino-[2,3-3H]levulinic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Labeled O
heme B-Chemical
and O
bile O
pigment O
were O
formed O
with O
kinetics O
similar O
to O
those O
exhibited O
by O
hepatocytes. O
Moreover, O
the O
newly O
formed O
bilirubin B-Chemical
was O
converted O
rapidly O
to O
both O
mono- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
diglucuronide I-Chemical
conjugates. O
In O
addition, O
cell-free O
extracts O
of O
small O
intestinal O
mucosa O
from O
rats B-Species
or O
humans B-Species
exhibited O
a O
bilirubin-UDP-glucuronyl O
transferase O
activity O
that O
was O
qualitatively O
similar O
to O
that O
present O
in O
liver. O
The O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
small O
intestinal O
mucosa O
normally O
contributes O
to O
bilirubin B-Chemical
metabolism. O
