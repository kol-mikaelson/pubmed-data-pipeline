# Abstract
Obligatory, O
coupled O
cotransport O
of O
Na(+), O
K(+), O
and O
Cl(-) O
by O
cell O
membranes O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
nearly O
every O
animal O
cell O
type. O
This O
review O
examines O
the O
current O
status O
of O
our O
knowledge O
about O
this O
ion O
transport O
mechanism. O
Two O
isoforms O
of O
the O
Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) O
cotransporter O
(NKCC) O
protein O
(approximately O
120-130 O
kDa, O
unglycosylated) O
are O
currently O
known. O
One O
isoform O
(NKCC2) B-Gene
has O
at O
least O
three O
alternatively O
spliced O
variants O
and O
is O
found O
exclusively O
in O
the O
kidney. O
The O
other O
(NKCC1) B-Gene
is O
found O
in O
nearly O
all O
cell O
types. O
The O
NKCC O
maintains O
intracellular O
Cl(-) O
concentration O
([Cl(-)](i)) O
at O
levels O
above O
the O
predicted O
electrochemical O
equilibrium. O
The O
high O
[Cl(-)](i) O
is O
used O
by O
epithelial O
tissues O
to O
promote O
net O
salt B-Chemical
transport O
and O
by O
neural O
cells O
to O
set O
synaptic O
potentials; O
its O
function O
in O
other O
cells O
is O
unknown. O
There O
is O
substantial O
evidence O
in O
some O
cells O
that O
the O
NKCC O
functions O
to O
offset O
osmotically O
induced O
cell O
shrinkage O
by O
mediating O
the O
net O
influx O
of O
osmotically O
active O
ions. O
Whether O
it O
serves O
to O
maintain O
cell O
volume O
under O
euvolemic O
conditons O
is O
less O
clear. O
The O
NKCC O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
cell O
cycle. O
Evidence O
that O
each O
cotransport O
cycle O
of O
the O
NKCC O
is O
electrically O
silent O
is O
discussed O
along O
with O
evidence O
for O
the O
electrically O
neutral O
stoichiometries O
of O
1 O
Na(+):1 O
K(+):2 O
Cl- O
(for O
most O
cells) O
and O
2 O
Na(+):1 O
K(+):3 O
Cl(-) O
(in O
squid O
axon). O
Evidence O
that O
the O
absolute O
dependence O
on O
ATP B-Chemical
of O
the O
NKCC O
is O
the O
result O
of O
regulatory O
phosphorylation O
dephosphorylation O
mechanisms O
is O
decribed. O
Interestingly, O
the O
presumed O
protein O
kinase(s) O
responsible O
has O
not O
been O
identified. O
An O
unusual O
form O
of O
NKCC O
regulation O
is O
by O
[Cl(-)](i). O
[Cl(-)](i) O
in O
the O
physiological O
range O
and O
above O
strongly O
inhibits O
the O
NKCC. O
This O
effect O
may O
be O
mediated O
by O
a O
decrease O
of O
protein O
phosphorylation. O
Although O
the O
NKCC O
has O
been O
studied O
for O
approximately O
20 O
years, O
we O
are O
only O
beginning O
to O
frame O
the O
broad O
outlines O
of O
the O
structure, O
function, O
and O
regulation O
of O
this O
ubiquitous O
ion O
transport O
mechanism. O
