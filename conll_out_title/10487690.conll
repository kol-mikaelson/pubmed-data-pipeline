# Abstract
This O
study O
compared O
the O
enzyme O
activity O
of O
3alpha-hydroxysteroid B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(3alphaHSD) B-Gene
and O
3beta-hydroxysteroid O
dehydrogenase O
(3betaHSD) B-Gene
in O
the O
human B-Species
liver. O
3AlphaHSD B-Gene
was O
found O
in O
both O
microsomal O
and O
cytosolic O
liver O
fractions. O
Contrary O
to O
that O
in O
rat B-Species
liver, O
microsomal O
3alphaHSD B-Gene
activity O
was O
12-fold O
higher O
than O
cytosolic O
3alphaHSD B-Gene
activity, O
and O
3alphaHSD B-Gene
was O
not O
inhibited O
by O
indomethacin B-Chemical

The O
rate O

5alpha-dihydrotestosterone B-Chemical
(DHT) B-Chemical
reduction O
to O
5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol B-Chemical
(3alphaDIOL) B-Chemical
by O
3alphaHSD B-Gene
was O
2 O
times O
higher O

the O
rate O

DHT. B-Chemical
3BetaHSD B-Gene
was O
present O
primarily O

the O
microsomal O

DHT B-Chemical
reduction O

5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol B-Chemical
(3betaDIOL) B-Chemical

3betaHSD B-Gene
was O
3 O
times O
higher O

3betaHSD B-Gene
oxidation O

DHT. B-Chemical
When O
3alphaHSD B-Gene
and O
3betaHSD B-Gene
activities O
were O
compared, O
the O
rate O
of O
DHT B-Chemical
reduction O
by O
3betaHSD B-Gene
was O
3-fold O
lower O
than O
the O
rate O
of O
DHT B-Chemical
reduction O
by O
3alphaHSD. B-Gene
No O
sex O
or O
age O
differences O
were O
found O
in O
either O
3alphaHSD B-Gene
or O
3betaHSD B-Gene
activity. O
As O
the O
activity O
of O
DHT-metabolizing O
enzymes O
is O
not O
sex O
dependent, O
the O
sex O
differences O
in O
plasma O
levels O
of O
3alphaDIOL B-Chemical
glucuronide I-Chemical
probably O
reflect O
differences O
in O
DHT B-Chemical
production O
rather O
than O
in O
DHT B-Chemical
metabolism. O
Comparison O
of O
the O
activities O
of O
3alphaHSD, B-Gene
3betaHSD, B-Gene
and O
androgen O
UDP-glucuronyl O
transferase O
suggests O
that O
the O
major O
pathway O
of O
DHT B-Chemical
metabolism O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
involves O
3alphaHSD B-Gene
reduction O
in O
the O
liver, O
followed O
by O
subsequent O
glucuronidation O
and O
clearance O
via O
the O
kidney. O
