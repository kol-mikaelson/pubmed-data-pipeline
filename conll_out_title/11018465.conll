# Abstract
Sphingosine-1-phosphate O
lyase O
catalyzes O
the O
last O
step O
in O
sphingolipid B-Chemical
breakdown, O
the O
cleavage O
of O
phosphorylated O
sphingoid B-Chemical
bases I-Chemical
such O
as O
sphingenine-1-phosphate. B-Chemical
The O
latter O
lipid B-Chemical
is O
not O
only O
a O
catabolite, O
but O
can O
influence O
as O
an O
inter- O
and O
or O
intracellular O
second O
messenger O
many O
cellular O
processes. O
To O
allow O
