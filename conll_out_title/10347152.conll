# Abstract
L-Serine B-Chemical
metabolism O
in O
rabbit, B-Species
dog, B-Species

human B-Species
livers O
was O
investigated, O
focusing O
on O
the O
relative O
contributions O
of O
the O
three O
pathways, O
one O
initiated O
by O
serine B-Chemical
dehydratase, I-Gene
another O
by O
serine:pyruvate O
alanine:glyoxylate O
aminotransferase O
(SPT B-Gene
AGT), B-Gene
and O
the O
other O
involving O
serine B-Chemical
hydroxymethyltransferase O
and O
the O
mitochondrial O

flux O

serine B-Chemical
dehydratase I-Gene
accounted O
for O
only O

that O

substantially O

no O

whether O
the O

peroxisomes O

As O
for O
flux O
through O
serine B-Chemical
hydroxymethyltransferase O
and O
GCS, O
the O
conversion O
of O
serine B-Chemical

glycine B-Chemical
occurred O
fairly O
rapidly, O
followed O
by O
GCS-mediated O
slow O
decarboxylation O
of O
the O

The O
flux O
through O
GCS O
was O
relatively O
high O
in O
the O
dog B-Species

low O
in O
the O
rabbit, B-Species
and O
only O
in O
the O

was O
it O
comparable O

An O

experiment O
with O
L-[3-3H,14C]serine B-Chemical
as O
the O
substrate O
indicated O
that O
in O
rabbit B-Species
liver, O
gluconeogenesis O
from O
L-serine B-Chemical
proceeds O
mainly O
via O
hydroxypyruvate. B-Chemical
Because O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
conversion O
of O
glyoxylate B-Chemical
to O
glycine B-Chemical
has O
been O
assigned O

from O
the O
studies O
on O

these O
results O
suggest O
that O
SPT B-Gene
AGT B-Gene
in O
this O
organelle O
plays O
dual O
roles O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
glyoxylate B-Chemical
