# Abstract
Lactate B-Chemical
transport O
across O
cell O
membranes O
is O
mediated O
by O
a O
family O
of O
proton-coupled O
monocarboxylate O
transporters O
(MCTs). O
The O

(RPE) B-CellLine
expresses O
a O
unique O
member O
of O
this O
family, O
MCT3. B-Gene
A O

cloned O
by O

identify O
a O
bacterial O
artificial O
chromosome O

the O
human B-Species
MCT3 B-Gene
gene. O
The O
human B-Species
MCT3 B-Gene
cDNA O
contained O

MCT3. B-Gene
Comparison O
of O

revealed O
that O
the O
MCT3 B-Gene
gene O
was O
composed O
of O
five O

kb O
of O
DNA. O
The O
exon-intron O

between O
the O
human B-Species

the O
chicken B-Species
MCT3 B-Gene
genes. O
Using O
radiation O
hybrid O
mapping, O
the O
MCT3 B-Gene
gene O
was O
mapped O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
22 I-Chromosome
between O
