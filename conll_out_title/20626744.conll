# Abstract
X-linked B-Disease
adrenoleukodystrophy I-Disease
(X-ALD) B-Disease
is O
the O
most O
common O
peroxisomal B-Disease
disorder. I-Disease
The O
disease O
is O
characterized O
by O
the O
accumulation O
of O
very O
long-chain B-Chemical

in O
plasma O
and O
tissues. O
X-ALD B-Disease
is O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
ABCD1 B-Gene
gene O
encoding O
ALDP, B-Gene
an O
adenosine O

in O
the O
peroxisomal O

In O
this O
paper, O
we O
describe O
the O
current O

on O
the O
function O
of O
ALDP, B-Gene
its O
role O
in O
peroxisomal O

and O
the O
consequences O
of O
a O

in O
ALDP B-Gene
on O
VLCFA B-Chemical
metabolism. O
Furthermore, O
we O
pay O
special O
attention O
to O
the O
role O
of O
the O
