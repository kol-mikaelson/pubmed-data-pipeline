# Abstract
Standard O
therapy O
in O
the O
United O
States O
for O
malignancy-associated O
hyperuricemia B-Disease
consists O
of O
hydration, O
alkalinization, O
and O
allopurinol. B-Chemical
Urate O
oxidase O
catalyzes O
the O
enzymatic O
oxidation O
of O
uric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
a O
5 O

allantoin. B-Chemical
Rasburicase O
is O
a O
new O
recombinant O
form O
of O
urate O
oxidase O
available O
for O
clinical O
evaluation. O
This O
multicenter O

compared O
allopurinol B-Chemical
to O
rasburicase O
in O
pediatric O
patients B-Species
with O
leukemia B-Disease

at O
high O

Patients B-Species
received O
the O

Fifty-two O

In O
an O
intent-to-treat O

experienced O
a O

Four O

after O
the O
first O

patients B-Species
randomized O
