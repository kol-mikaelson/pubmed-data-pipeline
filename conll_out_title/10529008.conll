# Abstract
In O
this O
work, O
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases O
(UGTs), O
UGT1A3, B-Gene
2B7(H268) O
and O
2B7(Y268), O
stably O
expressed O
in O
human B-Species
embryonic O
kidney O
cells O
(HK293) B-CellLine
were O
used O
to O
assess O
glucuronidation O
activities O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
steroid B-Chemical
hormone I-Chemical
and O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
substrates. O
The O
rate O
of O
synthesis O
of O
carboxyl- O
and O
hydroxyl-linked O
glucuronides B-Chemical
was O
determined O
under O
optimal O
reaction O
conditions. O
Expressed O
UGT1A3 B-Gene
catalyzed O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
glucuronidation O
at O
high O
rates O
exclusively O
at O
the O
carboxyl O
moiety O
for O
all O
compounds O
tested. O
In O
contrast, O
UGT1A4 B-Gene
catalyzed O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
glucuronidation O
at O
very O
low O
rates O
exclusively O
at O
the O
3alpha-hydroxyl O
function. O
Both O
UGT2B7 B-Gene
allelic O
variants O
glucuronidated O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
substrates O
at O
both O
carboxyl O
and O
hydroxyl O
moieties, O
however, O
the O
3alpha-hydroxyl O
position O
was O
preferentially O
conjugated O
compared O
to O
the O
carboxyl O
function. O
Similarly, O
androsterone, B-Chemical
a O
3alpha-hydroxylated B-Chemical
androgenic I-Chemical
steroid, I-Chemical
was O
glucuronidated O
at O
very O
high O
rates O
by O
expressed O
UGT2B7. B-Gene
Of O
the O
estrogenic O
compounds O
tested, O
UGT2B7 B-Gene
catalyzed O
the O
glucuronidation O
of O
estriol B-Chemical
at O
rates O
comparable O
to O
those O
determined O
for O
androsterone. B-Chemical
Other O
structural O

was O
found O
with O
UGT2B7 B-Gene
which O
had O
activity O
toward O
estriol B-Chemical
and O
estradiol B-Chemical
exclusively O
at O
the O
17beta-OH O
position, O
yielding O
