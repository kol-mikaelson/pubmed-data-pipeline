# Abstract
We O
have O
recently O
purified O
a O
cholesteryl B-Gene
ester I-Gene
hydrolase I-Gene
(CEH) B-Gene
from O
rat B-Species
liver O
microsomes. O
Antibodies O
raised O
against O
the O
purified O
protein O
specifically O
reacted O
with O
a O
106-kd O
protein O
and O
neutralized O
90% O
of O
the O
CEH B-Gene
activity O
of O
rat B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
(J O
Lipid O
Res O
1999;40:715-725). O
In O
this O
work O
we O
have O
used O
the O
anti-CEH O
antibody O
to O
study O
both O
the O
subcellular O
distribution O
of O
the O
protein O
in O
hepatocytes O
as O
well O
as O
its O
tissue-specific O
expression O
in O
rat. B-Species
Western O
blotting O
of O
subcellular O
fractions O
obtained O
from O
isolated O
rat B-Species
hepatocytes O
revealed O
that O
the O
immunoreactive O
106-kd O
CEH B-Gene
was O
exclusively O
localized O
in O
microsomes. O
The O
antibody O
also O
recognized O
a O
106-kd O
protein O
in O
microsomes O
from O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
liver O
but O
not O
from O
rat B-Species
nonparenchymal O
liver O
cells. O
Confocal O
microscopy O
of O
HepG2 B-CellLine
cells O
revealed O
that O
CEH B-Gene
immunoreactive O
material O
colocalized O
with O
calnexin, B-Gene
a O
marker O
of O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum. O
Furthermore, O
high-resolution O
immunoelectron O
microscopy O
of O
rat B-Species
liver O
thin O
sections O
exclusively O
localized O
the O
CEH B-Gene
immunoreactivity O
to O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
of O
the O
hepatocyte. O
No O
CEH B-Gene
immunoreactivity O
was O
observed O
in O
microsomes O
derived O
from O
adrenal O
glands, O
ovaries, O
testis, O
pancreas, O
intestine, O
white O
adipose O
tissue, O
mammary O
gland, O
lung, O
spleen, O
brain, O
aorta, O
and O
macrophages. O
We O
report O
a O
CEH B-Gene
localized O
to O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum, O
erCEH, O
in O
the O
mammalian O
hepatocyte. O
The O
subcellular O
localization O
and O
tissue-restricted O
pattern O
of O
expression O
of O
erCEH O
suggests O
that O
it O
might O
have O
unique O
functions O
in O
liver O
cholesterol O
metabolism. O
