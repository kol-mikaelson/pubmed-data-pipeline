# Abstract
GLUT3 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
rat B-Species
muscle, O
but O
this O
glucose O
transporter O
protein O
has O
not O
been O
identified O
previously O
in O
adult O
human B-Species
skeletal O
muscle. O
We O
quantified O
the O
rapidity O
of O
disappearance O
of O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
from O
human B-Species
skeletal O

Fifty O

GLUT3 B-Gene

Previous O
conclusions O
that O
GLUT3 B-Gene
is O
not O
expressed O
in O
human B-Species
muscle O
were O
likely O
drawn O
because O
of O
artifacts O
related O
to O
degradation O
of O
GLUT3 B-Gene
protein O
in O
the O
specimens O
prior O
to O
study. O
Because O
of O
the O
rapid O
degradation O
of O
protein O
and O
mRNA, O
autopsy O
specimens O
of O
muscle O
must O
be O
obtained O
within O
6 O
hours O
of O
death, O
and O
even O
then, O
protein O
and O
mRNA O
data O
will O
likely O
dramatically O
underestimate O
their O
expression O
in O
fresh O
muscle. O
Some O
previously O
published O
conclusions O
and O
recommendations O
regarding O
autopsy O
specimens O
are O
not O
stringent O
enough O
to O
consistently O
yield O
useful O
protein O
and O
mRNA. O
