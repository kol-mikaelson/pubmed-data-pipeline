Acetylcholinesterase--new O
roles O
for O
an O
old O
actor. O

# Abstract
The O
discovery O
of O
the O
first O
neurotransmitter--acetylcholine--was O
soon O
followed O
by O
the O
discovery O
of O
its O
hydrolysing O
enzyme, O
acetylcholinesterase. B-Gene
The O
role O
of O
acetylcholinesterase B-Gene
in O
terminating O
acetylcholine-mediated O
neurotransmission O
made O
it O
the O
focus O
of O
intense O
research O
for O
much O
of O
the O
past O
century. O
But O
the O
complexity O
of O
acetylcholinesterase B-Gene
gene O
regulation O
and O
recent O
evidence O
for O
some O
of O
the O
long-suspected O
'non-classical' O
actions O
of O
this O
enzyme O
have O
more O
recently O
driven O
a O
profound O
revolution O
in O
acetylcholinesterase B-Gene
research. O
Although O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
additional O
roles O
of O
acetylcholinesterase B-Gene
is O
incomplete, O
the O
time O
is O
ripe O
to O
summarize O
the O
evidence O
on O
a O
remarkable O
diversity O
of O
acetylcholinesterase B-Gene
functions. O
