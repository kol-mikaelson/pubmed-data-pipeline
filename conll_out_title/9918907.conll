# Abstract
Administration O
of O
angiotensin B-Gene
II I-Gene
causes O
an O
increase O
in O
portal O
pressure, O
and O
plasma O
concentration O
of O
angiotensin B-Gene
II I-Gene
is O
elevated O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
cirrhosis, B-Disease
suggesting O
that O
angiotensin B-Gene
II I-Gene
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
portal B-Disease
hypertension I-Disease
in O
cirrhosis. B-Disease
We O
evaluated O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
orally O

angiotensin B-Gene
II I-Gene
receptor O
antagonist, O
losartan, B-Chemical
on O

treated O
with O
an O
oral O
dose O

25 O

losartan B-Chemical
once O

10 O

respectively, O
cirrhotic B-Disease
controls. O
On O
the O
seventh O
day, O
HVPG B-Chemical
was O
determined O
again, O
and O
blood O

rate, O
body O
weight, O
and O
parameters O
of O
liver O

kidney O
function O
were O
recorded. O
Losartan B-Chemical
induced O
a O

decrease O
of O
HVPG B-Chemical
in O
the O
patients B-Species
with O

portal B-Disease
hypertension, I-Disease
while O
no O
significant O
change O
was O
seen O
in O
the O

Losartan B-Chemical
caused O
a O

One O

with O
losartan B-Chemical
had O
a O
short O
symptomatic O
hypotensive B-Disease
reaction O
after O
the O
first O
dose O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
that O
did O
not O
recur O
despite O
continued O
treatment. O
No O
deterioration B-Disease
of I-Disease
liver I-Disease
or I-Disease
kidney I-Disease

was O
observed. O
The O
present O
study O
indicates O
that O
angiotensin B-Gene

is O
safe O
