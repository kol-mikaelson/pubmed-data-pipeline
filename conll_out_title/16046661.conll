# Abstract
Hepatobiliary O
elimination O
of O
many O
organic B-Chemical
anions I-Chemical
is O
initiated O
by O
OATP1B1 B-Gene
(OATP2, B-Gene
LST-1, B-Gene
OATP-C), B-Gene
OATP1B3 B-Gene
(OATP8), B-Gene
and O
OATP2B1 B-Gene
(OATP-B), B-Gene
which O
are O
the O
predominant O
uptake O
transporters O
of O
human B-Species
hepatocytes. O
Thereafter, O
the O
unidirectional O
efflux O
pump O
ABCC2 B-Gene
(multidrug O
resistance O
protein O
2) O
mediates O
the O
transport O
of O
organic B-Chemical
anions, I-Chemical
including O
glutathione B-Chemical
conjugates O
and O
glucuronosides, B-Chemical
into O
bile. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
generated O
a O
Madin-Darby B-CellLine
canine I-CellLine
kidney I-CellLine
(MDCKII) B-CellLine
cell O
line O
stably O
expressing O
recombinant O
OATP1B1, B-Gene
OATP1B3, B-Gene
and O
OATP2B1 B-Gene
in O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
and O
ABCC2 B-Gene
in O
the O
apical O
membrane. O
Double-transfected O
MDCKII B-CellLine
cells O
stably O
expressing O
ABCC2 B-Gene
together O
with O
OATP1B1, B-Gene
OATP1B3, B-Gene
or O
OATP2B1 B-Gene
served O
as O
control O
cells. O
The O
quadruple-transfected O
cells O
exhibited O
high O
rates O
of O
vectorial O
transport O
of O
organic B-Chemical
anions, I-Chemical
including O
bromosulfophthalein, B-Chemical
cholecystokinin O
peptide O
(CCK-8), B-Chemical
and O
estrone B-Chemical
3-sulfate. I-Chemical
The O
quadruple-transfected O
cells O
enabled O
the O
identification O
of O
substrates O
for O
uptake O
or O
vectorial O
transport O
that O
may O
be O
missed O
in O
studies O
with O
a O
double-transfected O
cell O
line, O
as O
exemplified O
by O
CCK-8, B-Chemical
which O
is O
a O
substrate O
for O
OATP1B3 B-Gene
but O
not O
for O
OATP1B1 B-Gene
or O
OATP2B1. B-Gene
The O
broad O
substrate O
spectrum O
covered O
by O
the O
three O
hepatocellular O
OATP O
transporters O
enables O
representative O
analyses O
of O
the O
uptake O
of O
many O
organic B-Chemical
anions I-Chemical
into O
human B-Species
hepatocytes. O
The O
broad O
spectrum O
of O
organic B-Chemical
anions I-Chemical
transported O
vectorially O
by O
the O
quadruple-transfected O
cells O
also O
provides O
valuable O
information O
on O
the O

without O
the O
need O

studies O
in O

protein. O
The O
quadruple-transfected O

cells O
may O
thus O
be O
useful O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
substrates O
and O
inhibitors, O
including O
drug O
candidates, O
undergoing O
uptake O
and O
secretion O
by O
human B-Species
hepatocytes, O
under O
conditions O
that O
may O
be O
better O
defined O

in O
primary O
cultures O
of O
human B-Species
