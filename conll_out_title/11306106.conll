# Abstract
Daidzin, B-Chemical
a O
major O
active O
principle O
of O
an O
ancient O
herbal O
treatment O
for O
'alcohol B-Chemical
addiction', I-Disease
was O
first O
shown O
to O
suppress O
ethanol B-Chemical
intake O
in O
Syrian B-Species
golden B-Species
hamsters. I-Species
Since O
then O
this O
activity O
has O
been O
confirmed O
in O
Wistar O

under O
various O
experimental O
conditions, O
including O
two-level O
operant, O
two-bottle O
free-choice, O
limited O
access, O
and O
alcohol-deprivation O
paradigms. O
In O
vitro, O
daidzin B-Chemical
is O
a O
potent O
and O
selective O
inhibitor O
of O
mitochondrial O
aldehyde B-Chemical
dehydrogenase O
(ALDH-2). B-Gene
However, O
in O
vivo, O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
overall O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
metabolism O
in O

Using O
isolated O

liver O
mitochondria O
and O
5-hydroxytryptamine B-Chemical
(5-HT) B-Chemical
and O
dopamine B-Chemical
(DA) B-Chemical
as O
the O
substrates, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
daidzin B-Chemical
inhibits O
the O

not O
the O
first O
step O
of O
the O
MAO O

the O

that O
catalyzes O
monoamine B-Chemical

Correlation O
studies O
using O

led O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O
mitochondrial O
MAO O

may O

the O
site O
