# Abstract
Computer-based O
approaches O
identified O
PTE2 B-Gene
as O
a O
candidate O
human B-Species
peroxisomal O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
thioesterase O
gene. O
The O
PTE2 B-Gene
gene O
product O
is O
highly O
similar O
to O
the O
rat B-Species
cytosolic O
and O
mitochondrial O
thioesterases, O
CTE1 B-Gene
and O
MTE1, B-Gene
respectively, O
and O
terminates O
in O
a O
tripeptide O

serine-lysine-valine(COOH), O
that O
resembles O
the O
consensus O

for O
type-1 O
peroxisomal O

PTE2 B-Gene
was O
targeted O

and O
recombinant O
PTE2 B-Gene
showed O

A O
comparison O
of O
PTE2 B-Gene

indicated O
that O
while O
PTE1 B-Gene

The O
identification O
of O
PTE2 B-Gene
therefore O
offers O
an O
