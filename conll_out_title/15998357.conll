# Abstract
Statins O
are O
involved O
in O
different O
types O
of O
drug O
interactions. O
Our O
objective O
was O
to O
study O
the O
effect O
of O
statins O
on O
cytochrome O
P450 O
(CYP) O
2C8-mediated O
paclitaxel B-Chemical
6 O
alpha-hydroxylation O
by O
incubating O
paclitaxel B-Chemical
and O
statins O
(0--100 O
microM) O
with O
pooled O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes. O
Simvastatin, B-Chemical
lovastatin, B-Chemical
atorvastatin B-Chemical
and O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
were O
the O
most O
potent O
inhibitors O
of O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
activity O

respectively. O
Cerivastatin, B-Chemical
simvastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
lovastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
were O
less O
potent O
inhibitors O
with O
K(i) O
(IC(50)) O
values O
ranging O
from O
32 O
to O
55 O
(30--67) O
microM. O
Rosuvastatin B-Chemical
and O
pravastatin B-Chemical
showed O
no O
appreciable O
effect O
on O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
activity O
even O
at O
100 O
microM. O
In O
conclusion, O
all O
the O
statins O
tested, O
except O
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
and O
pravastatin, B-Chemical
had O
a O
significant O
inhibitory O
effect O
on O
the O
activity O
of O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
in O
vitro. O
Because O
many O
of O
the O
statins O
accumulate O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
because O
also O
their O
metabolites O
may O
inhibit O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
activity, O
in O
vivo O
studies O
are O
needed O
to O
investigate O
a O
possible O
interaction O
of O
simvastatin, B-Chemical
lovastatin, B-Chemical
atorvastatin B-Chemical
and O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
with O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
substrate O
