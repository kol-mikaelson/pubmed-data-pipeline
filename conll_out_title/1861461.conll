# Abstract
The O
concentrations O
of O
2-methylacetoacetate, B-Chemical
2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate B-Chemical
and O
tiglylglycine B-Chemical
were O
determined O
by O
gas O
chromatography-mass O
spectrometry O
in O
urine O
collected O
before O
and O
for O
8 O
h O
after O
loading O
with O
100 O
mg O
of O
isoleucine B-Chemical

The O
sum O
of O
2-methylacetoacetate B-Chemical
and O
2-butanone, B-Chemical
a O
decarboxylation O
product, O
was O
determined O
as O
the O
2-butanone B-Chemical
dinitrophenylhydrazone I-Chemical

of O
2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate B-Chemical
