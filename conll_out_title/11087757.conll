The O

NDST4 B-Gene

NDST1, B-Gene

NDST4 B-Gene

These O

suggest O
that O
the O

a O

Comparison O

the O
four O

N-deacetylation O

activities; O
NDST4 B-Gene
had O
weak O
deacetylase O

high O
sulfotransferase, O
whereas O
NDST3 B-Gene
had O
the O
opposite O
properties. O
Molecular O

suggesting O
that O
the O
differences O

may O
reflect O
