# Abstract
Human B-Species
liver O
peroxisomes O
contain O
two O
acyl-CoA O
oxidases, O
namely, O
palmitoyl-CoA B-Chemical
oxidase I-Gene
and O
a O
branched B-Gene
chain I-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
oxidase. I-Gene
The O
palmitoyl-CoA B-Chemical
oxidase I-Gene
(ACOX) B-Gene
oxidizes O
the O
CoA B-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
of O
straight O
chain O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
prostaglandins B-Chemical
and O
donates O
electrons O
directly O
to O
molecular O

thereby O
producing O

We O
have O

that O
the O

Using O
the O

The O

identified O
in O
the O
