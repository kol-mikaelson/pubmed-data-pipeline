# Abstract
Nutrient O
digestion O
and O
absorption O
is O
necessary O
for O
the O
survival O
of O
living O
organisms O
and O
has O
evolved O
into O
the O
complex O
and O
specific O
task O
of O
the O
gastrointestinal O
(GI) O
system. O
While O
most O
people O
simply O
assume O
that O
their O
GI O
tract O
will O
work O
properly O
to O
use O
nutrients, O
provide O
energy, O
and O
release O
wastes, O
few O
nonscientists O
know O
the O
details O
about O
how O
various O
nutrients O
are O
digested O
and O
how O
the O
breakdown O
products O
traverse O
the O
cells O
lining O
the O
small O
intestine O
to O
reach O
the O
blood O
stream O
and O
to O
be O
used O
by O
the O
other O
cells O
of O
the O
body. O
There O
have O
been O
several O
recent O
discoveries O
of O
new O
transporters O
that O
likely O
contribute O
to O
the O
absorption O
of O
oligopeptides B-Chemical
and O
fatty O
acids. O
In O
addition, O
details O
are O
being O
clarified O
about O
how O
transporters O
work O
and O
in O
what O
forms O
nutrients O
can O
be O
absorbed. O
The O
enzymes O
that O
digest O
basic O
carbohydrates, O
proteins, O
and O
fats O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
various O
segments O
of O
the O
GI O
tract, O
and O
details O
are O
becoming O
clearer O
about O
what O
types O
of O
bonds O
they O
hydrolyze. O
Usually, O
detailed O
information O
about O
the O
digestion O
of O
basic O
nutrients O
is O
presented O
and O
learned O
in O
biochemistry O
courses O
and O
detailed O
information O
about O
absorption O
via O
transepithelial O
transport O
of O
the O
breakdown O
products O
of O
digestion O
is O
studied O
in O
physiology O
courses. O
The O
goal O
of O
this O
Staying O
Current O
article O
is O
to O
combine O
the O
details O
of O
the O
biochemistry O
of O
digestion O
with O
the O
updated O
information O
about O
the O
physiology O
of O
nutrient O
absorption O
into O
one O
source O
for O
teachers O
of O
physiology. O
Insights O
are O
included O
about O
some O
of O
the O
diseases O
and O
conditions O
that O
can O
bring O
about O
malabsorption O
of O
food O
in O
the O
GI O
tract O
and O
their O
consequences. O
