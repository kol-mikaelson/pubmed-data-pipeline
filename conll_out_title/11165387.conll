# Abstract
Creatine B-Chemical
is O
synthesized O
from O
arginine B-Chemical
by O
L-arginine:glycine B-Gene
amidinotransferase I-Gene
(AGAT) O
and O
S-adenosyl-L-methionine:N-guanidinoacetate B-Gene
methyltransferase I-Gene
(GAMT) B-Gene
and O
can O
be O
taken O
up O
by O
cells O
by O
creatine B-Chemical
transporters O
(CRT). O
While O
creatine B-Chemical
is O
mainly O
synthesized O
by O
the O
liver O
and O
the O
kidney, O
most O
of O
other O
tissues, O
including O
the O
brain, O
also O
express O
AGAT O
and O
GAMT. B-Gene
There O
is O
evidence O
that O
the O
permeability O
of O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
(BBB) O
for O
creatine B-Chemical
is O
limited, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
brain O
is O
dependent O
on O
its O
own O
creatine B-Chemical
synthesis. O
In O
order O
to O
better O
understand O
creatine B-Chemical
synthesis O
and O
transport O
in O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
(CNS), O
we O
studied O
the O
regional O
distribution O
of O
cells O
expressing O
AGAT, O
GAMT B-Gene
and O
the O
creatine B-Chemical
transporter O
CRT1 O
in O
the O
adult O
rat B-Species
brain O
by O
non-radioisotopic O
in O
situ O
hybridization. O
AGAT O
and O
GAMT B-Gene
presented O
an O
ubiquitous O
neuronal O
and O
glial O
expression, O
whereas O
CRT1 O
was O
present O
in O
neurons O
and O
oligodendrocytes O
throughout O
the O
brain, O
but O
not O
in O
astrocytes. O
This O
indicates O
that O
all O
cells O
in O
the O
CNS O
can O
synthesize O
creatine B-Chemical
from O
arginine. B-Chemical
The O
absence O
of O
expression O
of O
CRT1 O
in O
astrocytes O
and O
particularly O
in O
those O
contacting O
capillary O
endothelial O
cells O
(BBB) O
reinforces O
the O
idea O
that O
under O
normal O
conditions O
the O
creatine B-Chemical
used O
by O
the O
brain O
is O
synthesized O
mainly O
in O
the O
CNS. O
Furthermore, O
the O
expression O
of O
CRT1 O
by O
neurons O
and O
oligodendrocytes O
indicates O
that O
creatine B-Chemical
trafficking O
is O
possible O
in O
those O
brain O
areas O
of O
main O
creatine B-Chemical
consumption. O
