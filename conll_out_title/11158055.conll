# Abstract
3 O
alpha-Hydroxysteroid O
dehydrogenases O
(3 O
alpha-HSDs) O
catalyze O
the O
conversion O
of O
3-ketosteroids B-Chemical
to O
3 B-Chemical
alpha-hydroxy I-Chemical
compounds. I-Chemical
The O
best O
known O
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD I-Gene
activity O
is O
the O
transformation O
of O
the O
most O
potent O
natural O
androgen, O
dihydrotestosterone, B-Chemical
into O
5 B-Chemical
alpha-androstan-3 I-Chemical
alpha,17 I-Chemical
beta-diol I-Chemical
(3 B-Chemical
alpha-diol), I-Chemical
a O
compound O
having O
much O
lower O
activity. O
Previous O
reports O
show O
that O
3 O
alpha-HSDs O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
glucocorticoids, O
progestins, O
prostaglandins, B-Chemical
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
precursors, O
and O
xenobiotics. O
3 O
alpha-HSDs O
could, O
thus, O
play O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
the O
control O
of O
a O
series O
of O
active O
steroid B-Chemical
levels O
in O
target O
tissues. O
In O
the O
human, B-Species
type O
1 O
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD I-Gene
was O
first O
identified O
as O
human B-Species
chlordecone O
reductase. O
Recently, O
we O
have O
isolated O
and O
characterized O
type O
3 O
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD I-Gene
that O
shares O
81.7% O
identity O
with O
human B-Species
type O

alpha-HSD. I-Gene
The O

in O
transformed O
human B-Species
embryonic O
kidney O

indicates O
that O
both O
enzymes O
efficiently O
catalyze O
the O
transformation O
of O
dihydrotestosterone B-Chemical
into O
3 B-Chemical
alpha-diol I-Chemical
in O
intact O
cells. O
However, O
when O
the O
cells O
are O
broken, O
the O
activity O
of O
type O
3 O
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD I-Gene
is O
rapidly O
lost, O
whereas O
the O
type O
1 O
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD I-Gene
activity O
remains O
stable. O
We O
have O
previously O
found O
that O
human B-Species
type O
5 O
17 O
beta-HSD O
which O
possesses O
84% O
and O
86% O
identity O
with O
types O
1 O
and O
3 O
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD, I-Gene
respectively, O
is O
also O
labile, O
whereas O
rodent O

such O

mouse B-Species
type O

17 O
beta-HSD O
and O
rat B-Species
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD I-Gene
are O
stable O
after O
homogenization O
of O
the O
cells. O
The O
variable O
stability O
of O
different O
enzymatic O
activities O
in O
broken O
cell O
preparations O
renders O
the O
comparison O
of O
different O
enzymes O
difficult. O
RNA O
expression O
analysis O
indicates O
that O
human B-Species
type O
1 O
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD I-Gene
is O
expressed O
exclusively O
in O
the O
liver, O
whereas O
type O
3 O
is O
more O
widely O
expressed O
and O
is O
found O
in O
the O
liver, O
adrenal, O
testis, O
brain, O
prostate, O
and O
HaCaT O
keratinocytes. O
Based O
on O
enzymatic O
characteristics O
and O
sequence O
homology, O
it O
is O
suggested O
that O
type O
1 O
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD I-Gene
is O
an O
ortholog O
of O
rat B-Species
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD I-Gene
while O
type O
3 O
3 B-Gene
alpha-HSD, I-Gene
which O
must O
have O
diverged O
recently, O
seems O
unique O
to O
human B-Species
and O
is O
probably O
more O
involved O
in O
intracrine O
activity. O
