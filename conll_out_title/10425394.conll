# Abstract
The O
recent O
identification O
of O
cDNA O
clones O
for O
phospholipase O
D1 O
and O
2 O
has O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
new O
studies O
on O
its O
structure O
and O
regulation. O
PLD O
activity O
is O
encoded O
by O
at O
least O
two O
different O
genes O
that O
contain O
catalytic O
domains O
that O
relate O
their O
mechanism O
of O
action O
to O
phosphodiesterases. O
In O
vivo O
roles O
for O
PLD O
suggest O
that O
it O
may O
be O
important O
for O
multiple O
specialized O
steps O
in O
receptor O
dependent O
and O
constitutive O
processes O
of O
secretion, O
endocytosis, O
and O
membrane O
biogenesis. O
