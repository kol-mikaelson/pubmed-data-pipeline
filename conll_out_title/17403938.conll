# Abstract
Among O
the O
human B-Species
diseases O
that O
result O
from O
abnormalities O
in O
mitochondrial O
genome O
stability O
or O
maintenance O
are O
several O
that O
result O
from O
mutations O
affecting O
enzymes O
of O
deoxyribonucleoside B-Chemical
triphosphate I-Chemical
(dNTP) B-Chemical
metabolism. O
In O
addition, O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
the O
toxicity B-Disease
of O
antiviral O
nucleoside B-Chemical
analogs I-Chemical
is O
determined O
in O
part O
by O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
their O
intracellular O
conversion O
to O
dNTP B-Chemical
analogs O
occurs O
within O
the O
mitochondrion. O
Finally, O
recent O
work O
from O
this O
laboratory O
has O
shown O
considerable O
variation O
among O
different O
mammalian O
tissues O
with O
respect O
to O
mitochondrial O
dNTP B-Chemical
pool O
sizes O
and O
has O
suggested O
that O
natural O
asymmetries O
in O
mitochondrial O
dNTP B-Chemical
concentrations O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
high O
rates O
at O
which O
the O
mitochondrial O
genome O
undergoes O
mutation. O
These O
factors O
suggest O
that O
much O
more O
information O
is O
needed O
about O
maintenance O
and O
regulation O
of O
dNTP B-Chemical
pools O
within O
mammalian O
mitochondria. O
This O
review O
summarizes O
our O
current O
understanding O
and O
suggests O
directions O
for O
future O
research. O
