# Abstract
The O
glyoxylate B-Chemical
cycle O
provides O
the O
means O
to O
convert O
C2-units O
to O
C4-precursors O
for O
biosynthesis, O
allowing O
growth O
on O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
C2-compounds. O
The O
conventional O
view O
that O
the O
glyoxylate B-Chemical
cycle O
is O
contained O
within O
peroxisomes O
in O
fungi O
and O
plants O
is O
no O
longer O
valid. O
Glyoxylate B-Chemical
cycle O
enzymes O
are O
located O
both O
inside O
and O
outside O
the O
peroxisome. O
Thus, O
the O
operation O
of O
the O
glyoxylate B-Chemical
cycle O
requires O
transport O
of O
several O
intermediates O
across O
the O
peroxisomal O
membrane. O
Glyoxylate B-Chemical
cycle O
progression O
is O
also O
dependent O
upon O
mitochondrial O
metabolism. O
An O
understanding O
of O
the O
operation O
and O
regulation O
of O
the O
glyoxylate B-Chemical
cycle, O
and O
its O
integration O
with O
cellular O
metabolism, O
will O
require O
further O
investigation O
of O
the O
participating O
metabolite O
transporters O
in O
the O
peroxisomal O
membrane. O
