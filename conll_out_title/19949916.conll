# Abstract
OBJECTIVES: O
This O
review O
attempts O
to O
bring O
together O
information O
from O
a O
large O
number O
of O
recent O
studies O
on O
the O
clinical O
uses, O
safety O
and O
pharmacological O
properties O
of O
ibuprofen. B-Chemical
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
is O
widely O
used O
in O
many O
countries O
for O
the O
relief O
of O
symptoms O
of O
pain, B-Disease
inflammation B-Disease
and O
fever. B-Disease
The O
evidence O
for O
modes O
of O
action O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
are O
considered O
in O
relation O
to O
its O
actions O
in O
controlling O
inflammation, B-Disease
pain B-Disease
and O
fever, B-Disease
as O
well O
as O
the O
adverse O
effects O
of O
the O
drug. O
SUMMARY O
OF O
OUTCOMES: O
At O
low O
doses O
(800-1,200 O
mg O
day(-1)) O
which O
in O
many O
countries O
are O
approved O
for O
non-prescription O
(over-the-counter) O
sale O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
has O
a O
good O
safety O
profile O
comparable O
with O
paracetamol. B-Chemical
Its O
analgesic O
activity O
is O
linked O
to O
its O
anti-inflammatory O
effects O
and O
is O
related O
to O
reduction O
in O
the O
ex O
vivo O
production O
in O
blood O
of O
cyclo-oxygenase B-Gene
(COX)-1 B-Gene
and O
COX-2 B-Gene
derived O
prostanoids. B-Chemical
Higher O
prescription O
doses O
(circa O
1,800-2,400 O
mg O
day(-1)) O
are O
employed O
long-term O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
rheumatic B-Disease
and O
other O
more O
severe O
musculo-skeletal O
conditions. O
Recent O
evidence O
from O
large-scale O
clinical O
trials O
with O
the O
newer O
coxibs, O
where O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
was O
as O
a O
comparator, O
have O
confirmed O
earlier O
studies O
which O
have O
shown O
that O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
has O
comparable O
therapeutic O
benefits O
with O
coxibs O
and O
other O
NSAIDs. O
For O
long-term O
usage O
(6+ O
months) O
there O
are O
greater O
numbers O
of O
drop-outs O
due O
to O
reduced O
effectiveness O
of O
therapy, O
a O
feature O
which O
is O
common O
with O
NSAIDs. O
Spontaneous O
reports O
of O
adverse O
events O
and O
adverse O
drug O
reactions O
(ADRs) O
in O
clinical O
trails O
from O
long-term O
coxib O
comparator O
studies, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
epidemiological O
studies, O
shows O
that O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
has O
relatively O
low O
risks O
for O
gastro-intestinal O
(GI), O
hepato-renal O
and O
other, O
rarer, O
ADRs O
compared O
with O
other O
NSAIDs O
and O
coxibs. O
A O
slightly O
higher O
risk O
of O
cardiovascular O
(CV) O
events O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
some, O
but O
not O
all O
studies, O
but O
the O
risks O
are O
in O
general O
lower O
than O
with O
some O
coxibs O
and O
diclofenac. B-Chemical
The O
possibility O
that O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
may O
interfere O
with O
the O
anti-platelet O
effects O
of O
aspirin, B-Chemical
though O
arguably O
of O
low O
grade O
or O
significance, O
has O
given O
rise O
to O
caution O
on O
its O
use O
in O
patients B-Species
that O
are O
at O
risk O
for O
CV B-Disease
conditions I-Disease
that O
take O
aspirin B-Chemical
for O
preventing O
these O
conditions. O
Paediatric O
use O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
is O
reviewed O
and O
the O
main O
results O
are O
that O
the O
drug O
is O
relatively O
safe O
and O
effective O
as O
a O
treatment O
of O
acute B-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
fever. B-Disease
It O
is O
probably O
more O
effective O
than O
paracetamol B-Chemical
as O
an O
antipyretic. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
assessment O
of O
the O
safety O
and O
benefits O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
can O
be O
summarized O
thus: O
(1) O
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
at O
OTC O
doses O
has O
low O
possibilities O
of O
serious O
GI B-Disease
events, I-Disease
and O
little O
prospect O
of O
developing O
renal B-Disease
and O
associated O
CV O
events. O
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
OTC I-Chemical
does O
not O
represent O
a O
risk O
for O
developing O
liver B-Disease
injury I-Disease
especially O
the O
irreversible O
liver B-Disease
damage I-Disease
observed O
with O
paracetamol B-Chemical
and O
the O
occasional O
liver B-Disease
reactions I-Disease
from O
aspirin. B-Chemical
(2) O
The O
pharmacokinetic O
properties O
of O
ibuprofen, B-Chemical
especially O
the O
short O
plasma O
half-life O
of O
elimination, O
lack O
of O
development O
of O
pathologically O
related O
metabolites O
(e.g. O
covalent O
modification O
of O
liver O
proteins O
by O
the O
quinine-imine O
metabolite O
of O
paracetamol B-Chemical
or O
irreversible O
acetylation O
of O
biomolecules O
by O
aspirin) B-Chemical
are O
support O
for O
the O
view O
that O
these O
pharmacokinetic O
and O
notably O
metabolic O
effects O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
favour O
its O
low O
toxic O
potential. O
(3) O
The O
multiple O
actions O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
in O
controlling O
inflammation B-Disease
combine O
with O
moderate O
inhibition O
of O
COX-1 B-Gene
and O
COX-2 B-Gene
and O
low O
residence O
time O
of O
the O
drug O
in O
the O
body O
may O
account O
for O
the O
low O
GI, O
CV O
and O
renal B-Disease
risks O
from O
ibuprofen, B-Chemical
especially O
at O
OTC O
doses. O
