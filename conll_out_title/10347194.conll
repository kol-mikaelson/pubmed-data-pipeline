# Abstract
The O
K+-Cl- B-Chemical
cotransporters O
(KCCs) O
belong O
to O
the O
gene O
family O
of O
electroneutral O
cation-chloride O
cotransporters, O
which O
also O
includes O
two O
bumetanide-sensitive O
Na+-K+-2Cl- O
cotransporters O
and O
a O
thiazide-sensitive O
Na+-Cl- B-Gene
cotransporter. I-Gene
We O
have O
cloned O
cDNAs O
encoding O
mouse B-Species
KCC3, B-Gene
human B-Species
KCC3, B-Gene
and O
human B-Species
KCC4, B-Gene
three O
new O
members O
of O
this O
gene O
family. O
The O
KCC3 B-Gene
and O
KCC4 B-Gene
cDNAs O
predict O
proteins O
of O
1083 O
and O
1150 O
amino O
acids, O
respectively. O
The O
KCC3 B-Gene
and O
KCC4 B-Gene
proteins O
are O
65-71% O
identical O
to O
the O
previously O
characterized O
transporters O
KCC1 B-Gene
and O
KCC2, B-Gene
with O
which O
they O
share O
a O
predicted O
membrane O
topology. O
The O
four O
KCC O
proteins O
differ O
at O
amino O
acid O
residues O
within O
key O
transmembrane O
domains O
and O
in O
the O
distribution O
of O
putative O
phosphorylation O
sites O
within O
the O
amino- O
and O
carboxyl-terminal O
cytoplasmic O
domains. O
The O
expression O
of O
mouse B-Species
KCC3 B-Gene
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
reveals O
the O
expected O
functional O
characteristics O
of O
a O
K+Cl- B-Chemical
cotransporter: O
Cl--dependent O
uptake O
of O
86Rb+ B-Chemical
which O
is O
strongly O
activated O
by O

and O
weakly O

furosemide. B-Chemical
A O
direct O
functional O
comparison O
of O
mouse B-Species
KCC3 B-Gene
to O
rabbit B-Species
KCC1 B-Gene
indicates O
that O
KCC3 B-Gene
has O
a O
much O
greater O
volume O
sensitivity. O
The O
human B-Species
KCC3 B-Gene
and O
KCC4 B-Gene
genes O
are O
located O
on O
chromosomes O
5p15 B-Chromosome
and O
15q14, B-Chromosome
respectively. O
Although O
widely O
expressed, O
KCC3 B-Gene
transcripts O
are O
the O
most O
abundant O
in O
heart O
and O
kidney, O
and O
KCC4 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
muscle, O
brain, O
lung, O
heart, O
and O
kidney. O
The O
unexpected O
molecular O
heterogeneity O
of O
K+-Cl- B-Chemical
cotransport O
has O
implications O
for O
the O
physiology O
and O
pathophysiology O
of O
a O
