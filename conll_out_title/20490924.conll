# Abstract
Oxidation O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
in O
mitochondria O
is O
a O
key O
physiological O
process O
in O
higher O
eukaryotes O
including O
humans. B-Species
The O
importance O
of O
the O
mitochondrial O
beta-oxidation O
system O
in O
humans B-Species
is O
exemplified O
by O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
group O
of O
genetic B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
in O
man B-Species
caused O
by O
an O
impairment O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
oxidation O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
Identification O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
a O
defect O
in O
mitochondrial O
beta-oxidation O
has O
long O
remained O
notoriously O
difficult, O
but O
the O
introduction O
of O
tandem-mass O
spectrometry O
in O
laboratories O
for O
genetic O
metabolic B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
has O
revolutionalized O
the O
field O
by O
allowing O
the O
rapid O
and O
sensitive O
analysis O
of O
acylcarnitines. B-Chemical
Equally O
important O
is O
that O
much O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
development O
of O
specific O
enzyme O
assays O
to O
identify O
the O
enzyme O
defect O
in O
patients B-Species
subsequently O
followed O
by O
genetic O
analysis. O
In O
this O
review, O
we O
will O
describe O
the O
current O
state O
of O
knowledge O
in O
the O
field O
of O
fatty B-Chemical

oxidation O
enzymology O
and O
its O
application O
to O
the O
follow-up O

of O
