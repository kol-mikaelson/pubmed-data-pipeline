# Abstract
Pantetheinase B-Gene
is O
an O
amidohydrolase O
involved O
in O
the O
dissimilative O
pathway O
of O
CoA, B-Chemical
allowing O
the O
turnover O
of O
the O
pantothenate B-Chemical
moiety. O
We O
have O
determined O
the O
N-terminal O
sequence O
as O
well O
as O
the O
sequences O
of O
a O
number O
of O
tryptic O
and O
chymotryptic O
peptides O
of O
the O
protein O
isolated O
from O
pig B-Species
kidney. O
These O
sequence O
stretches O
were O
used O
as O
probes O
to O
search O
in O
the O
SwissProt O
database O
and O
significant O
similarities O
were O
found O
with O
a O
GPI-anchored O
protein O
(mouse B-Species
vanin-1, B-Gene
with O
a O
suggested O
role O
in O
lymphocyte O
migration), O
with O
two O
putative O
proteins O
encoded O
by O
human B-Species
cDNAs O
(VNN1 B-Gene
and O
VNN2) B-Gene
and O
with O
human B-Species
biotinidase. B-Gene
On O
the O
basis O
of O
sequence O
similarity, O
we O
propose O
that O
vanin-1 B-Gene
and O
VNN1 B-Gene
should O
be O
identified O
as O
pantetheinase. B-Gene
