# Abstract
We O
have O
identified O
in O
plasma O
membrane O
fractions O
isolated O
from O
rat B-Species
hepatocarcinoma B-Disease
AS-30D B-CellLine
ascites O
cells O
three O
glycoproteins O
of O
125 O
kDa, O
115 O
kDa O
and O
105 O
kDa O
(gp125, O
gp115 O
and O
gp105) O
which O
become O
adenylylated O
using O
ATP B-Chemical
as O
substrate, O
most O
readily O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
EDTA. B-Chemical
The O
gp115 O
becomes O
also O
phosphorylated. O
The O
adenylylation O
of O
these O
tumor B-Disease
glycoproteins I-Disease
was O
much O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
a O
group O
of O
analogous O
adenylylatable O
glycoproteins O
(gp130, B-Gene
gp120-gp110 O
dimer O
and O
gp100) B-Gene
present O
in O
normal O
rat B-Species
liver O
plasma O
membrane. O
The O
tumor B-Disease
glycoproteins I-Disease
were O
reversibly O
O-adenylylated O
at O
threonine O
residues, O
as O
was O
the O
case O
for O
their O
normal O
rat B-Species
liver O
counterparts. O
The O
tumor B-Disease
gp115, O
and O
the O
gp120-gp110 O
dimer O
from O
normal O
rat B-Species
liver O
were O
both O
isolated O
using O
either O
ATP-affinity O
chromatography O
and O
or O
AMP-affinity O
chromatography. O
The O
gp120-gp110 O
dimer O
from O
normal O
rat B-Species
liver O
was O
identified O
as O
the O
plasma O
cell O
differentiation O
antigen-1 O
(PC-1 B-Gene
protein), O
an O
ecto-5' O
phosphodiesterase O
nucleotide-pyrophosphatase O
(5'-PDE O
NPPase). O
The O
gp115 O
from O
tumor B-Disease
cells O
also O
exhibited O
Zn2+-stimulated O
5'-PDE O
and O
NPPase O
activities O
in O
alkaline O
conditions, O
although O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
distinct O
from O
the O
PC-1 B-Gene
protein. O
We O
have O
determined O
that O
the O
gp115 O
is O
an O
ecto-enzyme O
that O
catalyzes O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
extracellular O
ATP, B-Chemical
since O
its O
adenylylation O
and O
phosphorylation O
were O
detected O
in O
intact O
cells O
using O
extracellularly O
added O
[alpha-32P]ATP B-Chemical
or O
[gamma-32P]ATP, B-Chemical
respectively, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
permeabilizing O
agent. O
