# Abstract
1. O
An O
emulsion O
preparation O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
was O
administered O
locally O
to O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
small O
and O
large O
intestine O
by O
gavage: O
to O
the O
duodenum O
(opposite O
to O
the O
papilla O
of O
Vater), O
jejunum O
(150 O
cm O
distal O
to O
the O
teeth), O
ileum O
(300 O
cm O
distal O
to O
the O
teeth), O
and O
to O
the O
colon O
descendens O
(30 O
cm O
proximal O
to O
the O
anus). O
2. O
The O
bioavailability O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
after O
these O
instillations O
was O
compared O
with O
that O
after O
oral O
administration O
of O
a O
hard O
gelatine O
capsule O
formulation. O
3. O
Cyclosporin B-Chemical
was O
found O
to O
be O
absorbed O
predominantly O
in O
the O
small O
intestine. O
This O
may O
have O
implications O
for O
dosage O
in O
patients O
with O
reduced O
absorptive O
surface O
area. O
