# Abstract
This O
article O
provides O
an O
update O
about O
catecholamine B-Chemical
metabolism, O
with O
emphasis O
on O
correcting O
common O
misconceptions O
relevant O
to O
catecholamine B-Chemical
systems O
in O
health O
and O
disease. O
Importantly, O
most O
metabolism O
of O
catecholamines B-Chemical
takes O
place O
within O
the O
same O
cells O
where O
the O
amines B-Chemical
are O
synthesized. O
This O
mainly O
occurs O
secondary O
to O
leakage O
of O
catecholamines B-Chemical
from O
vesicular O
stores O
into O
the O
cytoplasm. O
These O
stores O
exist O
in O
a O
highly O
dynamic O
equilibrium, O
with O
passive O
outward O
leakage O
counterbalanced O
by O
inward O
active O
transport O
controlled O
by O
vesicular O
monoamine B-Chemical
transporters. O
In O
catecholaminergic O
neurons, O
the O
presence O
of O
monoamine B-Chemical
oxidase O
leads O
to O
formation O
of O
reactive O
catecholaldehydes. B-Chemical
Production O
of O
these O
toxic O
aldehydes B-Chemical
depends O
on O
the O
dynamics O
of O
vesicular-axoplasmic O
monoamine B-Chemical
exchange O
and O
enzyme-catalyzed O
conversion O
to O
nontoxic O
acids O
or O
alcohols. B-Chemical
In O
sympathetic O
nerves, O
the O
aldehyde B-Chemical
produced O
from O
norepinephrine B-Chemical
is O
converted O
to O
3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, B-Chemical
not O
3,4-dihydroxymandelic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Subsequent O
extraneuronal O
O-methylation O
consequently O
leads O
to O
production O
of O
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, B-Chemical
not O
vanillylmandelic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Vanillylmandelic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
instead O
formed O
in O
the O
liver O
by O
oxidation O
of O
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol B-Chemical
catalyzed O
by O
alcohol O
and O
aldehyde B-Chemical
dehydrogenases. O
Compared O
to O
intraneuronal O
deamination, O
extraneuronal O
O-methylation O
of O
norepinephrine B-Chemical
and O
epinephrine B-Chemical
to O
metanephrines B-Chemical
represent O
minor O
pathways O
of O
metabolism. O
The O
single O
largest O
source O
of O
metanephrines B-Chemical
is O
the O
adrenal O
medulla. O
Similarly, O
pheochromocytoma B-Disease
tumor I-Disease
cells O
produce O
large O
amounts O
of O
metanephrines B-Chemical
from O
catecholamines B-Chemical
leaking O
from O
stores. O
Thus, O
these O
metabolites O
are O
particularly O
useful O
for O
detecting O
pheochromocytomas. B-Disease
The O
large O
contribution O
of O
intraneuronal O
deamination O
to O
catecholamine B-Chemical
turnover, O
and O
dependence O
of O
this O
on O
the O
vesicular-axoplasmic O
monoamine B-Chemical
exchange O
process, O
helps O
explain O
how O
synthesis, O
release, O
metabolism, O
turnover, O
and O
stores O
of O
catecholamines B-Chemical
are O
regulated O
in O
a O
coordinated O
fashion O
during O
stress O
and O
in O
disease O
states. O
