# Abstract
Beta-oxidation O

mammalian O
peroxisomes O
can O
occur O
via O
either O
multifunctional O

2 O
(MFE-2), B-Gene
both O

which O
catalyze O
the O
hydration O
of O
trans-2-enoyl-CoA B-Chemical
and O
the O
dehydrogenation O
of O
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, B-Chemical

To O

their O
potential O

in O
catalysis, O
each O
residue O
was O
replaced O
by O
alanine O
in O
site-directed O
mutagenesis, O
and O
the O
resulting O

were O
tested O

After O
additional O
screening, O
the O
wild O
type O
and O
noncomplementing O
E366A B-ProteinMutation
and O
D510A B-ProteinMutation
variants O
were O
expressed O
and O
characterized. O
The O
purified O

have O
similar O
secondary O

elements, O
with O
the O

The O
E366A B-ProteinMutation
variant O
had O
a O

100 O
times O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
the O

inactive. O
Asp-510 O

a O
novel O
hydratase O

motif O
found O
in O
the O
hydratase O

proteins. O
The O
data O
show O
that O
the O
hydratase O

reaction O
catalyzed O
by O
MFE-2 B-Gene
requires O
two O
protic O
residues, O
Glu-366 O
and O
Asp-510, O
suggesting O
that O
their O
catalytic O
role O
may O
be O
equivalent O
to O
that O
