# Abstract
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
determine O
the O
levels O
of O
blood O
spot O
carnitine B-Chemical
and O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
in O
children O
aged O
0-15 O
years O
by O
tandem O
mass O

offer O
basic O
data O
for O
evaluating O

nutritional O
status O
and O
diagnosing O
metabolic B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
of O

METHODS: O
The O
concentration O
of O
carnitine B-Chemical
and O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
were O
measured O
in O
blood O
spot O
by O
tandem O
mass O

using O
underivatized O
samples. O
The O
samples O
included O
those O

1 O
year O
and O
401 O

15 O
years. O
A O
few O

were O
involved O
in O

Other O
samples O
were O
taken O
from O
mainly O
outdoor O
patients B-Species
for O
little O

preoperative O
examination. O
Patients B-Species
suffering O
from O
fever, B-Disease

were O
excluded O
from O
this O
study. O
