# Abstract
Uridine-cytidine O
kinases O
(UCK) O
have O
important O
roles O
for O
the O
phosphorylation O
of O
nucleoside B-Chemical
analogs O
that O
are O
being O
investigated O
for O
possible O
use O
in O
chemotherapy O
of O
cancer. B-Disease
We O
have O
cloned O
the O
cDNA O
of O
two O
human B-Species
UCKs. O
The O
approximately O
30-kDa O
proteins, O
named O
UCK1 B-Gene
and O
UCK2, B-Gene
were O
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
shown O
to O
catalyze O
the O
phosphorylation O
of O
Urd B-Chemical
and O
Cyd. B-Chemical
The O
enzymes O
did O
not O
phosphorylate O
deoxyribonucleosides B-Chemical
or O
purine B-Chemical
ribonucleosides. I-Chemical
UCK1 B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
detected O
as O
two O
isoforms O
of O
approximately O
1.8 O
and O
approximately O
2.7 O
kb. O
The O
2.7-kb O
band O
was O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
in O
the O
investigated O
tissues. O
The O
band O
of O
approximately O
1.8 O
kb O
was O
present O
in O
skeletal O
muscle, O
heart, O
liver, O
and O
kidney. O
The O
two O
isoforms O
of O
UCK2 B-Gene
mRNA O
of O
1.2 O
and O
2.0 O
kb O
were O
only O
detected O
in O
placenta O
among O
the O
investigated O
tissues. O
The O
genes O
encoding O
UCK1 B-Gene
and O
UCK2 B-Gene
were O
mapped O
to O
chromosome O
9q34.2-9q34.3 O
and O
1q22-1q23.2, O
respectively. O
We O
tested O
28 O
cytidine B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
uridine I-Chemical
nucleoside I-Chemical
analogs O
as O
possible O
substrates O
of O
the O
enzymes. O
The O
enzymes O
phosphorylated O

such O
as O
6-azauridine, B-Chemical
5-fluorouridine, B-Chemical
4-thiouridine, B-Chemical

N(4)-acetylcytidine, B-Chemical
N(4)-benzoylcytidine, B-Chemical
5-fluorocytidine, B-Chemical

N(4)-anisoylcytidine. B-Chemical
The O
cloning O

will O
be O
important O
for O
development O
of O
novel O
pyrimidine B-Chemical
