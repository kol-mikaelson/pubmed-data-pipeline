# Abstract
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase O
(UGT) O
enzymes O
belonging O
to O
the O
UGT2B O
subfamily O
catalyze O
the O
transfer O
of O
glucuronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
a O
large O
number O
of O
endogenous O
compounds, O
particularly O
steroids, B-Chemical
to O
facilitate O
their O
elimination O
from O
target O
cells. O
A O
novel O
human B-Species
UGT2B O
cDNA O
of O
1666 O
bp O
was O
isolated O
and O
encodes O
a O
529-amino O
acid O
protein O
named O
UGT2B28 B-Gene
type O
I. O
Glucuronidation O
assays O
demonstrated O
that O
UGT2B28 B-Gene
type O
I O
catalyzes O
the O
conjugation O
of O
endogenous O
and O
exogenous O
compounds. O
The O
tissue O
distribution O
of O
UGT2B28 B-Gene
revealed O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
type O
I O
transcript O
in O
the O
liver, O
breast, O
and O
LNCaP B-CellLine
cells. O
Two O
other O
UGT2B O
cDNAs O
were O
isolated, O
and O
sequence O
analysis O
led O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
two O
truncated O
UGT2B28 B-Gene
species. O
UGT2B28 B-Gene
type O
II O
differs O
from O
type O
I O
by O
a O
deletion O
of O
308 O
bp O
in O
the O
cofactor O
binding O
domain, O
whereas O
UGT2B28 B-Gene
type O
III O
lacks O
351 O
bp O
in O
the O
putative O
substrate O
binding O
domain. O
All O
UGT2B28 B-Gene
isoforms O
are O
encoded O
by O
a O
single O
UGT2B28 B-Gene
gene O
which O
has O
a O
genomic O
organization O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
the O
other O
UGT2B O
genes O
characterized O
thus O
far. O
Although O
no O
substrates O
could O
be O
identified O
for O
the O
shorter O
isoforms, O
the O
three O
subtypes O
were O
shown O
to O
be O
located O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
and O
the O
perinuclear O
membrane, O
demonstrating O
that O
the O
missing O
domains O
are O
not O
required O
for O
the O
subcellular O
localization O
of O
these O
UGT2B O
proteins. O
However, O
all O
the O
domains O
remain O
necessary O
for O
observing O
glucuronidation O
activity. O
The O
expression O
of O
UGT2B28 B-Gene
type O
I O
in O
the O
breast O
and O
liver O
suggests O
a O
role O
of O
this O
enzyme O
in O
the O
androgen O
and O
estrogen O
metabolism O
in O
these O
tissues. O
