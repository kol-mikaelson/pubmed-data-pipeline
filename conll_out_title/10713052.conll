# Abstract
Venom O
and O
mammalian O
secreted O
phospholipases O
A(2) O
(sPLA(2)s) O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
numerous O
physiological, O
pathological, O
and O
toxic O
processes. O
So O
far, O
structurally O
related O
group O
I O
and O
II O
sPLA(2)s O
have O
been O
found O
in O
vertebrates O
such O
as O
mammals O
and O
snakes, O
whereas O
group O
III O
sPLA(2)s O
have O
mainly O
been O
found O
in O
venom O
from O
invertebrates O
such O
as O
bees B-Species
and O
scorpions. B-Species
Here O
we O
report O
the O
cloning O
and O
expression O
of O
a O
cDNA O
coding O
for O
a O
human B-Species
group O
III O
(hGIII) O
sPLA(2). B-Gene
The O
full-length O
cDNA O
codes O
for O
a O
signal O
peptide O
of O
19 O
residues O
followed O
by O
a O
protein O
of O
490 O

a O
central O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
domain O
(141 O
residues) O
flanked O
by O
large O
N- O
and O
C-terminal O
regions O
(130 O
and O
219 O
residues, O
respectively). O
The O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
domain O
is O
31% O
identical O
to O
bee O
venom O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
and O
displays O
all O
of O
the O
features O
of O
group O
III O
sPLA(2)s O
including O
10 O
cysteines. O
The O
hGIII O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
gene O
consists O
of O
at O
least O
7 O
exons O
and O
maps O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
22q. I-Chromosome
By O
Northern O

analysis, O
a O
4.4-kilobase O
hGIII O
transcript O
was O
found O
in O
kidney, O
heart, O
liver, O
and O
skeletal O
muscle. O
Transfection O
of O
hGIII O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
cDNA O
in O
COS B-CellLine
cells O
led O
to O
accumulation O
of O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
activity O
in O
the O
culture O
medium, O
indicating O
that O
the O
cDNA O
codes O
for O
a O
secreted O
enzyme. O
Using O
small O
unilamellar O
vesicles O
as O
substrate, O
hGIII O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
was O
found O
to O
be O
a O
Ca(2+)-dependent O
enzyme O
showing O
an O
11-fold O
preference O
for O
phosphatidylglycerol O
over O
phosphatidylcholine O
