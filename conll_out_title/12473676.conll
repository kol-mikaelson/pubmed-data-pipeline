# Abstract
Carnosine O
(beta-alanyl-L-histidine) O
and O
homocarnosine O
(gamma-aminobutyric B-Chemical
acid-L-histidine) I-Chemical
are O
two O
naturally O
occurring O
dipeptides B-Chemical
with O
potential O
neuroprotective O
and O
neurotransmitter O
functions O
in O
the O
brain. O
Peptidase O
activities O
degrading O
both O
carnosine O
and O
homocarnosine O
have O
been O
described O
previously, O
but O
the O
genes O
linked O
to O
these O
activities O
were O
unknown. O
Here O
we O
present O
the O
identification O
of O
two O
novel O
cDNAs O
named O
CN1 B-Gene
and O
CN2 B-Gene
coding O
for O
two O
proteins O
of O
56.8 O
and O
52.7 O
kDa O
and O
their O
classification O
as O
members O
of O
the O
M20 O
metalloprotease O
family. O
Whereas O
human B-Species
CN1 B-Gene
mRNA O
and O
protein O
are O
brain-specific, O
CN2 B-Gene
codes O
for O
a O
ubiquitous O
protein. O
In O
contrast, O
expression O
of O
the O
mouse B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
CN1 B-Gene
orthologues O
was O
detectable O
only O
in O
kidney. O
The O
recombinant O
CN1 B-Gene
and O
CN2 B-Gene
proteins O
were O
expressed O
in O
Chinese B-CellLine
hamster I-CellLine
ovary I-CellLine
cells O
and O
purified O
to O
homogeneity. O
CN1 B-Gene
was O
identified O
as O
a O
homodimeric O
dipeptidase O
with O
a O
narrow O
substrate O

Xaa-His B-Chemical

CN2 B-Gene
protein O
is O
a O
dipeptidase O
not O

to O
Xaa-His B-Chemical
dipeptides, I-Chemical
requires O
Mn(2+) B-Chemical

This O

does O
not O
degrade O
homocarnosine O
and O
hydrolyzes O
carnosine O
only O
at O
alkaline O
pH O
with O
an O

Based O
on O

biophysical O

CN1 B-Gene
was O
identified O
as O
human B-Species
carnosinase O
(EC O

whereas O
CN2 B-Gene
corresponds O
to O
the O
