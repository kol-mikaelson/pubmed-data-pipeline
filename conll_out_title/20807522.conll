# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
based O
newborn O
screening O
programs O
(NBS) O
allow O
early O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
for O
a O
number O
of O
inborn B-Disease
metabolic I-Disease
disorders. I-Disease
Despite O
the O
improved O
prognosis O
of O
affected O
individuals, O
the O
knowledge O
regarding O
the O
potential O
risks O
of O
childbearing O
in O
many O
of O
these O
conditions O
remains O
limited. O
Newborns O
with O
isovaleric B-Disease
acidemia I-Disease
(IVA) B-Disease
have O
been O
diagnosed O
by O
NBS O
and O
most O
of O
them O
can O
thrive O
and O
develop O
normally. O
Many O
affected O
individuals O
will O
therefore O
reach O
childbearing O
age O
in O
the O
near O
future. O
The O
information O
about O
maternal O
IVA, B-Disease
however, O
is O
quite O
limited. O
CASE O
REPORT: O
Close O
observation O
of O
plasma O
amino O
acid, O
carnitine, B-Chemical
and O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
profiles O
was O
performed O
in O
a O
patient B-Species
with O
IVA B-Disease
that O
completed O
uneventful O
pregnancy. O
Plasma O
isovalerylcarnitine B-Chemical
level O
was O
drastically O
decreased O
from O
the O
second O
trimester O
and O
free O
carnitine B-Chemical
was O
inversely O
increased, O
suggesting O
reduced O
production O
of O
isovaleryl-CoA. B-Chemical
This O
decrease O
of O
isovaleryl-CoA B-Chemical
production O
was O
likely O
due O
to O
reduced O
leucine B-Chemical
metabolism, O
secondary O
to O
the O
enhanced O
fetal O
anabolism O
associated O
with O
the O
rapid O
fetal O
growth O
of O
the O
second O
and O
the O
third O
trimesters. O
A O
decrease O
in O
maternal O
essential B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
including O
leucine B-Chemical
was O
observed O
during O
the O
second O
and O
the O
third O
trimesters. O
CONCLUSION: O
This O
observation O
revealed O
distinctive O
metabolic O
profiles O
during O
pregnancy O
in O
a O
patient B-Species
with O
IVA B-Disease
and O
supports O
close O
laboratory O
monitoring O
and O
diet O
management O
for O
successful O
pregnancy. O
