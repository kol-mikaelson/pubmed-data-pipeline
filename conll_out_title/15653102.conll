# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Carnitine B-Disease
palmitoyltransferase-II I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
(CPT-II B-Disease
deficiency) I-Disease
is O
a O
rare O
disorder B-Disease
of I-Disease
lipid I-Disease
metabolism, I-Disease
in O
which O
the O
accumulation O
of O
long-chain B-Chemical
acylcarnitines I-Chemical
is O
a O
diagnostic O
marker. O
HPLC O
with O
fluorescence O

is O
an O
attractive O

method O
due O
to O
its O
favorable O
combination O
of O
sensitivity, O

METHODS: O
Long-chain B-Chemical
acylcarnitines I-Chemical
were O
isolated O
from O
tissue O
homogenates O
(0.5-2 O
mg O
wet O

or O
plasma O
(50 O

using O
silica B-Chemical
gel O

and O
derivatized O
with O
2-(2,3-naphthalimino)ethyl B-Chemical
trifluoromethanesulfonate. I-Chemical
Quantitation O
was O
by O
HPLC O
and O
fluorescence O
detection O
with O
standard O

for O
myristoyl-, B-Chemical

palmitoyl-, I-Chemical
oleoyl- I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
stearoylcarnitine B-Chemical
using O
heptadecanoylcarnitine B-Chemical
as O
the O
internal O
standard. O
RESULTS: O
Significantly O
greater O
amounts O
of O
long-chain B-Chemical
acylcarnitines I-Chemical
were O
quantified O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
CPT-II B-Disease

when O
compared O
to O
controls; O
e.g. O
(nmol O

myristoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(0.3, O

palmitoleoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(0.5, O

stearoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(0.4, O

CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
method O
can O
be O
used O
to O
quantitate O
long-chain B-Chemical
acylcarnitines, I-Chemical
illustrating O
their O
accumulation O
in O
CPT-II B-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
The O
analysis O
was O
accomplished O
using O
inexpensive O
and O
widely O
available O
instrumentation O
and O
is O
appropriate O
for O
research O
investigators O
who O
require O
precise O
quantitation O
of O
long-chain B-Chemical
