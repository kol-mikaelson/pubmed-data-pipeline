# Abstract
Organic O
anion O
transporting O
polypeptide O
(oatp1) B-Gene
has O
been O
cloned O
from O
rat B-Species
liver O
as O
one O
of O
the O
transporters O
responsible O
for O
the O
hepatic O
uptake O
of O
ligands, O
and O
its O
substrate O
specificity O
has O
been O
determined. O
However, O
the O
contribution O
of O
oatp1 B-Gene
to O
the O
Na+-independent O
uptake O
of O
ligands O
into O
rat B-Species
hepatocytes O
remains O
to O
be O
investigated. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
determined O
the O
contribution O
of O
oatp1 B-Gene
and O
examined O
the O
uptake O
of O
ligands O
into O
primary O
cultured O
hepatocytes O
(cultured O
for O
4 O
h) O
and O
into O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells O
transiently O
expressing O
oatp1 B-Gene
and O
normalized O
using O
estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide B-Chemical
as O
a O
reference O
compound. O
Western O
blot O
analysis O
indicated O
that O
oatp1 B-Gene
was O
less O
extensively O
glycosylated O
in O
transfected O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells, O
and O
the O
expression O
level O
in O
transfectant O
was O
one-seventh O
that O
in O
rat B-Species
liver. O
The O
Km O
values O
for O
the O
uptake O
of O
estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide B-Chemical
were O
similar O
for O
cultured O
hepatocytes O
and O
oatp1-transfected O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells O
(Km O
= O
12.3 O
versus O
20.4 O
microM), O
although O
the O
Vmax O
value O
for O
oatp1-transfected O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
one-seventh O
that O
for O
cultured O
hepatocytes O
(Vmax O
= O
1.30 O
versus O
0.175 O
nmol O
min O
mg O
protein). O
The O
contribution O
of O
oatp1 B-Gene
to O
the O
Na+-independent O
uptake O
of O
taurocholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
cholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
into O
rat B-Species
hepatocytes O
was O
more O
than O
50 O
to O
60%, O
whereas O
the O
corresponding O
values O
for O
the O
sulfate-conjugates O
of O
estrone B-Chemical
and O
6-hydroxy-5, B-Chemical
7-dimethyl-2-methylamino-4-(3-pyridylmethyl)benzothiazole I-Chemical
were O
20 O
to O
30%. O
In O
addition, O
the O
analysis O
indicated O
that O
the O
contribution O
of O
oatp1 B-Gene
to O
the O
Na+-independent O
uptake O
of O
several O
ligands O
[glucuronide-conjugate O
of O
6-hydroxy-5, B-Chemical
7-dimethyl2-methylamino-4-(3-pyridylmethyl)benzothiazole, I-Chemical
ibuprofen, B-Chemical
pravastatin, B-Chemical
ouabain, B-Chemical
and O
2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione] B-Chemical
was O
minimal. O
Collectively, O
the O
transfected O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells O
may O
be O
used O
to O
quantitatively O
predict O
oatp1 B-Gene
activity O
in O
hepatocytes O
after O
correction O
of O
its O
expressed O
amount. O
It O
is O
also O
suggested O
that O
multiple O
transport O
mechanisms O
are O
responsible O
for O
the O
Na+-independent O
uptake O
of O
organic B-Chemical
anions I-Chemical
into O
hepatocytes. O
