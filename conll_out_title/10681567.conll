# Abstract
Mammalian O
secretory O
phospholipase O
A(2)s O
(sPLA(2)s) O
form O
a O
family O
of O
structurally O
related O
enzymes O
that O
are O
involved O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
physiological O
and O
pathological O
processes O
via O
the O
release O
of O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
from O
membrane O
phospholipids B-Chemical
or O
the O
binding O
to O
specific O
membrane O
receptors. O
Here, O
we O
report O
the O
cloning O
and O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
that O
is O
the O
sixth O
isoform O
of O
the O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
family O
found O
in O
humans. B-Species
The O
novel O
human B-Species
mature O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
consists O
of O
123 O
amino O
acids O
(M(r) O
= O
14,000) O
and O
is O
most O
similar O
to O
group O
IIA O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
(sPLA(2)-IIA) O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
number O
and O
positions O
of O
cysteine O
residues O
as O
well O
as O
overall O
identity O
(51%). O
Therefore, O
this O
novel O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
should O
be O
categorized O
into O
group O
II O
and O
called O
group O
IIE O
(sPLA(2)-IIE) B-Gene
following O
the O
recently O
identified O
group O
IID O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
(sPLA(2)-IID). B-Gene
The O
enzymatic O
properties O
of O
recombinant O
human B-Species
sPLA(2)-IIE B-Gene
were O
almost O
identical O
to O
those O
of O
sPLA(2)-IIA B-Gene
and I-Gene
IID I-Gene
in O
terms O
of O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
requirement, O

as O
well O
as O

Along O
with O
the O
biochemical O
properties O
of O
proteins, O
genetic O
and O
evolutional O
similarities O
were O
also O
observed O
among O
these O
three O
types O
of O
group O
II O
sPLA(2)s O
as O
to O
the O
chromosomal O
location O
of O
the O
human B-Species
gene O
(1p36) B-Chromosome
and O

organization. O
The O
expression O
of O
sPLA(2)-IIE B-Gene
transcripts O
in O
humans B-Species
was O
restricted O
to O
the O
brain, O
heart, O
lung, O
and O
placenta O
in O
contrast O
to O
broad O
expression O
profiles O
for O
sPLA(2)-IIA B-Gene
and I-Gene
-IID. I-Gene
In O
sPLA(2)-IIA-deficient O
mice, B-Species
the O
expression O
of O
sPLA(2)-IIE B-Gene
was O
markedly O
enhanced O
in O
the O
lung O
and O
small O
intestine O
upon O
endotoxin O
challenge, O
which O
contrasted O
with O
the O
reduced O
expression O
of O
sPLA(2)-IID B-Gene
mRNA. O
In O
situ O
hybridization O
analysis O
revealed O
elevation O
of O
sPLA(2)-IIE B-Gene
mRNA O
at O
alveolar O
macrophage-like O
cells O
in O
the O
lung O
of O
endotoxin-treated O
mice. B-Species
These O
findings O
suggest O
a O
distinct O
functional O
role O
of O
novel O
sPLA(2)-IIE B-Gene
in O
the O
progression O
of O
inflammatory O
processes. O
