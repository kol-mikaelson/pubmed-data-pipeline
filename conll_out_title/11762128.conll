# Abstract
The O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
alcohol B-Chemical
determines O
the O
time O
course O
of O
alcohol B-Chemical
concentration O
in O
blood O
after O
the O
ingestion O
of O
an O
alcoholic O
beverage O
and O
the O
degree O
of O
exposure O
of O
organs O
to O
its O
effects. O
The O
interplay O
between O
the O
kinetics O
of O
absorption, O
distribution O
and O
elimination O
is O
thus O
important O
in O
determining O
the O
pharmacodynamic O
responses O
to O
alcohol. B-Chemical
There O
is O
a O
large O
degree O
of O
variability O
in O
alcohol B-Chemical
absorption, O
distribution O
and O
metabolism, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
both O
genetic O
and O
environmental O
factors. O
The O
between-individual O
variation O
in O
alcohol B-Chemical
metabolic O
rates O
is, O
in O
part O
due O
to O
allelic O
variants O
of O
the O
genes O
encoding O
the O
alcohol B-Chemical
metabolizing O
enzymes, O
alcohol B-Chemical
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(ADH) B-Gene
and O
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
(ALDH). O
This O
review O
summarizes O
recent O
developments O
in O
the O
investigation O
of O
the O
following O
influences O
on O
alcohol B-Chemical
elimination O
rate: O
gender, O
body O
composition O
and O
lean O
body O
mass, O
liver O
volume, O
food O
and O
food O
composition, O
ethnicity, O
and O
genetic O
polymorphisms O
in O
alcohol B-Chemical
metabolizing O
enzymes O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
promoter O
regions O
of O
the O
genes O
for O
these O
enzymes. O
Evaluation O
of O
the O
factors O
regulating O
the O
rates O
of O
alcohol B-Chemical
and O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
metabolism, O
both O
genetic O
and O
environmental, O
will O
help O
not O
only O
to O
explain O
the O
risk O
for O
development O
of O
alcoholism, B-Disease
but O
also O
the O
risk O
for O
development O
of O
alcohol-related O
organ B-Disease
