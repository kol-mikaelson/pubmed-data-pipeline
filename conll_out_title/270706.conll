# Abstract
The O
activity O
of O
the O
enzyme O
porphobilinogen B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
(EC O
4.2.1.24) O
in O
erythrocytes O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia I-Disease
was O
less O
than O
5% O
of O
that O
in O
a O
control O
group O
and O
the O
activity O
in O
liver O
tissue O
was O
less O
than O
1% O
of O
the O
reported O
normal O
activity. O
Urine O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia I-Disease
contained O
an O
inhibitor O
that O
was O
isolated O
and O
identified O
as O
succinylacetone B-Chemical
(4,6-dioxoheptanoic B-Chemical
acid) I-Chemical
by O
gas O
liquid O
chromatography-mass O
spectrometry. O
Fresh O
urine O
samples O
contained O
succinylacetoacetate B-Chemical
(3,5-dioxooctanedioic B-Chemical
acid) I-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
succinylacetone. B-Chemical
The O
inhibition O
of O
porphobilinogen B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
explains O
the O
high O
excretion O
of O
5-aminolevulinate B-Chemical
observed O
in O
hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia. I-Disease
Succinylacetone B-Chemical
and O
succinylacetoacetate B-Chemical
presumably O
originate O
from O
maleylacetoacetate B-Chemical
or O
fumarylacetoacetate, B-Chemical
or O
both, O
and O
their O
accumulation O
indicates O
a O
block O
at O
the O
fumarylacetoacetase B-Gene
(EC O
3.7.1.2) O
step O
in O
the O
degradation O
of O
tyrosine. B-Chemical
We O
suggest O
that O
the O
severe O
liver B-Disease
and I-Disease
kidney I-Disease
damage I-Disease
in O
hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia I-Disease
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
accumulation O
of O
these O
tyrosine B-Chemical
metabolites O
and O
that O
the O
primary O
enzyme O
defect O
in O
hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia I-Disease
may O
be O
decreased O
activity O
of O
fumarylacetoacetase. B-Gene
