# Abstract
A O
soluble O
aminopeptidase B-Gene
distinct O
from O
two O
enzymes O
described O
previously O
was O
isolated O
from O
human B-Species
placenta O
and O
some O
of O
its O
properties O
were O
investigated. O
The O
three O
aminopeptidases O
were O
separated O
by O
DEAE-cellulose O
chromatography. O
The O
newly O
found O
aminopeptidase B-Gene
exhibits O
specific O
hydrolysis O
of O
leucine O
derivatives O
among O
various O
synthetic O
substrates. O
However, O
a O
broad O
substrate O
specificity O
was O
observed O
toward O
some O
natural O
bioactive O
peptides. O
