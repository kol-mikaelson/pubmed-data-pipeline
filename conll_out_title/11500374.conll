# Abstract
Inositol B-Chemical
and O
its O
phosphorylated O
derivatives O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
brain O
function, O
either O
as O
osmolytes, O
second O
messengers O
or O
regulators O
of O
vesicle O
endo- O
and O
exocytosis. O
Here O
we O
describe O
the O
identification O
and O
functional O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
H(+)-myo- B-Gene
inositol I-Gene
co-transporter, I-Gene
HMIT, B-Gene
expressed O
predominantly O
in O
the O
brain. O
HMIT B-Gene
cDNA O
encodes O
a O
618 O
amino O
acid O
polypeptide O
with O
12 O
predicted O
transmembrane O
domains. O
Functional O
expression O
of O
HMIT B-Gene
in O
Xenopus B-Species
oocytes O
showed O
that O
transport O
activity O
was O
specific O
for O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
and O
related O
stereoisomers O
with O
a O
Michaelis-Menten O
constant O
of O
approximately O
100 O
microM, O
and O
that O
transport O
activity O
was O
strongly O
stimulated O
by O
decreasing O
pH. O
Electrophysiological O
measurements O
revealed O
that O
transport O
was O
electrogenic O
with O
a O
maximal O
transport O
activity O
reached O
at O
pH O
5.0. O
In O
rat B-Species
brain O
membrane O
preparations, O
HMIT B-Gene
appeared O
as O
a O
75-90 O
kDa O
protein O
that O
could O
be O
converted O
to O
a O
67 O
kDa O
band O
upon O
enzymatic O
deglycosylation. O
Immunofluorescence O
microscopy O
analysis O
showed O
HMIT B-Gene
expression O
in O
glial O
cells O
and O
some O
neurons. O
These O
data O
provide O
the O
first O
characterization O
of O
a O
mammalian O
H(+)-coupled O
myo- O
inositol B-Chemical
transporter. O
Predominant O
central O
expression O
of O
HMIT B-Gene
suggests O
that O
it O
has O
a O
key O
role O
in O
the O
control O
of O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
brain O
metabolism. O
