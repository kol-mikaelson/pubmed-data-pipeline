# Abstract
1. O
Cyclosporine B-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolites, O
isolated O
from O
human B-Species
bile O
and O
identified O
by O
FAB B-Chemical
mass O
spectrometry O
and O
1H-n.m.r. O
spectroscopy, O
were O
metabolized O
by O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
new O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolites. O
From O
these O
data O
a O
metabolic O
pathway O
for O
cyclosporine, B-Chemical
which O
includes O
these O
new O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolites, O
has O
been O
proposed. O
The O
new O
metabolites O
were O
isolated O
by O
semi-preparative O
h.p.l.c. O
and O
their O
chemical O
structures O
were O
elucidated O
by O
FAB B-Chemical
mass O
spectrometry. O
These O
isolated O
metabolites O
were O
further O
metabolized O
and O
the O
products O
identified O
by O
FAB B-Chemical
mass O
spectrometry. O
2. O
Fourteen O
metabolites, O
whose O
structure O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
elucidated, O
were O
isolated O
after O
metabolism O
of O
structurally O
identified O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolites, O
and O
chemical O
structures O
for O
five O
of O
these O
metabolites O
were O
proposed. O
3. O
The O
structures O
of O
the O
new O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolites O
were: O
(i) O
a O
N-demethylated, O
carboxylated O
derivative O
(AM1A4N), B-Chemical
(ii) O
a O
di-hydroxylated, O
N-demethylated O
derivative O
(AM14N9), B-Chemical
(iii) O
a O
hydroxylated O
and O
carboxylated O
derivative O
(AM1A9), B-Chemical
(iv) O
a O
di-hydroxylated, O
cyclized O
and O
N-demethylated O
derivative O
(AM1c4N9) O
and O
(v) O
a O
cyclized O
and O
carboxylated O
(AM1cA) O
derivative. O
4. O
A O
proposed O
cyclosporine B-Chemical
metabolic O
pathway O
comprises O
a O
total O
of O
29 O
metabolites. O
It O
consists O
of O
four O
main O
branches O
originating O
from O
metabolites O
AM1, O
AM1c, O
AM9 O
and O
AM4N. O
