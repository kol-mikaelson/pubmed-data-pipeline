# Abstract
Losartan B-Chemical
is O
the O
first O
orally O
available O
angiotensin-receptor O
antagonist O
without O
agonist O
properties. O
Following O
oral O
administration, O
losartan B-Chemical
is O
rapidly O
absorbed, O
reaching O
maximum O
concentrations O
1-2 O
hours O
post-administration. O
After O
oral O
administration O
approximately O
14% O
of O
a O
losartan B-Chemical
dose O
is O
converted O
to O
the O
pharmacologically O
active O
E B-Chemical
3174 I-Chemical
metabolite. O
E B-Chemical
3174 I-Chemical
is O
10- O
to O
40-fold O
more O
potent O
than O
its O
parent O
compound O
and O
its O
estimated O
terminal O
half-life O
ranges O
from O
6 O
to O
9 O
hours. O
The O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
and O
E B-Chemical
3174 I-Chemical
are O
linear, O
dose-proportional O
and O
do O
not O
substantially O
change O
with O
repetitive O
administration. O
The O
recommended O
dosage O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
50 O
mg O
day O
can O
be O
administered O
without O
regard O
to O
food. O
There O
are O
no O
clinically O
significant O
effects O
of O
age, O
sex O
or O
race O
on O
the O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
losartan, B-Chemical
and O
no O
dosage O
adjustment O
is O
necessary O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
mild O
hepatic B-Disease
impairment I-Disease
or O
various O
degrees O
of O
renal B-Disease
insufficiency. I-Disease
Losartan, B-Chemical
or O
its O
E B-Chemical
3174 I-Chemical
metabolite, O
is O
not O
removed O
during O
haemodialysis. O
The O
major O
metabolic O
pathway O
for O
losartan B-Chemical
is O
by O
the O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) I-Gene
3A4, I-Gene
2C9 I-Gene
and I-Gene
2C10 I-Gene
isoenzymes. O
Overall, O
losartan B-Chemical
has O
a O
favorable O
drug-drug O
interaction O
profile, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
clinically O
relevant O
interactions O
between O
this O
drug O
and O
a O
range O
of O
inhibitors O
and O
stimulators O
of O
the O
CYP450 O
system. O
Losartan B-Chemical
does O
not O
have O
a O
drug-drug O
interaction O
with O
hydrochlorothiazide, B-Chemical
warfarin B-Chemical
or O
digoxin. B-Chemical
Losartan B-Chemical
should O
be O
avoided O
in O
pregnancy, O
as O
is O
the O
case O
with O
all O
other O
angiotensin-receptor O
antagonists. O
When O
given O
in O
the O
second O
and O
third O
trimester O
of O
pregnancy, O
losartan B-Chemical
is O
often O
associated O
with O
serious O
fetal B-Disease
toxicity. I-Disease
Losartan B-Chemical
is O
a O
competitive O
antagonist O
that O
causes O
a O
parallel O
rightward O
shift O
of O
the O
concentration-contractile O
response O
curve O
to O
angiotensin-II, B-Gene
while O
E B-Chemical
3174 I-Chemical
is O
a O
noncompetitive O
"insurmountable" O
antagonist O
of O
angiotensin-II. B-Gene
The O
maximum O
recommended O
daily O
dose O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
is O
100mg, O
which O
can O
be O
given O
as O
a O
once-daily O
dose O
or O
by O
splitting O
the O
same O
total O
daily O
dose O
into O
two O
doses. O
Losartan B-Chemical
reduces O
blood O
pressure O
comparably O
to O
other O
angiotensin-receptor O
antagonists. O
Losartan B-Chemical
has O
been O
extensively O
studied O
relative O
to O
end-organ O
protection, O
with O
studies O
having O
been O
conducted O
in O
diabetic B-Disease
nephropathy, I-Disease
heart B-Disease
failure, I-Disease
post-myocardial O
infarction O
and O
hypertensive B-Disease
patients B-Species
with O
left B-Disease
ventricular I-Disease
hypertrophy. I-Disease
The O
results O
of O
these O
studies O
have O
been O
sufficiently O
positive O
to O
support O
a O
more O
widespread O
use O
of O
angiotensin-receptor O
antagonists O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
various O
end-organ B-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
Losartan, B-Chemical
like O
other O
angiotensin-receptor O
antagonists, O
is O
devoid O
of O
significant O
adverse O
effects. O
