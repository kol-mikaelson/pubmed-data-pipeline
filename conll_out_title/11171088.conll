# Abstract
Melanin B-Chemical
synthesis O
in O
mammals O
is O
catalysed O
by O
at O
least O
three O
enzymic O
proteins, O
tyrosinase B-Gene
(monophenol O
dihydroxyphenylalanine:oxygen O
oxidoreductase, O
EC O
1.14.18.1) O
and O
tyrosinase-related O
proteins O
(tyrps) B-Gene
1 I-Gene
and I-Gene
2, I-Gene
whose O
genes O
map O
to O
the O
albino, O
brown O
and O
slaty O
loci O
in O
mice, B-Species
respectively. O
Tyrosinase B-Gene
catalyses O
the O
rate-limiting O
generation O
of O
L-dopaquinone B-Chemical
from O
L-tyrosine B-Chemical
and O
is O
also O
able O
to O
oxidize O
L-dopa B-Chemical
to O
L-dopaquinone. B-Chemical
Conversely, O
mouse B-Species
tyrp1, B-Gene
but O
not O
tyrosinase, B-Gene
catalyses O
the O
oxidation O
of O
the O
indolic O
intermediate O
5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(DHICA) B-Chemical
into O
the O
corresponding O
5,6-indolequinone-2-carboxylic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
thus O
promoting O
the O
incorporation O
of O
DHICA B-Chemical
units O
into O
eumelanin. B-Chemical
The O
catalytic O
activities O
of O
the O
human B-Species
melanogenic O
enzymes O
are O
still O
debated. O
TYRP1 B-Gene
has O
been O
reported O
to O
lack O
DHICA B-Chemical
oxidase I-Gene
activity, O
whereas O
tyrosinase B-Gene
appears O
to O
accelerate O
DHICA B-Chemical
consumption, O
thus O
raising O
the O
question O
of O
DHICA B-Chemical
metabolism O
in O
human B-Species
melanocytes. O
Here O
we O
have O
used O
two O
different O
approaches, O
comparison O
of O
the O
catalytic O
activities O
of O
human B-Species
melanocytic O
cell O
lines O
expressing O
the O
full O
set O
of O
melanogenic O
enzymes O
or O
deficient O
in O
TYRP1, B-Gene
and O
transient O
expression O
of O
TYR O
and O
tyr O
genes O
in O
COS7 B-CellLine
cells, O
to O
demonstrate O
that O
human B-Species
tyrosinase B-Gene
actually O
functions O
as O
a O
DHICA B-Chemical
oxidase, I-Gene
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
mouse B-Species
enzyme. O
Therefore, O
human B-Species
tyrosinase B-Gene
displays O
a O
broader O
substrate O
specificity O
than O
its O
mouse B-Species
counterpart, O
and O
might O
be O
at O
least O
partially O
responsible O
for O
the O
incorporation O
of O
DHICA B-Chemical
units O
into O
human B-Species
eumelanins. B-Chemical
