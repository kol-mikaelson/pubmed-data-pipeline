# Abstract
Here O
we O
report O
the O
molecular O
identification O
of O
cytosolic O
glutathione B-Chemical
(GSH)-dependent O
prostaglandin O
(PG) O
E(2) O
synthase O
(cPGES), B-Gene
a O
terminal O
enzyme O
of O
the O
cyclooxygenase O
(COX)-1-mediated O
PGE(2) B-Chemical
biosynthetic O
pathway. O
GSH-dependent O
PGES B-Gene
activity O
in O
the O
cytosol O
of O
rat B-Species
brains, O
but O
not O
of O
other O
tissues, O
increased O
3-fold O
after O
lipopolysaccharide B-Chemical
(LPS) B-Chemical
challenge. O
Peptide O
microsequencing O
of O
purified O
enzyme O
revealed O
that O
it O
was O
identical O
to O
p23, B-Gene
which O
is O
reportedly O
the O
weakly O
bound O
component O
of O
the O
steroid O
hormone O
receptor O
hsp90 B-Gene
complex. O
Recombinant O
p23 B-Gene
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
293 B-CellLine
cells O
exhibited O
all O
the O
features O
of O
PGES B-Gene
activity O
detected O
in O
rat B-Species
brain O
cytosol. O
A O
tyrosine B-Chemical
residue O
near O
the O
N O
terminus O
(Tyr(9)), O
which O
is O
known O
to O
be O
critical O
for O
the O
activity O
of O
cytosolic O
GSH B-Chemical
S-transferases, O
was O
essential O
for O
PGES B-Gene
activity. O
The O
expression O
of O
cPGES B-Gene
p23 B-Gene
was O
constitutive O
and O
was O
unaltered O
by O
proinflammatory O
stimuli O
in O
various O
cells O
and O
tissues, O
except O
that O
it O
was O
increased O
significantly O
in O
rat B-Species
brain O
after O
LPS B-Chemical
treatment. O
cPGES B-Gene
p23 B-Gene
was O
functionally O
linked O
with O
COX-1 B-Gene
in O
marked O
preference O
to O
COX-2 B-Gene
to O
produce O
PGE(2) B-Chemical
from O
exogenous O
and O
endogenous O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
the O
latter O
being O
supplied O
by O
cytosolic O
phospholipase B-Gene
A(2) I-Gene
in O
the O
immediate O
response. O
Thus, O
functional O
coupling O
between O
COX-1 B-Gene
and O
cPGES B-Gene
p23 B-Gene
may O
contribute O
to O
production O
of O
the O
PGE(2) B-Chemical
that O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
maintenance O
of O
tissue O
homeostasis. O
