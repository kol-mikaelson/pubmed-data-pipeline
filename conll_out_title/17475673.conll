# Abstract
This O
study O
examined O
the O
inward O

of O
l-[(14)C]alanine, B-Chemical
an O
ASCT2 B-Gene

WKY O
and O
SHR O

also O
evaluated. O
l-[(14)C]alanine B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
highly O

Na(+)-dependent O
l-alanine B-Chemical
uptake O
in O
WKY O

was O
inhibited O
by O
alanine, B-Chemical

Na(+)-dependent O
l-alanine B-Chemical
transport O
under O
V(max) O

normotensive O
WKY O

In O
conclusion, O
immortalized O
SHR O

WKY O
PTE O
cells O
take O
up O
l-alanine B-Chemical
mainly O
through O
a O
high-affinity O
Na(+)-dependent O
amino O
acid O
transporter, O
with O
functional O
features O
of O
ASCT2 B-Gene
transport. O
The O
activity O
and O

of O
the O
ASCT2 B-Gene
transporter O
were O
considerably O
lower O
in O
