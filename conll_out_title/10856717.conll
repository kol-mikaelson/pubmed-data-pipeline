# Abstract
Transbilayer O
phospholipid B-Chemical
asymmetry O
is O
a O
common O
structural O
feature O
of O
most O
biological O
membranes. O
This O
organization O
of O
lipids B-Chemical
is O
generated O
and O
maintained O
by O
a O
number O
of O
phospholipid B-Chemical
transporters O
that O
vary O
in O
lipid O
specificity, O
energy O
requirements O
and O
direction O
of O
transport. O
These O
transporters O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
three O
classes: O
(1) O
bidirectional, O
non-energy O
dependent O
'scramblases', O
and O
energy-dependent O
transporters O
that O
move O
lipids B-Chemical
(2) O
toward O
('flippases') O
or O
(3) O
away O
from O
('floppases') O
the O
cytofacial O
surface O
of O
the O
membrane. O
One O
of O
the O
more O
elusive O
members O
of O
this O
family O
is O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
aminophospholipid B-Chemical
flippase, O
which O
selectively O
transports O
phosphatidylserine O
from O
the O
external O
to O
the O
cytofacial O
monolayer O
of O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
This O
review O
summarizes O
the O
characteristics O
of O
aminophospholipid B-Chemical
flippase O
activity O
in O
intact O
cells O
and O
describes O
current O
strategies O
to O
identify O
and O
isolate O
this O
protein. O
The O
biochemical O
characteristics O
of O
candidate O
flippases O
are O
critically O
compared O
and O
their O
potential O
role O
in O
flippase O
activity O
is O
evaluated. O
