# Abstract
The O
synthesis O
of O
7alpha-hydroxylated B-Chemical
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
from O
oxysterols B-Chemical
requires O
an O
oxysterol B-Gene
7alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
encoded O
by O
the O
Cyp7b1 B-Gene
locus. O
As O
expected, O
mice B-Species
deficient O
in O
this O
enzyme O
have O
elevated O
plasma O
and O
tissue O
levels O
of O
25- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
27-hydroxycholesterol; I-Chemical
however, O
levels O
of O
another O
major O
oxysterol, B-Chemical
24-hydroxycholesterol, B-Chemical
are O
not O
increased O
in O
these O
mice, B-Species
suggesting O
the O
presence O
of O
another O
oxysterol B-Gene
7alpha-hydroxylase. I-Gene
Here, O
we O
describe O
the O
cloning O
and O
characterization O
of O
murine B-Species
and O
human B-Species
cDNAs O
and O
genes O
that O
encode O
a O
second O
oxysterol B-Gene
7alpha-hydroxylase. I-Gene
The O
genes O
contain O
12 O
exons O
and O
are O
located O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
6 I-Chromosome
in O
the O
human B-Species
(CYP39A1 B-Gene
locus) O
and O
in O
a O
syntenic O
position O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
17 I-Chromosome
in O
the O
mouse B-Species
(Cyp39a1 B-Gene
locus). O
CYP39A1 B-Gene
is O
a O
microsomal O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
enzyme O
that O
has O
preference O
for O
24-hydroxycholesterol B-Chemical
and O
is O
expressed O
in O
the O
liver. O
The O
levels O
of O
hepatic O
CYP39A1 B-Gene
mRNA O
do O
not O
change O
in O
response O
to O
dietary O
cholesterol, B-Chemical
bile B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
or O
a O
bile B-Chemical
acid-binding I-Chemical
resin, I-Chemical
unlike O
those O
encoding O
other O
sterol B-Gene
7alpha-hydroxylases. I-Gene
Hepatic O
CYP39A1 B-Gene
expression O
is O
sexually O
dimorphic O
(female O
> O
male), O
which O
is O
opposite O
that O
of O
CYP7B1 B-Gene
(male O
> O
female). O
We O
conclude O
that O
oxysterol B-Gene
7alpha-hydroxylases I-Gene
with O
different O
substrate O
specificities O
exist O
in O
mice B-Species
and O
humans B-Species
and O
that O
sexually O
dimorphic O
expression O
patterns O
of O
these O
enzymes O
in O
the O
mouse B-Species
may O
underlie O
differences O
in O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism O
between O
the O
sexes. O
