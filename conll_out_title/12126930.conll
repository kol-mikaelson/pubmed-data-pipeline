# Abstract
In O
mammals, O
the O
conversion O
of O
alpha-aminoadipate B-Chemical
to O
alpha-ketoadipate B-Chemical
by O
alpha-aminoadipate B-Gene
aminotransferase I-Gene
(AADAT) B-Gene
is O
an O
intermediate O
step O
in O
lysine B-Chemical
degradation. O
A O
gene O
encoding O
for O
alpha-aminoadipate B-Gene
aminotransferase I-Gene
and O
kynurenine O
aminotransferase O
activities O
had O
been O
previously O
identified O
in O
the O
rat B-Species
(KAT O
AadAT). B-Gene
We O
identified O
the O
human B-Species
gene O
(AADAT) B-Gene
encoding O
for O
AADAT. B-Gene
It O
has O
a O
2329 O
bp O
cDNA, O
a O
1278 O
bp O
open-reading O
frame, O
and O
is O
predicted O
to O
encode O
425 O
amino O
acids O
with O
a O
mitochondrial O
cleavage O
signal O
and O
a O
pyridoxal-phosphate B-Chemical
binding O
site. O
AADAT B-Gene
is O
73% O
and O
72% O
identical O
to O
the O
mouse B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
orthologs, O
respectively. O
The O
genomic O
structure O
spans O
30 O
kb O
and O
consists O
of O
13 O
exons. O
FISH O
studies O
localized O
the O
gene O
to O
4q32.2. B-Chromosome
Two O
transcripts O
(approximately O
2.9 O
and O
approximately O
4.7 O
kb) O
were O
identified, O
with O
expression O
highest O
in O
liver. O
Bacterial O
expression O
studies O
confirm O
that O
the O
gene O
encodes O
for O
AADAT B-Gene
activity. O
The O
availability O
of O
the O
DNA O
sequence O
and O
enzyme O
assay O
will O
allow O
further O
evaluation O
of O
individuals O
suspected O

in O
this O
enzyme. O
