# Abstract
Animals, O
including O
humans, B-Species
express O
two O
isoforms O
of O
acetyl-CoA O
carboxylase O
(EC O
), O
ACC1 B-Gene
(M(r) O
= O
265 O
kDa) O
and O
ACC2 O
(M(r) O
= O
280 O
kDa). O
The O
predicted O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
of O
ACC2 O
contains O
an O
additional O
136 O
aa O
relative O
to O
ACC1, B-Gene
114 O
of O
which O
constitute O
the O
unique O
N-terminal O
sequence O
of O
ACC2. O
The O
hydropathic O
profiles O
of O
the O
two O
ACC B-Disease
isoforms O
generally O
are O
comparable, O
except O
for O
the O
unique O
N-terminal O
sequence O
in O
ACC2. O
The O
sequence O
of O
amino O
acid O
residues O
1-20 O
of O
ACC2 O
is O
highly O
hydrophobic, O
suggesting O
that O
it O
is O
a O
leader O
sequence O
that O
targets O
ACC2 O
for O
insertion O
into O
membranes. O
The O
subcellular O
localization O
of O
ACC2 O
in O
mammalian O
cells O
was O
determined O
by O
performing O
immunofluorescence O
microscopic O
analysis O
using O
affinity-purified O
anti-ACC2-specific O
antibodies O
and O
transient O
expression O
of O
the O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
fused O
to O
the O
C O
terminus O
of O
the O
N-terminal O
sequences O
of O
ACC1 B-Gene
and O
ACC2. O
These O
analyses O
demonstrated O
that O
ACC1 B-Gene
is O
a O
cytosolic O
protein O
and O
that O
ACC2 O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
mitochondria, O
a O
finding O
that O
was O
confirmed O
further O
by O
the O
immunocolocalization O
of O
a O
known O
human B-Species
mitochondria-specific O
protein O
and O
the O
carnitine O
palmitoyltransferase O
1. O
Based O
on O
analyses O
of O
the O
fusion O
proteins O
of O
ACC-green O
fluorescent O
protein, O
we O
concluded O
that O
the O
N-terminal O
sequences O
of O
ACC2 O
are O
responsible O
for O
mitochondrial O
targeting O
of O
ACC2. O
The O
association O
of O
ACC2 O
with O
the O
mitochondria O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
ACC2 O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
mitochondrial O
fatty O
acid O
oxidation O
through O
the O
inhibition O
of O
carnitine O
palmitoyltransferase O
1 O
by O
its O
product O
malonyl-CoA. O
