# Abstract
The O
SLC6 O
family O
is O
a O
diverse O
set O
of O
transporters O
that O
mediate O
solute O
translocation O
across O
cell O
plasma O
membranes O
by O
coupling O
solute O
transport O
to O
the O
cotransport O
of O
sodium B-Chemical
and O
chloride B-Chemical
down O
their O
electrochemical O
gradients. O
These O
transporters O
probably O
have O
12 O
transmembrane O
domains, O
with O
cytoplasmic O
N- O
and O
C-terminal O
tails, O
and O
at O
least O
some O
may O
function O
as O
homo-oligomers. O
Family O
members O
include O
the O
transporters O
for O
the O
inhibitory O
neurotransmitters O
GABA B-Chemical
and O
glycine, B-Chemical
the O
aminergic O
transmitters O
norepinephrine, B-Chemical
serotonin, B-Chemical
and O
dopamine, B-Chemical
the O
osmolytes O
betaine B-Chemical
and O
taurine, B-Chemical
the O
amino O
acid O
proline, B-Chemical
and O
the O
metabolic O
compound O
creatine. B-Chemical
In O
addition, O
this O
family O
includes O
a O
system O
B(0+) O
cationic O
and O
neutral O
amino O
acid O
transporter, O
and O
two O
transporters O
for O
which O
the O
solutes O
are O
unknown. O
In O
general, O
SLC6 O
transporters O
act O
to O
regulate O
the O
level O
of O
extracellular O
solute O
concentrations. O
In O
the O
central O
and O
the O
peripheral O
nervous O
system, O
these O
transporters O
can O
regulate O
signaling O
among O
neurons, O
are O
the O
sites O
of O
action O
of O
various O
drugs O
of O
abuse, O
and O
naturally O
occurring O
mutations O
in O
several O
of O
these O
proteins O
are O
associated O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
neurological O
disorders. O
For O
example, O
transgenic O
animals O
lacking O
specific O
aminergic O
transporters O
show O
profoundly O
disturbed O
behavioral O
phenotypes O
and O
probably O
represent O
excellent O
systems O
for O
investigating O
psychiatric O
disease. O
SLC6 O
transporters O
are O
also O
found O
in O
many O
non-neural O
tissues, O
including O
kidney, O
intestine, O
and O
testis, O
consistent O
with O
their O
diverse O
physiological O
roles. O
Transporters O
in O
this O
family O
represent O
attractive O
therapeutic O
targets O
because O
they O
are O
subject O
to O
multiple O
forms O
of O
regulation O
by O
many O
different O
signaling O
cascades, O
and O
because O
a O
number O
of O
pharmacological O
agents O
have O
been O
identified O
that O
act O
specifically O
on O
these O
proteins. O
