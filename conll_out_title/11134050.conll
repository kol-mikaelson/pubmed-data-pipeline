# Abstract
Monoamine O
oxidase O
(MAO) O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
oxidation O
of O
biogenic O
and O
dietary O
amines. B-Chemical
It O
exists O
as O
two O
isoforms, O
A O
and O
B, O
which O
have O
a O
70% O
amino O
acid O
identity O
and O
different O
substrate O
and O
inhibitor O
specificities. O
This O
study O
reports O
the O
identification O
of O
residues O
responsible O
for O
conferring O
this O
specificity O
in O
human B-Species

Using O
site-directed O

we O
reciprocally O
interchanged O
three O

the O
central O

human B-Species

A I-Gene
preferred O
substrate O
serotonin B-Chemical
(5-hydroxytryptamine), B-Chemical

became O
more O

to O
deprenyl B-Chemical
(MAO O
B-specific O
inhibitor) O
than O
to O
clorgyline B-Chemical
(MAO O

The O
reciprocal O

MAO O
B-Y326I O
exhibited O
an O
increased O
preference O
for O
5-hydroxytryptamine, B-Chemical
a O

beta-phenylethylamine, B-Chemical
and, O
similar O
