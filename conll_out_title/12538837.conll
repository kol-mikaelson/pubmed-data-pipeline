# Abstract
Agmatine B-Chemical
has O
received O
considerable O
attention O
recently. O
Available O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
agmatine B-Chemical
functions O
as O
a O
neurotransmitter O
and O
inhibits, O
via O
induction O
of O
antizyme, O
cellular O
proliferation. O
Because O
of O
its O
positive O
charge, O
agmatine B-Chemical
will O
not O
appreciably O
cross O
cellular O
membranes O
by O
simple O
diffusion. O
Indeed, O
all O
physiological O
models O
require O
a O
channel O
or O
transporter O
protein O
in O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
to O
effect O
inactivation O
or O
nonexocytotic O
release O
of O
agmatine. B-Chemical
However, O
a O
transport O
mechanism O
for O
agmatine B-Chemical
has O
not O
been O
identified O
on O
a O
molecular O
level O
so O
far. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
the O
non-neuronal O
monoamine O
transporters, O
organic B-Gene

transporter I-Gene
(EMT) B-Gene
(gene O
symbols O
SLC22A1-A3), B-Gene
both O
from O
human B-Species
and O
rat, B-Species
were O
examined, O
stably O
expressed O
in O
293 B-CellLine
cells, O
for O
[(3)H]agmatine B-Chemical
transport. O
Our O
results O
indicate O
that O
OCT2 B-Gene
and O
EMT, B-Gene
but O
not O
OCT1, B-Gene
efficiently O
translocate O
agmatine. B-Chemical
The O
structural O
homolog O
putrescine B-Chemical
was O
not O
accepted O
as O
substrate. O
Uptake O
of O
agmatine B-Chemical
via O
EMT B-Gene
and O
OCT2 B-Gene
was O
saturable, O
with O
K(m) O
values O
of O
1 O
to O
2 O
mM. O
The O
affinity O
of O
OCT1 B-Gene
was O
10-fold O
lower. O
Carrier-mediated O
efflux O
of O
agmatine B-Chemical
was O
documented O
in O
a O
trans-stimulation O
experiment. O
Finally, O
uptake O
of O
agmatine B-Chemical
increased O
dramatically O
with O
increasing O
pH. O
Thus, O
only O
the O
singly O
charged O
species O
of O
agmatine B-Chemical
is O
accepted O
as O
substrate. O
In O
conclusion, O
both O
EMT B-Gene
and O
OCT2 B-Gene
must O
be O
considered O
for O
the O
control O
of O
agmatine B-Chemical
levels O
in O
rat B-Species
and O
human. B-Species
