# Abstract
Triacylglycerol B-Gene
hydrolase I-Gene
mobilizes O
stored O
triacylglycerol B-Chemical
some O
of O
which O
is O
used O
for O
very-low-density O
lipoprotein O
assembly O
in O
the O
liver. O
A O
full-length O
cDNA O
coding O
for O
a O
human B-Species
triacylglycerol B-Gene
hydrolase I-Gene
(hTGH) O
was O
isolated O
from O
a O
human B-Species
liver O
cDNA O
library. O
The O
cDNA O
has O
an O
open O
reading O
frame O
of O
576 O
amino O
acids O
with O
a O
cleavable O
18-amino-acid O
signal O
sequence. O
The O
deduced O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
shows O
that O
the O
protein O
belongs O
to O
the O
carboxylesterase O
family. O
The O
hTGH O
was O
highly O
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
as O
a O
6xHis-tagged O
fusion O
protein, O
with O
the O
tag O
at O
the O
N-terminus O
in O
place O
of O
the O
signal O
peptide. O
However, O
the O
expressed O
protein O
was O
insoluble O
and O
inactive. O
Expression O
was O
confirmed O
by O
immunoblotting O
and O
N-terminal O
amino O
acid O
sequencing O
of O
the O
purified O
protein. O
Expression O
of O
hTGH O
with O
its O
native O
signal O
sequence O
and O
a O
C-terminal O
6xHis-tag O
in O
Sf9 B-CellLine
cells O
using O
the O
baculovirus B-Species
expression O
system O
yielded O
active O
enzyme. O
N-terminal O
amino O
acid O
sequencing O
of O
the O
purified O
expressed O
protein O
showed O
correct O
processing O
of O
the O
signal O
peptide. O
The O
enzyme O
also O
undergoes O
glycosylation O
within O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
lumen. O
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
hTGH O
expressed O
in O
insect B-CellLine
cells O
is O
properly O
folded. O
Therefore, O
baculovirus B-Species
expression O
of O
hTGH O
and O
facile O
purification O
of O
the O
His-tagged O
enzyme O
will O
allow O
detailed O
characterization O
of O
the O
structure O
activity O
relationship. O
