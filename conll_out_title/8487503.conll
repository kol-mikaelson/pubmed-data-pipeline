# Abstract
A O
review O
is O
presented O
of O
22 O
published O
cases O
of O
verified O
or O
probable O
mitochondrial B-Disease
2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA I-Disease
thiolase I-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
a O
disorder O
of O
isoleucine B-Disease
and I-Disease
ketone I-Disease
body B-Disease
metabolism. O
The O
clinical O
expression, O
characterized O
by O
ketoacidosis, B-Disease
vomiting B-Disease
and O
lethargy, B-Disease
is O
highly O
variable. O
Typical O
age O
of O
onset O
is O
between O
6 O
and O
24 O
months. O
The O
disorder, O
which O
has O
been O
observed O
in O
several O
ethnic O
groups, O
is O
apparently O
inherited O
as O
an O
autosomal, O
recessive O
trait. O
The O
prognosis O
is O
relatively O
good O
if O
acute O
episodes O
of O
ketoacidosis B-Disease
and O
dehydration B-Disease
are O
adequately O
treated. O
There O
is O
abnormal O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
tiglylglycine, B-Chemical
and O
in O
some O
instances O
also O
2-methyl-acetoacetic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
However, O
such O
a O
pattern O
of O
organic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
has O
also O
been O
found O
in O
cases O
with O
normal O
thiolase O
activity. O
Genetic O
complementation O
analyses O
have O
demonstrated O
considerable O
heterogeneity. O
The O
cDNA O
for O
human B-Species
methyl-acetoacetyl-CoA O
thiolase O
has O
been O
cloned O
and O
sequenced. O
Studies O
in O
one O
patient B-Species
showed O
a O
G-to-A B-DNAMutation
substitution I-DNAMutation
at I-DNAMutation
position I-DNAMutation
1138 I-DNAMutation
of O
the O
mRNA, O
causing O
347Ala B-ProteinMutation
to I-ProteinMutation
Thr I-ProteinMutation
change O
in O
the O
mature O
enzyme. O
Studies O
in O
other O
patients O
have O
shown O
variable O
enzyme O
amount O
and O
or O
stability. O
