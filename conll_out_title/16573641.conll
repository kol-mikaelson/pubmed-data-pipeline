# Abstract
Glutaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(GA) B-Chemical
and O
3-hydroxyglutaric B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(3-OH-GA) B-Chemical
are O
key O
metabolites O
in O
glutaryl B-Disease
co-enzyme I-Disease
A I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
(GCDH) B-Gene
deficiency I-Disease
and O
are O
both O
considered O
to O
be O
potential O
neurotoxins. O
As O
cerebral O
concentrations O
of O
GA B-Chemical
and O
3-OH-GA B-Chemical
have O
not O
yet O
been O
studied O
systematically, O
we O
investigated O
the O
tissue-specific O
distribution O
of O
these O
organic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
glutarylcarnitine B-Chemical
in O
brain, O
liver, O
skeletal O
and O
heart O
muscle O
of O
Gcdh-deficient O
mice B-Species
as O
well O
as O
in O
hepatic O
Gcdh- B-Gene
- O
mice B-Species
and O
in O
C57Bl O
6 O
mice B-Species
following O
intraperitoneal O
loading. O
Furthermore, O
we O
determined O
the O
flux O
of O
GA B-Chemical
and O
3-OH-GA B-Chemical
across O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
(BBB) O
using O
porcine O
brain O
microvessel O
endothelial O
cells. O
Concentrations O
of O
GA, B-Chemical
3-OH-GA B-Chemical
and O
glutarylcarnitine B-Chemical
were O
significantly O
elevated O
in O
all O
tissues O
of O
Gcdh- B-Gene
- O
mice. B-Species
Strikingly, O
cerebral O
concentrations O
of O
GA B-Chemical
and O
3-OH-GA B-Chemical
were O
unexpectedly O
high, O
reaching O
similar O
concentrations O
as O
those O
found O
in O
liver. O
In O
contrast, O
cerebral O
concentrations O
of O
these O
organic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
remained O
low O
in O
hepatic O
Gcdh- B-Gene
- O
mice B-Species
and O
after O
intraperitoneal O
injection O
of O
GA B-Chemical
and O
3-OH-GA. B-Chemical
These O
results O
suggest O
limited O
flux O
of O
GA B-Chemical
and O
3-OH-GA B-Chemical
across O
the O
BBB, O
which O
was O
supported O
in O
cultured O
porcine O
brain O
capillary O
endothelial O
cells. O
In O
conclusion, O
we O
propose O
that O
an O
intracerebral O
de O
novo O
synthesis O
and O
subsequent O
trapping O
of O
GA B-Chemical
and O
3-OH-GA B-Chemical
should O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
biochemical O
risk O
factor O
for O
neurodegeneration B-Disease
in O
GCDH B-Gene
deficiency. O
