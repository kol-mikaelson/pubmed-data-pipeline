# Abstract
Retinoids B-Chemical
(vitamin B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
and O
its O
derivatives) O
are O
potent O
substances O
for O
regulating O
the O
expression O
of O
many O
different O
genes O
within O
the O
body. O
The O
gene O
regulatory O
activities O
of O
retinoids B-Chemical
are O
mediated O
primarily O
by O
the O
all-trans O
and O
9-cis B-Chemical
isomers O
of O
retinoic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Although O
13-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(isotretinoin) B-Chemical
does O
not O
have O
the O
potent O
gene O
regulatory O
activity O
of O
the O
other O
two O
isomers, O
it O
is O
an O
effective O
pharmacologic O
agent O
for O
treating O
a O
variety O
of O
dermatologic O
conditions. O
Because O
13-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
also O
a O
naturally O
occurring O
retinoid B-Chemical
that O
is O
present O
in O
the O
circulation, O
question O
is O
raised O
as O
to O
the O
biochemical O
mechanism(s) O
responsible O
for O
its O
pharmacologic O
efficacy. O
Some O
of O
this O
efficacy O
likely O
arises O
from O
the O
ability O
of O
13-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
undergo O
isomerization O
to O
the O
significantly O
more O
active O
all-trans O
and O
9-cis B-Chemical
isomers; O
however, O
this O
does O
not O
account O
for O
all O
of O
the O
pharmacologic O
effects O
observed O
upon O
use O
of O
this O
retinoid. B-Chemical
Some O
recent O
studies O
suggest O
that O
13-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
may O
act O
by O
inhibiting O
the O
actions O
of O
enzymes O
that O
are O
needed O
to O
metabolize O
steroids, B-Chemical
while O
other O
recent O
studies O
indicate O
that O
13-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
acts O
through O
membrane O
receptors O
present O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
cells. O
At O
the O
present, O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
rule O
out O
still O
other O
possible O
biochemical O
actions O
of O
13-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
in O
the O
body. O
It O
is O
clear, O
however, O
that O
if O
we O
are O
to O
fully O
understand O
the O
basis O
for O
the O
clinical O
efficacy O
of O
13-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
such O
biochemical O
actions O
is O
needed. O
