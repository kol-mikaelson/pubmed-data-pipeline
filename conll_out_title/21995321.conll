# Abstract
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
generate, O
by O
real-time O
PCR, O
a O
quantitative O
expression O
level O
profile O
of O
the O
19 O
human B-Species
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases O
(UGTs) O
of O
subfamilies O
1A, O
2A O
and O
2B, O
in O
26 O
adult O
and O
3 O
fetal O
tissues, O
for O
better O
understanding O
of O
their O
roles O
in O
xenobiotic O
and O
endobiotic O
metabolism. O
Adult O
liver O
contained O
the O
highest O
level O
of O
combined O
UGTs O
mRNA, O
and O
UGT2B4 B-Gene
was O
the O
most O
abundant O
isoform O
in O
this O
tissue O
(40% O
of O
total). O
Other O
well O
expressed O
hepatic O
UGTs, O

were O
1A9, O

2B28. B-Gene
UGT2B4 B-Gene
was O
by O
far O
the O
most O
abundant O
isoform O
in O
the O
fetal O
liver O
(90% O
of O
total). O
The O
combined O
UGT B-Gene
mRNA O
expression O
in O
both O
adult O
and O
fetal O
olfactory O
epithelium O
was O
high, O
about O
20% O
the O
adult O
hepatic O
level. O
Interestingly, O
a O
large O
developmental O
change O
was O
found O
in O
this O
tissue O
from O
high O
UGT2A1 B-Gene
and O
UGT2A2 O
expression O
in O
the O
fetus O
to O
UGT1A6 O
in O
the O
adult. O
The O
most O
abundantly O
expressed O
UGTs O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
were O
2A3, O
1A10, O
1A1, O
1A6 O
and O
2B7, O
while O
1A10 O
and O
2A3 O
predominated O
in O
the O
colon. O
The O
results O
provide O
the O
most O
comprehensive O
data O
to O
date O
on O
the O
tissue O
distribution O
of O
the O
human B-Species
UGTs. O
