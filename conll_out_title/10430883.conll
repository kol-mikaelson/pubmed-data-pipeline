Among O

Recently O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
these O

Herein O
we O
describe O
the O

a O
human B-Species
alpha1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase B-Gene
(alpha4GnT), B-Gene
a O
key O

for O
the O
formation O

GlcNAcalpha1-->4Galbeta1-->R. O
COS-1 B-CellLine

thus O
cotransfected O

specific O

enriched O
by O
fluorescence-activated O

Sibling O
selection O

that O
directs O
the O

The O
alpha4GnT B-Gene

located O
at O
chromosome B-Chromosome
3p14.3, I-Chromosome

An O
