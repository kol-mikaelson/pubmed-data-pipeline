# Abstract
The O
first O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
in O
vivo O
absorption, O
biliary O
secretion, O
and O
first-pass O
effect O
of O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
following O
regional O
intestinal O
dosing O
in O
the O
rat. B-Species
We O
also O
examined O
the O
membrane O
transport O
mechanisms O
and O
made O
in O
silico O
predictions O
of O
the O
relative O
importance O
of O
various O
intestinal O
regions O
to O
the O
human B-Species
absorption O
of O
fluvastatin. B-Chemical
Fluvastatin B-Chemical
was O
administered O
intravenously O
(2, O
10, O
and O
20 O
micromol O
kg) O
and O
into O
the O
duodenum O
(1.46, O
2.92, O
7.32, O
and O
14.6 O
micromol O
kg), O
jejunum O
(14.6 O
micromol O
kg), O
ileum O
(1.46 O
and O
14.6 O
mciromol B-Chemical
kg), O
and O
colon O
(1.46 O
and O
14.6 O
micromol O
kg) O
as O
a O
solution O
to O
conscious O
rats. B-Species
In O
a O
separate O
group O
of O
rats, B-Species
bile O
was O
collected O
after O
an O
i.v. O
dose O
of O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
(2 O
micromol O
kg). O
In O
the O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
model O
the O
bidirectional O
transport O
of O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
(16 O
microM) O
was O
investigated O
with O
and O
without O
various O
efflux O
inhibitors O
(verapamil, B-Chemical
vinblastine, B-Chemical
probenecid, B-Chemical
and O
indomethacin, B-Chemical
160 O
microM). O
The O
human B-Species
in O
vivo O
absorption O
of O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
from O
an O
oral O
immediate O
release O
tablet O
and O
that O
from O
an O
oral O
extended O
release O
tablet O
(both O
40 O
mg) O
were O
simulated O
in O
GastroPlus. O
Neither O
the O
dose O
nor O
the O
intestinal O
region O
influenced O
the O
bioavailability O
of O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
significantly. O
The O
rate O
of O
absorption O
was, O
however, O
affected O
by O
both O
the O
dose O
and O
the O
site O
of O
administration; O
duodenum O
= O
jejunum O
> O
colon O
> O
ileum, O
and O
higher O
following O
the O
high O
dose. O
Increasing O
the O
i.v. O
dose O
from O
2 O
to O
20 O
micromol O
kg O
decreased O
the O
clearance O
(26 O
+ O
- O
3 O
to O
12 O
+ O
- O
1 O

min O
kg), O
the O
hepatic O
extraction O
(66 O

to O

2%), O
and O
the O
volume O
of O
distribution O
(7.3 O

0.7 O
L O
kg) O
for O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
(p O
< O
0.05). O
Neither O
bile O
cannulation O
nor O
bile O
sampling O
affected O
the O
pharmacokinetics. O
Fluvastatin B-Chemical
was O
secreted O
into O
the O
bile, O
probably O
by O
active O
transport. O
The O
in O
vitro O
permeability O
for O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
was O
high O
(>10 O
x O
10(-6) O
cm O
s). O
Indomethacin, B-Chemical
but O
not O
the O
other O
inhibitors, O
affected O
the O
transport O
in O
both O
directions O
suggesting O
mrp2 B-Gene
to O
be O
involved. O
In O
silico, O
93% O
of O
the O
dose O
was O
absorbed O
from O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
6% O
from O
the O
colon O
when O
given O
as O
an O
immediate O
release O
formulation. O
The O
corresponding O
values O
for O
an O
extended O
release O
formulation O
were O
21% O
and O
74%, O
respectively. O
In O
conclusion, O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
exhibits O
dose-dependent O
pharmacokinetics O
in O
the O
rat. B-Species
The O
rate O
of O
absorption O
(Cmax, O
Tmax, O
and O
Cmax O
AUC(lqc)) O
from O
the O
intestinal O
tract O
is O
both O
region O
and O
dose-dependent O
in O
the O
rat. B-Species
This O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
involvement O
of O
mrp2 B-Gene
in O
the O
intestine O
and O
or O
in O
the O
liver. O
These O
absorption O
properties O
have O
to O
be O
considered O
in O
the O
development O
of O
an O
extended O
release O
formulation O
of O
fluvastatin. B-Chemical
