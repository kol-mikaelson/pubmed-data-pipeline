# Abstract
Sterol B-Gene
carrier I-Gene
protein I-Gene
X I-Gene
(SCPx) B-Gene
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
the O
peroxisomal O
oxidation O
of O
branched-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
To O
investigate O
whether O
patients B-Species
with O
an O
unresolved O
defect O
in O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation O
are O
deficient O
for O
SCPx, B-Gene
we O
developed O
a O
novel O
and O
specific O
assay O
to O
measure O
the O
activity O
of O
SCPx B-Gene
in O
both O
liver O
and O
fibroblast O
homogenates. O
The O
substrate O
used O
in O
the O
assay, O
3alpha, O
7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-24-keto-5beta-cholestanoy O
l-CoA O
(24-keto-THC-CoA), B-Chemical
is O
produced O
by O
preincubating O
the O
enoyl-CoA B-Chemical
of O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
intermediate O
THCA O
with O
a O
lysate O
from O
the O
yeast B-Species
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
expressing O
human B-Species
D-bifunctional O
protein. O
After O
the O
preincubation O
period, O
liver O
or O
fibroblast O
homogenate O
is O
added O
plus O
CoASH, B-Chemical
and O
the O
production O
of O
choloyl-CoA B-Chemical
is O
determined O
by O
HPLC. O
The O
specificity O
of O
the O
assay O
was O
demonstrated O
by O
the O
finding O
of O
a O
full O
deficiency O
in O
fibroblasts O
from O
an O
SCPx B-Gene
knock-out O
mouse. B-Species
In O
addition O
to O
SCPx B-Gene
activity O
measurements O
in O
fibroblasts O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
a O
defect O
in O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation O
of O
unresolved O
etiology, O
we O
studied O
the O
stability O
and O
activity O
of O
SCPx B-Gene
in O
fibroblasts O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
Zellweger B-Disease
syndrome, I-Disease
which O
lack O
functional O
peroxisomes. O
We O
found O
that O
SCPx B-Gene
is O
not O
only O
stable O
in O
the O
cytosol, O
but O
displays O
a O
higher O
activity O
in O
fibroblasts O
from O
patients B-Species
with O
Zellweger B-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
than O
in O
control O
fibroblasts. O
Furthermore, O
in O
all O
patients B-Species
studied O
with O
a O
defect O
in O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation O
of O
unknown O
origin, O
SCPx B-Gene
was O
found O
to O
be O
normally O
active, O
indicating O
that O
human B-Species
SCPx B-Gene
deficiency O
remains O
to O
be O
identified. O
