# Abstract
N:-Acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline O
(Ac-SDKP) B-Chemical
is O
a O
natural O
inhibitor O
of O
pluripotent O
hematopoietic O
stem O
cell O
entry O
into O
the O
S O
phase O
of O
the O
cell O
cycle O
and O
is O
normally O
present O
in O
human B-Species
plasma. O
Ac-SDKP B-Chemical
is O
exclusively O
hydrolyzed O
by O
ACE, B-Gene
and O
its O
plasma O
concentration O
is O
increased O
5-fold O
after O
ACE B-Gene
inhibition O
in O
humans. B-Species

We O
measured O
hydroxyproline B-Chemical

(3)H-proline B-Chemical
into O
collagenous O

found O
that O
Ac-SDKP B-Chemical
blocked O
endothelin-1 B-Gene
(10(-8) O
mol O
L)-induced O
collagen O
synthesis O
in O
a O
biphasic O
and O
dose-dependent O
manner, O
causing O
inhibition O
at O
low O
doses, O
whereas O
high O
doses O
had O
little O
or O
no O
effect. O
It O
also O
blunted O
the O
activity O
of O
p44 B-Gene
p42 I-Gene
mitogen-activated I-Gene
protein I-Gene
kinase I-Gene
in O
a O
biphasic O

manner O
in O
serum-stimulated O
fibroblasts, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
DNA O
and O
collagen O
synthesis O
may O
depend O
in O
part O
on O
blocking O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
activity. O
Participation O
of O
p44 B-Gene
p42 I-Gene
in O
collagen O

was O
confirmed, O
because O

was O
able O
to O

endothelin-1-induced O

similar O

the O

Ac-SDKP. B-Chemical
The O
fact O
that O
Ac-SDKP B-Chemical
inhibits O
DNA O
and O
collagen O
synthesis O
in O
cardiac O
fibroblasts O
suggests O
that O
it O
may O
be O
an O
important O
endogenous O
regulator O
of O
fibroblast O
proliferation O
and O
collagen O
synthesis O
in O
the O
heart. O
Ac-SDKP B-Chemical
may O
participate O
in O
the O
cardioprotective O
effect O
of O
ACE B-Gene
inhibitors O
by O
limiting O
fibroblast O
proliferation O
(and O
hence O
collagen O
production), O
and O
therefore O
it O
would O
reduce O

hypertension. B-Disease
