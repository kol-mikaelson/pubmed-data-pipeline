# Abstract
The O
oxidative O
metabolism O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
(DuP B-Chemical
753), I-Chemical
a O
novel O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
antagonist, O
by O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
and O
purified O
cytochrome O
P450 B-Gene
(P450) B-Gene
enzymes, O
was O
studied. O
The O
primary O
route O
of O
metabolism O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
is O
by O
oxidation O
of O
the O
C5-hydroxymethyl O
to O
the O
carboxylic O
acid O
(EXP3174), B-Chemical
which O
is O
an O
active O
metabolite O
of O
losartan. B-Chemical
When O
microsomes O
prepared O
from O
different O
human B-Species
liver O
samples O
were O
compared, O
EXP3174 B-Chemical
formation O
activity O
was O
well O
correlated O
(r2 O

with O
nifedipine B-Chemical
oxidation O
(a O
marker O
of O
P4503A4), O
but O
not O
with O
markers O
for O

human B-Species

Microsomal O
oxidation O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
to O
EXP3174 B-Chemical
was O
markedly O
inhibited O
by O
gestodene B-Chemical
and O
ketoconazole, B-Chemical
selective O
inhibitors O
of O
P4503A B-ProteinMutation
enzymes, O
but O
not O
by O
any O
of O
several O
other O
P450 B-Gene
inhibitors. O
Antibodies O
raised O
against O
P4503A4 O
could O
inhibit O
most O
of O
the O
oxidation O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
to O
EXP3174 B-Chemical
in O
a O
microsomal O
sample O
having O
high O
catalytic O
activity, O
but O
antibodies O
recognizing O
other O
P450s O
had O
no O
effect. O
The O
oxidation O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
to O
EXP3174 B-Chemical
was O
catalyzed O
by O
purified O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomal O
P4503A4 O
and O
by O
purified O
bacterial O
recombinant O
P4503A4. O
These O
results O
provide O
evidence O
that O
P4503A4 O
(and O
possibly O
other O
P4503A B-ProteinMutation
enzymes) O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
an O
active O
metabolite O
