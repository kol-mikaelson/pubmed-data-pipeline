# Abstract
PURPOSE: O
The O
characteristics O
of O
bile O
canalicular O
transport O
processes O
for O
xenobiotic O
taurine B-Chemical
conjugates O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
clarified. O
To O
elucidate O
the O
biliary O
excretion O
characteristics O
of O
xenobiotic O
taurine B-Chemical
conjugates, O
we O
investigated O
the O
transport O
of O
a O
novel O
thromboxane B-Gene
A2 I-Gene
receptor I-Gene
antagonist, O
Z-335, B-Chemical
and O
its O
taurine B-Chemical
conjugate O
(Z-335-Tau) O
across O
the O
bile O
canalicular O
membrane. O
METHODS: O
We O
examined O
the O
uptake O
of O
Z-335 B-Chemical
and O
Z-335-Tau O
by O
isolated O
bile O
canalicular O
membrane O
vesicles O
(CMVs) O
from O
Sprague O
Dawley O
and O
Eisai-hyperbilirubinemic O
rats B-Species
(EHBRs) O
which O
EHBRs O
have O
a O
hereditary B-Disease
defect I-Disease
of I-Disease
canalicular O
multidrug B-Gene
resistance-associated I-Gene
protein I-Gene
2 I-Gene
(Mrp2) B-Gene
function. O
Also, O
the O
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo O
kinetics O
of O
Z-335-Tau O
uptake O
and O
excretion O
were O
compared. O
RESULTS: O
Z-335 B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
CMVs O
from O
normal O
rats B-Species
exhibited O
marked O
ATP-dependence, O
whereas O
ATP-dependent O
uptake O
of O
Z-335 B-Chemical
into O
CMVs O
from O
EHBRs O
was O
not O
observed. O
In O
contrast, O
Z-335-Tau O
uptake O
into O
CMVs O
from O
both O
normal O
rats B-Species
and O
EHBRs O
was O
ATP B-Chemical
dependent. O
The O
initial O
uptake O
velocity O
was O
concentration-dependent, O
with O
an O
in O
vitro O
Michaelis O
constant O
for O
initial O
uptake O
of O
189 O
microM, O
which O
was O
similar O
to O
the O
in O
vivo O
value. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
biliary O
excretion O
of O
Z-335 B-Chemical
involves O
Mrp2, B-Gene
whereas O
that O
of O
Z-335-Tau O
involves O
active O
transport O
systems O
that O
remain O
intact O
in O
EHBRs O
and O
show O
marked O
ATP B-Chemical
dependence, O
which O
ATP-dependent O
transport O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
biliary O
excretion O
of O
Z-335-Tau O
in O
vivo. O
