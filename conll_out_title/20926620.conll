# Abstract
The O
chemical O
reactivity O
of O
acyl B-Chemical
glucuronide I-Chemical
(AG) O
has O
been O
thought O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
toxic O
properties O
of O
drugs O
containing O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
moieties, O
but O
there O
has O
been O
no O
direct O
evidence O
that O
AG O
formation O
was O
related O
to O
the O
toxicity. B-Disease
In O
the O
present O
study, O
the O
cytotoxicity B-Disease
and O
genotoxicity B-Disease
of O
AGs B-Chemical
were O
investigated. O
Human B-Species
embryonic O
kidney O
(HEK) B-CellLine
293 B-CellLine
cells O
stably O
expressing O
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase B-Gene
(UGT) I-Gene
1A3 I-Gene
(HEK B-CellLine
UGT1A3) I-CellLine
were O
constructed O
to O
assess O
the O
cytotoxicity B-Disease
of O
AGs, B-Chemical
and O
HEK B-CellLine
UGT1A4 B-Gene
cells O
were O
also O
used O
as O
a O
negative O
reference. O
After O
exposure O
to O
nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
(NSAIDs) O
such O
as O
naproxen B-Chemical
(1 O
mM), O
diclofenac B-Chemical
(0.1 O
mM), O
ketoprofen B-Chemical
(1 O
mM), O
or O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
(1 O
mM) O
for O
24 O
h, O
HEK B-CellLine
UGT1A3 I-CellLine
cells O
produced O
AG O
in O
a O
time-dependent O
manner. O
However, O
HEK B-CellLine
UGT1A4 B-Gene
cells O
hardly O
produced O
AG. O
The O
cytotoxicity B-Disease
of O
HEK B-CellLine
UGT1A3 I-CellLine
cells O
was O
not O
increased O
compared O
with O
that O
of O
HEK B-CellLine
UGT1A4 B-Gene
cells. O
In O
addition, O
the O
AG O
formed O
in O
NSAID-treated O
human B-Species
hepatocytes O
was O
decreased O
from O
one-third O
to O
one-ninth O
by O
treatment O
with O
(-)-borneol, B-Chemical
an O
inhibitor O
of O
acyl O
glucuronidation, O
but O
the O
cytotoxicity B-Disease
was O
increased. O
These O
results O
indicated O
that O
AG O
formation O
reflected O
the O
detoxification O
process O
in O
human B-Species
hepatocytes. O
Furthermore, O
the O
possibility O
of O
genotoxicity B-Disease
from O
the O
AG O
formed O
in O
NSAID-treated O
HEK B-CellLine
UGT O
cells O
was O
investigated O
by O
the O
comet O
assay, O
and O
DNA B-Disease
damage O
was O
not O
detected O
in O
any O
HEK B-CellLine
UGT O
cell O
lines. O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
in O
vitro O
cytotoxic O
and O
genotoxic O
effects O
of O
the O
AGs B-Chemical
of O
NSAIDs O
were O
investigated O
and O
AG O
was O
not O
found O
to O
be O
a O
causal O
factor O
in O
the O
toxicity. B-Disease
