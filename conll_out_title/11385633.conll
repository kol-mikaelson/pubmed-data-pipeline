# Abstract
Glycerol B-Chemical
is O
a O
small O
and O
simple O
molecule O
produced O
in O
the O
breakdown O
of O
glucose, B-Chemical
proteins, O
pyruvate, B-Chemical
triacylglycerols B-Chemical
and O
other O
glycerolipid, B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
release O
from O
dietary O
fats. O
An O
increasing O
number O
of O
observations O
show O
that O
glycerol B-Chemical
is O
probably O
involved O
in O
a O
surprising O
variety O
of O
physiopathologic O
mechanisms. O
Glycerol B-Chemical
has O
long O
been O
known O
to O
play O
fundamental O
roles O
in O
several O
vital O
physiological O
processes, O
in O
prokaryotes O
and O
eukaryotes, O
and O
is O
an O
important O
intermediate O
of O
energy O
metabolism. O
Despite O
some O
differences O
in O
the O
details O
of O
their O
operation, O
many O
of O
these O
mechanisms O
have O
been O
preserved O
throughout O
evolution, O
demonstrating O
their O
fundamental O
importance. O
In O
particular, O
glycerol B-Chemical
can O
control O
osmotic O
activity O
and O
crystal O
formation O
and O
then O
act O
as O
a O
cryoprotective O
agent. O
Furthermore, O
its O
properties O
make O
it O
useful O
in O
numerous O
industrial, O
therapeutic O
and O
diagnostic O
applications. O
Few O
studies O
have O
focussed O
directly O
on O
glycerol, B-Chemical
however, O
and O
while O
its O
metabolism O
is O
increasingly O
well O
documented, O
much O
of O
the O
details O
remain O
unknown. O
Considering O
the O
importance O
of O
glycerol B-Chemical
in O
multiple O
vital O
physiological O
processes, O
its O
study O
could O
help O
unlock O
important O
physiopathological O
mechanisms. O
