# Abstract
Class O
I O
and O
class O
II O
aldolases O
are O
products O
of O
two O
evolutionary O
non-related O
gene O
families. O
The O
cytosol O
and O
chloroplast O
enzymes O
of O
higher O
plants O
are O
of O
the O
class O
I O
type, O
the O
latter O
being O
bifunctional O
for O
fructose-1,6- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
sedoheptulose-1,7-P2 I-Chemical
in O
the O
Calvin O
cycle. O
Recently, O
class O
II O
aldolases O
were O
detected O
for O
the O
cytosol O
and O
chloroplasts O
of O
the O
lower O
alga O
Cyanophora O
paradoxa. O
The O
respective O
chloroplast O
enzyme O
has O
been O
shown O
here O
to O
be O
also O
bifunctional O
for O
fructose-1,6- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
sedoheptulose-1,7-P2. I-Chemical
Kinetics, O
also O
including O
fructose-1-P, O
were O
determined O
for O
all O
these O
enzymes. O
Apparently, O
aldolases O
are O
multifunctional O
enzymes, O
irrespective O
of O
their O
class O
I O
or O
class O
II O
type. O
