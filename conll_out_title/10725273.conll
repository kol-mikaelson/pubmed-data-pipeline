1. O
We O
studied O
the O
functional O

3. O
Losartan B-Chemical

5. O
In O
conclusion, O
losartan B-Chemical
is O
transported O
by O
P-glycoprotein O
and O
other O
intestinal O
transporters, O
that O
do O
not O
include O
MRP-1 B-Gene
and O
MRP-2. B-Gene
In O
contrast, O
the O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolite O
is O
not O
a O
P-glycoprotein O
substrate, O
but O
displays O
considerably O
higher O
affinity O
for O
other O
transporters O
than O
losartan, B-Chemical
that O
again O
most O
probably O
do O
not O
include O
MRP-1 B-Gene
and O
MRP-2. B-Gene
