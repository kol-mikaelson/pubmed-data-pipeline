# Abstract
In O
recent O
years, O
much O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
unravelling O
of O
the O
functions O
of O
peroxisomes O
in O
metabolism, O
and O
it O
is O
now O
well O
established O
that O
peroxisomes O
are O
indispensable O
organelles, O
especially O
in O
higher O
eukaryotes. O
Peroxisomes O
catalyse O
a O
number O
of O
essential O
metabolic O
functions O
including O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation, O
ether B-Chemical
phospholipid I-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
alpha-oxidation O
and O
glyoxylate O
detoxification. O
The O
involvement O
of O
peroxisomes O
in O
these O
metabolic O
pathways O
necessitates O
the O
transport O
of O
metabolites O
in O
and O
out O
of O
peroxisomes. O
Recently, O
considerable O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
in O
the O
characterization O
of O
metabolite O
transport O
across O
the O
peroxisomal O
membrane. O
Peroxisomes O
posses O
several O
specialized O
transport O
systems O
to O
transport O
metabolites. O
This O
is O
exemplified O
by O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
specific O
transporter O
for O
adenine O
nucleotides O
and O
several O
half-ABC O
(ATP-binding O
cassette) O
transporters O
which O
may O
be O
present O
as O
hetero- O
and O
homo-dimers. O
The O
nature O
of O
the O
substrates O
handled O
by O
the O
different O
ABC O
transporters O
is O
less O
clear. O
In O
this O
review O
we O
will O
describe O
the O
current O
state O
of O
knowledge O
of O
the O
permeability O
properties O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
membrane. O
