# Abstract
Iodide B-Chemical
transport O
by O
thyrocytes O
is O
a O
two O
step O
process O
involving O
transporters O
located O
either O
in O
the O
basal O
or O
in O
the O
apical O
membranes O
of O
the O
cell. O
The O
sodium B-Gene
iodide B-Chemical
symporter I-Gene
(NIS) B-Gene
is O
localized O
in O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
facing O
the O
bloodstream O
and O
mediates O
iodide B-Chemical
accumulation O
into O
thyrocytes. O
Pendrin B-Gene
has O
been O
proposed O
as O
an O
apical O
transporter. O
In O
order O
to O
identify O
new O
iodide B-Chemical
transporters, I-Chemical
we O
developed O
a O
PCR O
cloning O
strategy O
based O
on O
NIS B-Gene
sequence O
homologies. O
From O
a O
human B-Species
kidney O
cDNA O
library, O
we O
characterized O
a O
gene, O
located O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
12q23, I-Chromosome
that O
encodes O
a O
610 O
amino O
acid O
protein O
sharing O
46% O
identity O
(70% O
similarity) O
with O
the O
human B-Species
NIS. B-Gene
Functional O
analysis O
of O
the O
protein O
expressed O
in O
mammalian O
cells O
indicates O
that O
it O
catalyzes O
a O
passive O
iodide B-Chemical
transport. O
The O
protein O
product O
was O
immunohistochemically O
localized O
at O
the O
apical O
pole O
of O
the O
thyroid O
cells O
facing O
the O
colloid O
lumen. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
this O
new O
identified O
protein O
mediates O
iodide B-Chemical
transport O
from O
the O
thyrocyte O
into O
the O
colloid O
lumen O
through O
the O
apical O
membrane. O
It O
was O
designated O
hAIT O
for O
human B-Species
Apical O
Iodide B-Chemical
Transporter. O
