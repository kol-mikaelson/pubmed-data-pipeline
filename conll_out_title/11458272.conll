The O

system. O

# Abstract
One O
of O
the O
major O
liver O
functions O
is O
the O
ability O
of O
hepatocytes O
to O
store O
glucose B-Chemical
in O
the O
form O
of O
glycogen B-Chemical
for O
various O
purposes. O
Beside O
glucose B-Chemical
production O
and O
secretion, O
the O
synthesis O
of O
glucuronides B-Chemical
and O
ascorbate B-Chemical
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
dependent O
on O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
glycogen B-Chemical
stores O
and O
on O
the O
rate O
of O
glycogenolysis O
in O
the O
liver. O
It O
is O
common O
that O
the O
final O
steps O
of O
these O
pathways O
are O
catalysed O
by O
intraluminally O
orientated O
enzymes O
of O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum, O
which O
are O
supported O
by O
transporters O
for O
the O
permeation O
of O
substrates O
and O
products. O
On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
close O
morphological O
and O
functional O
proximity O
of O
glycogen, B-Chemical
glycogen-dependent O
pathways O
and O
the O
(smooth) O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
we O
propose O
to O
use O
the O
term O
glycogenoreticular O
system O
for O
the O
description O
of O
this O
export-orientated O
hepatocyte-specific O
metabolic O
unit. O
