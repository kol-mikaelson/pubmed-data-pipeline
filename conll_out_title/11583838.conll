# Abstract
The O
quinoid B-Chemical
nucleus O
of O
the O
benzoquinone, B-Chemical
ubiquinone B-Chemical
(coenzyme B-Chemical
Q; B-Chemical
Q), B-Chemical
is O
derived O
from O
the O
shikimate B-Chemical
pathway O
in O
bacteria O
and O
eukaryotic O
microorganisms. O
Ubiquinone B-Chemical
is O
not O
considered O
a O
vitamin O
since O
mammals O
synthesize O
it O
from O
the O
essential O
amino O
acid O
tyrosine. B-Chemical
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
other O
Gram-negative O
bacteria O
derive O
the O
4-hydroxybenzoate B-Chemical
required O
for O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
Q B-Chemical
directly O
from O
chorismate. B-Chemical
The O
yeast, B-Species
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae, I-Species
can O
either O
form O
4-hydroxybenzoate B-Chemical
from O
chorismate B-Chemical
or O
tyrosine. B-Chemical
However, O
unlike O
mammals, O
S. B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
synthesizes O
tyrosine B-Chemical
in O
vivo O
by O
the O
shikimate B-Chemical
pathway. O
While O
the O
reactions O
of O
the O
pathway O
leading O
from O
4-hydroxybenzoate B-Chemical
to O
Q B-Chemical
are O
the O
same O
in O
both O
organisms O
the O
order O
in O
which O
they O
occur O
differs. O
The O
4-hydroxybenzoate B-Chemical
undergoes O
a O
prenylation, O
a O
decarboxylation O
and O
three O
hydroxylations O
alternating O
with O
three O
methylation O
reactions, O
resulting O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
Q. B-Chemical
The O
methyl O
groups O
for O
the O
methylation O
reactions O
are O
derived O
from O
S-adenosylmethionine. B-Chemical
While O
the O
prenyl O
side O
chain O
is O
formed O
by O
the O
2-C-methyl-D-erythritol B-Chemical
4-phosphate I-Chemical
(non-mevalonate) O
pathway O
in O
E. B-Species
coli, I-Species
it O
is O
formed O
by O
the O
mevalonate B-Chemical
pathway O
in O
the O
yeast. B-Species
