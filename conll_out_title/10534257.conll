# Abstract
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
determine O
CSF O
eicosanoid B-Chemical
concentrations O
and O
brain O
cyclo-oxygenase O
activity O
in O
AD B-Disease
patients B-Species
and O
age-matched O
control O
subjects. O
BACKGROUND: O
Nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
may O
benefit O
AD B-Disease
patients B-Species
by O
inhibiting O
cyclo-oxygenases O
and O
thereby O
reducing O
prostaglandin B-Chemical
(PG) O
production O
or O
oxidant O
stress O
in O
the O
CNS. O
METHODS: O
CSF O
eicosanoid B-Chemical
and O
F2-isoprostane B-Chemical
(IsoP) B-Chemical
levels O
were O
determined O
in O
seven O
probable O
AD B-Disease
patients B-Species
and O
seven O
age-matched O
control O
subjects. O
Cyclo-oxygenase O
activity O
was O
determined O
in O
microsomes O
prepared O
from O
the O
hippocampus O
of O
10 O
definite O
AD B-Disease
patients B-Species
and O
8 O
age-matched O
control O
subjects. O
All O
measurements O
were O
made O
using O
gas O
chromatography O
mass O
spectrometry. O
RESULTS: O
CSF O
concentrations O
of O
prostaglandin B-Chemical
(PG) I-Chemical
E2 I-Chemical
were O
increased O
fivefold O
(p O
< O
0.01) O
and O
6-keto-PGF1alpha B-Chemical
was O
decreased O
fourfold O

Cyclo-oxygenase O
activity O
in O
the O

was O
not O
different O
from O
age-matched O

CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
cyclo-oxygenase O
activity O
may O
not O
contribute O
significantly O
to O
CNS O
oxidative O
damage O
in O

Increased O

patients B-Species
suggest O
that O
cyclo-oxygenase O
inhibitors O
may O
benefit O
AD B-Disease
patients B-Species
by O
limiting O
PG O
production. O
