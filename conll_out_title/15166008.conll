# Abstract
Transplacental O
transfer O
is O
the O
fetus' O
primary O
source O
of O
taurine, B-Chemical
an O
essential O
amino O
acid O
during O
fetal O
life. O
In O
intrauterine B-Disease
growth I-Disease
restriction I-Disease
(IUGR), B-Disease
placental O
transport O
capacity O
of O
taurine B-Chemical
is O
reduced O
and O
fetal O
taurine B-Chemical
levels O
are O
decreased. O
We O
characterized O
the O
protein O
expression O
of O
the O
taurine B-Chemical
transporter I-Gene
(TAUT) B-Gene
in O
human B-Species
placenta O
using O
immunocytochemistry O
and O
Western O
blotting, O
tested O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
placental O
protein O
expression O
of O
TAUT B-Gene
is O
reduced O
in O
IUGR, B-Disease
and O
investigated O
TAUT B-Gene
regulation O
by O
measuring O
the O
Na(+)-dependent O
taurine B-Chemical
uptake O
in O
primary O
villous O
fragments O
after O
1 O
h O
of O
incubation O
with O
different O
effectors. O
TAUT B-Gene
was O
primarily O
localized O
in O
the O
syncytiotrophoblast O
microvillous O
plasma O
membrane O
(MVM). O
TAUT B-Gene
was O
detected O
as O
a O
single O
70-kDa O
band, O
and O
MVM O
TAUT B-Gene
expression O
was O
unaltered O
in O
IUGR. B-Disease
The O
PKC B-Gene
activator O
PMA B-Chemical
and O
the O
nitric B-Chemical
oxide I-Chemical
(NO) O
donor O
3-morpholinosydnonimine B-Chemical
decreased O
TAUT B-Gene
activity O
(P O
< O
0.05, O
n O
= O
7-15). O
However, O
none O
of O
the O
tested O
hormones, O
e.g., O
leptin B-Gene
and O
growth B-Gene
hormone, I-Gene
altered O
TAUT B-Gene
activity O
significantly. O
PKC B-Gene
activity O
measured O
in O
MVM O
from O
control O
and O
IUGR B-Disease
placentas O
was O
not O
different. O
In O
conclusion, O
syncytiotrophoblast O
TAUT B-Gene
is O
strongly O
polarized O
to O
the O
maternal-facing O
plasma O
membrane. O
MVM O
TAUT B-Gene
expression O
is O
unaltered O
in O
IUGR, B-Disease
suggesting O
that O
the O
reduced O
MVM O
taurine B-Chemical
transport O
in O
IUGR B-Disease
is O
due O
to O
changes O
in O
transporter O
activity. O
NO O
release O
downregulates O
placental O
TAUT B-Gene
activity, O
and O
it O
has O
previously O
been O
shown O
that O
IUGR B-Disease
is O
associated O
with O
increased O
fetoplacental O
NO O
levels. O
NO O
may O
therefore O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
downregulating O
MVM O
TAUT B-Gene
activity O
in O
IUGR. B-Disease
