# Abstract
Human B-Species
corneal B-Gene
N-acetylglucosamine I-Gene
6-O-sulfotransferase I-Gene
(hCGn6ST) B-Gene
has O
been O
identified O
by O
the O
positional O
candidate O
approach O
as O
the O
gene O
responsible O
for O
macular B-Disease
corneal I-Disease

(MCD). B-Disease
Because O

its O
high O

in O
MCD B-Disease
patients B-Species

and O
serum, O
hCGn6ST B-Gene
protein O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
sulfotransferase O
that O
catalyzes O
sulfation O
of O
GlcNAc B-Chemical
in O
keratan B-Chemical

In O
this O
report, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
enzymatic O
activity O
of O
hCGn6ST B-Gene
by O
expressing O
it O
in O
cultured O
cells. O
A O
lysate O
prepared O
from O
HeLa B-CellLine

hCGn6ST B-Gene
cDNA O

cells O

showed O
an O

of O
transferring O
sulfate B-Chemical
to O
C-6 O
of O
GlcNAc B-Chemical
of O
synthetic O
oligosaccharide B-Chemical

When O
hCGn6ST B-Gene
was O
expressed O
together O
with O
human B-Species
keratan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
Gal-6-sulfotransferase I-Gene
(hKSG6ST), B-Gene

highly O
sulfated O

detected O
by O
an O
anti-keratan O

These O
results O
indicate O
that O
hCGn6ST B-Gene
transfers O
sulfate B-Chemical
to O
C-6 O
of O
GlcNAc B-Chemical
in O

MCD B-Disease
patients B-Species
abolished O
enzymatic O

Moreover, O
mouse B-Species
intestinal B-Gene
GlcNAc I-Gene
6-O-sulfotransferase I-Gene
had O
the O
same O
activity O
as O
hCGn6ST. B-Gene
This O
observation O
suggests O
that O
mouse B-Species
intestinal B-Gene
GlcNAc I-Gene
6-O-sulfotransferase I-Gene
is O
the O
orthologue O
of O
hCGn6ST B-Gene
and O
functions O
as O
a O
sulfotransferase O
to O
produce O
keratan B-Chemical

the O
cornea. O
