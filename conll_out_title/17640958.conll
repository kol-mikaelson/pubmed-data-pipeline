# Abstract
Efflux O
transporters O
are O
responsible O
for O
the O
excretion O
of O
numerous O
xenobiotics O
and O
endobiotics O
and O
thus O
play O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
proper O
liver O
and O
kidney O
function. O
Nonalcoholic B-Disease
fatty I-Disease
liver I-Disease
diseases I-Disease
(NAFLDs) B-Disease
comprise O
a O
spectrum O
of O
disorders O
that O
range O
from O
simple B-Disease
fatty I-Disease
liver I-Disease
(SFL) B-Disease
to O
nonalcoholic B-Disease
steatohepatitis I-Disease
(NASH). B-Disease
Although O
the O
precise O
events O
leading O
to O
NAFLD B-Disease
are O
unclear, O
even O
less O
is O
known O
about O
the O
effects O
on O
efflux O
transporter O
expression O
and O
drug O
disposition. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
the O
effect O
of O
NAFLD B-Disease
on O
efflux O
transporter O
expression O
in O
rat B-Species
liver O
as O
well O
as O
on O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
(APAP) B-Chemical
metabolite O
excretion. O
To O
simulate O
SFL B-Disease
and O
NASH, B-Disease
rats B-Species
were O
fed O
either O
a O
high-fat O
(HF) O
or O
a O
methionine- B-Chemical
and O
choline-deficient O
(MCD) O
diet O
for O
8 O
weeks. O
In O
the O
livers O
of O
MCD O
rats, B-Species
there O
were O
striking O
increases O
in O
both O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
levels O
of O
multidrug B-Gene
resistance-associated I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(Mrp) I-Gene
3, I-Gene
Mrp4, B-Gene
and O
breast O
cancer O
resistance O
protein, O
as O
well O
as O
increased O
Mrp2 B-Gene
protein. O
After O
administration O
of O
a O
nontoxic O
dose O
of O
APAP, B-Chemical
biliary O
concentrations O
of O
APAP-sulfate, B-Chemical
APAP-glucuronide B-Chemical
(APAP-GLUC), B-Chemical
and O
APAP-glutathione B-Chemical
were O
reduced O
in O
MCD O
rats. B-Species
The O
effects O
of O
the O
HF O
diet O
on O
both O
transporter O
expression O
and O
APAP B-Chemical
disposition O
were O
by O
comparison O
far O
less O
dramatic O
than O
the O
MCD O
diet-induced O
alterations. O
Whereas O
APAP-sulfate B-Chemical
levels O
were O
also O
decreased O
in O
MCD O
rat B-Species
plasma, O
the O
levels O
of O
the O
Mrp3 B-Gene
substrate O
APAP-GLUC B-Chemical
were O
elevated. O
Urinary O
elimination O
of O
APAP B-Chemical
metabolites O
was O
identical O
between O
groups, O
except O
for O
APAP-GLUC, B-Chemical
the O
concentration O
of O
which O
was O
80% O
higher O
in O
MCD O
rats. B-Species
These O
studies O
correlate O
increased O
hepatic O
Mrp3 B-Gene
protein O
in O
the O
MCD O
model O
of O
NASH B-Disease
with O
increased O
urinary O
elimination O
of O
APAP-GLUC. B-Chemical
Furthermore, O
the O
proportional O
shift O
in O
elimination O
of O
APAP B-Chemical
metabolites O
from O
bile O
to O
urine O
indicates O
that O
MCD-induced O
alterations O
in O
efflux O
transporter O
expression O
can O
affect O
the O
route O
of O
drug O
elimination. O
