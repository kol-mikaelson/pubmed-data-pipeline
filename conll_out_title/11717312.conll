# Abstract
Hormone-sensitive B-Gene
lipase B-Gene
(HSL) B-Gene
is O
expressed O
predominantly O
in O
white O
and O
brown O
adipose O
tissue O
where O
it O
is O
believed O
to O
play O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
the O
lipolysis O
of O
stored O
triglycerides B-Chemical
(TG), B-Chemical
thereby O
providing O
the O
body O
with O
energy O
substrate O
in O
the O
form O
of O
free B-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(FFA). B-Chemical
From O
in O
vitro O
assays, O
HSL B-Gene
is O
known O
to O
hydrolyze O
TG, B-Chemical
diglycerides B-Chemical
(DG), O
cholesteryl B-Chemical
esters, I-Chemical
and O
retinyl B-Chemical
esters. I-Chemical
In O
the O
current O
study O
we O
have O
generated O
HSL B-Gene
knock-out O
mice B-Species
and O
demonstrate O
three O
lines O
of O
evidence O
that O
HSL B-Gene
is O
instrumental O
in O
the O
catabolism O
of O
DG O
in O
vivo. O
First, O
HSL B-Gene
deficiency O
in O
mice B-Species
causes O
the O
accumulation O
of O
DG O
in O
white O
adipose O
tissue, O
brown O
adipose O
tissue, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
cardiac O
muscle, O
and O
testis. O
Second, O
when O
tissue O
extracts O
were O
used O
in O
an O
in O
vitro O
lipase B-Gene
assay, O
a O
reduced O
FFA B-Chemical
release O
and O
the O
accumulation O
of O
DG O
was O
observed O
in O
HSL B-Gene
knock-out O
mice B-Species
which O
did O
not O
occur O
when O
tissue O
extracts O
from O
control O
mice B-Species
were O
used. O
Third, O
in O
vitro O
lipolysis O
experiments O
with O
HSL-deficient O
fat O
pads O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
isoproterenol-stimulated O
release O
of O
FFA B-Chemical
was O
decreased O
and O
DG O
accumulated O
intracellularly O
resulting O
in O
the O
essential O
absence O
of O
the O
isoproterenol-stimulated O
glycerol B-Chemical
formation O
typically O
observed O
in O
control O
fat O
pads. O
Additionally, O
the O
absence O
of O
HSL B-Gene
in O
white O
adipose O
tissue O
caused O
a O
shift O
of O
the O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
composition O
of O
the O
TG B-Chemical
moiety O
toward O
increased O
long O
chain O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
implying O
a O
substrate O
specificity O
of O
the O
enzyme O
in O
vivo. O
From O
these O
in O
vivo O
results O
we O
conclude O
that O
HSL B-Gene
is O
the O
rate-limiting O
enzyme O
for O
the O
cellular O
catabolism O
of O
DG O
in O
adipose O
tissue O
and O
muscle. O
