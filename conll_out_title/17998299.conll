# Abstract
Midazolam B-Chemical
is O
a O
potent O
benzodiazepine B-Chemical
derivative O
with O
sedative, O
hypnotic, O
anticonvulsant, O
muscle-relaxant, O
and O
anxiolytic O
activities. O
It O
undergoes O
oxidative O
metabolism O
catalyzed O
almost O
exclusively O
by O
the O
CYP3A O
subfamily O
to O
a O
major O
metabolite, O
1'-hydroxymidazolam, B-Chemical
which O
is O
equipotent O
to O
midazolam. B-Chemical
1'-Hydroxymidazolam B-Chemical
is O
subject O
to O
glucuronidation O
followed O
by O
renal O
excretion. O
To O
date, O
the O
glucuronidation O
of O
1'-hydroxymidazolam B-Chemical
has O
not O
been O
evaluated O
in O
detail. O
In O
the O
current O
study, O
we O
identified O
an O
unreported O
quaternary O
N-glucuronide, B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
the O
known O
O-glucuronide, B-Chemical
from O
incubations O
of O
1'-hydroxymidazolam B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
enriched O
with O
uridine B-Chemical
5'-diphosphoglucuronic I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(UDPGA). B-Chemical
The O
structure O
of O
the O
N-glucuronide B-Chemical
was O
confirmed O
by O
nuclear O
magnetic O
resonance O
analysis, O
which O
showed O
that O
glucuronidation O
had O
occurred O
at O
N-2 O
(the O
imidazole B-Chemical
nitrogen O
that O
is O
not O
a O
part O
of O
the O
benzodiazepine B-Chemical
ring). O
In O
a O
separate O
study, O
in O
which O
midazolam B-Chemical
was O
used O
as O
the O
substrate, O
an O
analogous O
N-glucuronide B-Chemical
also O
was O
detected O
from O
incubations O
with O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
UDPGA. B-Chemical
Investigation O
of O
the O
kinetics O
of O
1'-hydroxymidazolam B-Chemical
glucuronidation O

autoactivation O

(Hill O

n O

1.2-1.5). O
The O
apparent O
S(50) O
values O
for O
the O
formation O
of O
O- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
N-glucuronides I-Chemical
were O
43 O
and O
18 O
microM, O
respectively, O
and O
the O
corresponding O
apparent O
V(max) O
values O
were O
363 O
and O
21 O

Incubations O
with O
recombinant O
human B-Species
uridine O
diphosphate O
glucuronosyltransferases O
(UGTs) O
indicated O
that O
the O
O-glucuronidation O
was O
catalyzed O
by O
UGT2B4 B-Gene
and O
UGT2B7, B-Gene
whereas O
the O
N-glucuronidation O
was O
catalyzed O
by O
UGT1A4. B-Gene
Consistent O
with O
these O
observations, O
hecogenin, B-Chemical
a O
selective O
inhibitor O
of O
UGT1A4, B-Gene
selectively O
inhibited O
the O
N-glucuronidation, O
whereas O
diclofenac, B-Chemical
a O
potent O
inhibitor O
of O
UGT2B7, B-Gene
had O
a O
greater O
inhibitory O
effect O
on O
the O
O-glucuronidation O
than O
on O
the O
N-glucuronidation. O
In O
summary, O
our O
study O
provides O
the O
first O
demonstration O
of O
N-glucuronidation O
of O
1'-hydroxymidazolam B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes. O
