# Abstract
The O
cDNA O
for O
human B-Species
squalene B-Chemical
monooxygenase, I-Gene
a O
key O
enzyme O
in O
the O
committed O
pathway O
for O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
was O
amplified O
from O
a O
human B-Species
liver O
cDNA O
library O
and O
cloned, O
and O
the O
protein O
was O
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
purified. O
Kinetic O
analysis O
of O
the O
purified O
enzyme O
revealed O
an O
apparent O
K(m) O
for O
squalene B-Chemical
of O
7.7 O

and O
an O

For O
FAD B-Chemical
the O
apparent O
K(m) O
is O
0.3 O
microM, O
consistent O
with O
a O

The O
apparent O
K(m) O
for O
NADPH-cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
reductase, I-Gene
the O
requisite O
electron O
transfer O
partner, O
is O
14 O
nM. O
The O
amount O
of O
reductase O
needed O
for O
maximal O
activity O
is O
about O
threefold O
less O
than O
the O
amount O
of O
squalene B-Chemical
monooxygenase I-Gene
present O
in O
the O
assay; O
thus, O
electron O
transfer O
to O
the O
monooxygenase O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
rate O
limiting. O
Previous O
reports O
have O
implicated O
inhibition O
of O
this O
enzyme O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
a O
peripheral B-Disease
demyelination I-Disease
seen O
in O
weanling O
rats B-Species
fed O
a O
diet O
containing O
tellurium. B-Chemical
As O
no O
data O
were O
available O
for O
humans, B-Species
the O
ability O
of O
a O
number O
of O
tellurium B-Chemical
and O
related O
elemental O
compounds O
to O
inhibit O
the O
recombinant O
human B-Species
enzyme O
was O
examined. O
Tellurite, B-Chemical
tellurium B-Chemical
dioxide, I-Chemical
selenite, B-Chemical
and O
selenium B-Chemical
dioxide I-Chemical
were O
inhibitory; O
the O
tellurium B-Chemical
compounds O
were O
more O
potent O
than O
the O
selenium B-Chemical
compounds, O
as O
indicated O
by O
their O
IC(50) O
values O
(17 O
and O
37 O
microM, O
respectively). O
Kinetic O
analysis O
of O
the O
inhibition O
by O
tellurite B-Chemical
suggests O
multiple O
sites O
of O
interaction O
with O
the O
enzyme O
in O
a O
noncompetitive O
manner O
with O
respect O
to O
squalene. B-Chemical
