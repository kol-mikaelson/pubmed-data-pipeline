This O

describes O
the O
isolation O
of O
a O
heretofore O
uncharacterized O
aldehyde O

(ALDH) O
with O
retinal O

activity O
from O
rat B-Species

and O
the O
cloning O
and O
expression O
of O
a O
cDNA O
that O
encodes O
its O
human B-Species
ortholog, O
the O
previously O
unknown O
ALDH12. B-Gene
The O

cDNA O
predicts O
a O
487-residue O

ALDH12, B-Gene
however, O
has O
approximately O
40-fold O
higher O
activity O
with O
9-cis- B-Chemical
retinal I-Chemical
than O
with O
all-trans-retinal, B-Chemical
whereas O
RALDH1 B-Gene
and O
RALDH2 B-Gene
have O
equivalent O
and O
approximately O
4-fold O
less O
efficiencies O
for O
9-cis-retinal B-Chemical
versus O
all-trans-retinal, B-Chemical
respectively. O
Therefore, O
ALDH12 B-Gene
is O
the O
first O

show O
a O

9-cis-retinal B-Chemical

Evidence O

ALDH12 B-Gene
could O
function O

a O
