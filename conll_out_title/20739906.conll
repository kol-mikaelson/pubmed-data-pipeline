# Abstract
OBJECTIVES: O
Cerivastatin, B-Chemical
a O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme B-Gene
A I-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitor O
withdrawn O
from O
the O
market O
because O
of O
serious O
adverse O
effects, O
is O
metabolized O
primarily O
by O
CYP2C8. B-Gene
The O
occurrence O
of O
associated O
myotoxicity B-Disease
and O
rhabdomyolysis B-Disease
were O
attributed O
to O
altered O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics O
on O
account O
of O
gemfibrozil-inhibition O
or O
genetic O
variations O
in O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
and O
drug O
transporters O
involved O
in O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
clearance. O
However, O
the O
effect O
of O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
genetic O
variation O
on O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
metabolism O
has O
not O
been O
fully O
elucidated. O
METHODS: O
In O
this O
study, O
patients B-Species
(n=126) O
with O
confirmed O
cases O
of O
rhabdomyolysis B-Disease
after O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
administration O
had O
their O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
gene O
resequenced O
and O
the O
metabolism O
of O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
by O
the O
discovered O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
variants O
was O
assessed O
in O
proteins O
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli. I-Species
RESULTS: O
In O
this O
unique O
patient B-Species
population, O
12 O
novel O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphisms O
were O
discovered O
of O
which O
six O
were O
exclusively O
found O
in O
patients B-Species
not O
using O
gemfibrozil. B-Chemical
Three O
rare O
exonic O
variants O
resulted O
in O
amino O
acid O
substitutions O
and O
a O
frame O
shift O
deletion O
(V472fsL494 B-ProteinMutation
generating O
a O
defective O
mostly O
heme-free O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
protein). O
A O
particular O
promoter O
located O
deletion O
(-635_-634delTA) B-DNAMutation
was O
tightly O
linked O
to O
CYP2C8*3. O
Heterologously O
expressed O
CYP2C8.3 O
and O
CYP2C8.4 O
displayed O
an O
increase O
in O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
metabolic O
clearance O
of O
up O
to O
six-fold O
compared O
with O
the O
wild-type O
enzyme. O
Similarly, O
an O
independent O
sample O
of O
microsomes O
from O
human B-Species
livers O
carrying O
the O
CYP2C8*3 O
and O
CYP2C8*4 O
alleles O
exhibited O
a O
2-fold O
to O
14-fold O
increase O
in O
normalized O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
intrinsic O
clearance, O
compared O
with O
microsomes O
from O
livers O
carrying O
only O
the O
wild O

CONCLUSION: O
Gain O
or O
loss O
of O
catalytic O
function O
found O
in O
the O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
gene O
could O
certainly O
alter O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics O
and O
may O
influence, O
at O
least O
in O
part, O
susceptibility O
to O
the O
development O
of O
myotoxicity. B-Disease
