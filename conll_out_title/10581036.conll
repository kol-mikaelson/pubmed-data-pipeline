# Abstract
Sialic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
storage I-Disease
diseases I-Disease
(SASD, B-Disease
MIM B-Disease
269920) O
are O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
neurodegenerative I-Disease
disorders I-Disease
that O
may O
present O
as O
a O
severe O
infantile O
form O
(ISSD) B-Disease
or O
a O
slowly O
progressive O
adult O
form, O
which O
is O
prevalent O
in O
Finland O
(Salla B-Disease
disease). I-Disease
The O
main O
symptoms O
are O
hypotonia, B-Disease
cerebellar B-Disease
ataxia I-Disease
and O
mental B-Disease
retardation; I-Disease
visceromegaly B-Disease
and O
coarse O
features O
are O
also O
present O
in O
infantile O
cases. O
Progressive O
cerebellar B-Disease
atrophy I-Disease
and O
dysmyelination B-Disease
have O
been O
documented O
by O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
(ref. O
4). O
Enlarged O
lysosomes O
are O
seen O
on O
electron O
microscopic O
studies O
and O
patients B-Species
excrete O
large O
amounts O
of O
free O
sialic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
in O
urine. O
A O

mechanism O
for O
sialic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
glucuronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
impaired O
in O
lysosomal O
membranes O
from O
Salla O
and O
ISSD B-Disease
patients. B-Species
The O
locus O
for O
Salla B-Disease
disease I-Disease
was O
assigned O
to O
a O
region O
of O
approximately O
200 O
kb O
on O
chromosome O
6q14-q15 O
in O
a O
linkage O
study O
using O
Finnish O
families. O
Salla B-Disease
disease I-Disease
and O
ISSD B-Disease
were O
further O
shown O
to O
be O
allelic B-Disease
disorders. I-Disease
A O
physical O
map O
with O
P1 O
and O
PAC O
clones O
was O
constructed O
to O
cover O
the O
200-kb O
area O
flanked O
by O
the O
loci O
D6S280 O
and O
D6S1622, O
providing O
the O
basis O
for O
precise O
physical O
positioning O
of O
the O
gene. O
Here O
we O
describe O
a O
new O
gene, O
SLC17A5 B-Gene
(also O
known O
as O
AST), B-Gene
encoding O
a O
protein O
(sialin) B-Gene
with O
a O
predicted O
transport O
function O
that O
belongs O
to O
a O
family O
of O
anion O
cation O
symporters O
(ACS). O
We O
found O
a O
homozygous O
SLC17A5 B-Gene
mutation O
(R39C) B-ProteinMutation
in O
five O
Finnish O
patients B-Species
with O
Salla B-Disease
disease I-Disease
and O
six O
different O
SLC17A5 B-Gene
mutations O
in O
six O
ISSD B-Disease
patients B-Species
of O
different O
ethnic O
origins. O
Our O
observations O
suggest O
that O
mutations O
in O
SLC17A5 B-Gene
are O
the O
primary O
cause O
of O
lysosomal B-Disease
sialic I-Disease
acid I-Disease
storage I-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
