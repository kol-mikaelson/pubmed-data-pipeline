# Abstract
P450c17 B-Gene
(17alpha-hydroxylase O
17,20-lyase) O
catalyzes O
steroid B-Chemical
17alpha-hydroxylase O
and O
17,20-lyase O
activities O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
androgens O
and O
estrogens. O
These O
two O
activities O
are O
differentially O
regulated O
in O
a O
tissue-specific O
and O
developmentally O
programmed O
manner. O

The O

The O

PROCHECK, O

that O
the O

P450c17 B-Gene

reasonable. O
The O

both O

The O

The O

lysine B-ProteinMutation

would O
disrupt O
17,20-lyase O
activity O
to O
a O
greater O
extent O
than O
17alpha-hydroxylase O
activity; O
expression O
of O
a O
test O
mutant, O
K89N, B-ProteinMutation

yeast B-Species
confirmed O
this O
prediction. O

Our O
present O
model O

biochemical O

suggest O
that O
both O
the O

proceed O
from O
a O

by O
an O
