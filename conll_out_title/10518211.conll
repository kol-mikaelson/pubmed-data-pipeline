# Abstract
While O
intestinal O
transport O
systems O
for O
metabolites O
such O
as O
carbohydrates B-Chemical
have O
been O
well O
characterized, O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(FA) O
transport O
across O
the O
apical O
plasmalemma O
of O
enterocytes O
have O
remained O
largely O
unclear. O
Here, O
we O
show O
that O
FATP4, B-Gene
a O
member O
of O
a O
large O
family O
of O
FA O
transport O
proteins O
(FATPs), O
is O
expressed O
at O
high O
levels O
on O
the O
apical O
side O
of O
mature O
enterocytes O
in O
the O
small O
intestine. O
Further, O
overexpression O
of O
FATP4 B-Gene
in O
293 B-CellLine
cells O
facilitates O
uptake O
of O
long O
chain O
FAs O
with O
the O
same O
specificity O
as O
enterocytes, O
while O
reduction O
of O
FATP4 B-Gene
expression O
in O
primary O
enterocytes O
by O
antisense O
oligonucleotides O
inhibits O
FA O
uptake O
by O
50%. O
This O
suggests O
that O
FATP4 B-Gene
is O
the O
principal O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporter O
in O
enterocytes O
and O
may O
constitute O
a O
novel O
target O
for O
antiobesity O
therapy. O
