# Abstract
ACE2, B-Gene
the O
first O
known O
human B-Species
homologue O
of O
angiotensin-converting B-Gene
enzyme I-Gene
(ACE), B-Gene
was O
identified O
from O
5' O
sequencing O
of O
a O
human B-Species
heart B-Disease
failure I-Disease
ventricle O
cDNA O
library. O
ACE2 B-Gene
has O
an O
apparent O
signal O
peptide, O
a O
single O
metalloprotease O
active O
site, O
and O
a O
transmembrane O
domain. O
The O
metalloprotease O
catalytic O
domains O
of O
ACE2 B-Gene
and O
ACE B-Gene
are O
42% O
identical, O
and O
comparison O
of O
the O
genomic O
structures O
indicates O
that O
the O
two O
genes O
arose O
through O
duplication. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
more O
ubiquitous O
ACE, B-Gene
ACE2 B-Gene
transcripts O
are O
found O
only O
in O
heart, O
kidney, O
and O
testis O
of O
23 O
human B-Species
tissues O
examined. O
Immunohistochemistry O
shows O
ACE2 B-Gene
protein O
predominantly O
in O
the O
endothelium O
of O
coronary O
and O
intrarenal O
vessels O
and O
in O
renal O
tubular O
epithelium. O
Active O
ACE2 B-Gene
enzyme O
is O
secreted O
from O
transfected O
cells O
by O
cleavage O
N-terminal O
to O
the O
transmembrane O
domain. O
Recombinant O
ACE2 B-Gene
hydrolyzes O
the O
carboxy O
terminal O
leucine B-Chemical
from O
angiotensin B-Gene
I I-Gene
to O
generate O
angiotensin O
1-9, O
which O
is O
converted O
to O
smaller O
angiotensin B-Chemical
peptides I-Chemical
by O
ACE B-Gene
in O
vitro O
and O
by O
cardiomyocytes O
in O
culture. O
ACE2 B-Gene
can O
also O
cleave O
des-Arg B-Chemical
bradykinin I-Chemical
and O
neurotensin O
but O
not O
bradykinin O
or O
15 O
other O
vasoactive O
and O
hormonal O
peptides O
tested. O
ACE2 B-Gene
is O
not O
inhibited O
by O
lisinopril B-Chemical
or O
captopril. B-Chemical
The O
organ- O
and O
cell-specific O
expression O
of O
ACE2 B-Gene
and O
its O
unique O
cleavage O
of O
key O
vasoactive O
peptides O
suggest O
an O
essential O
role O
for O
ACE2 B-Gene
in O
the O
local O
renin-angiotensin O
system O
of O
the O
heart O
and O
kidney. O
