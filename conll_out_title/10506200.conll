# Abstract
Differences O
in O
glycolipid B-Chemical
expression O
between O
species O
contribute O
to O
the O
tropism O
of O
many O
infectious B-Disease
pathogens O
for O
their O
hosts. O
For O
example, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
cultured O
human B-Species
and O
monkey B-Species
urinary O
epithelial O
cells O
fail O
to O
bind O
a O
canine B-Species
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
uropathogenic O
isolate; O
however, O
transfection O
of O
these O
cells O
with O
the O
canine B-Species
Forssman O
synthetase O
(FS) O
cDNA O
enables O
abundant O
adherence O
by O
the O
same O
pathogen, O
indicating O
that O
addition O
of O
a O
single O
sugar B-Chemical
residue O
to O
a O
glycolipid B-Chemical
receptor O
has O
marked O
effects O
on O
microbial O
attachment. O
Given O
the O
contribution O
of O
glycolipids B-Chemical
to O
host-microbial O
interactions, O
we O
sought O
to O
determine O
why O
human B-Species
tissues O
do O
not O
express O
Forssman B-Chemical
glycolipid. I-Chemical
Query O
of O
the O
GenBank(TM) O
data O
base O
yielded O
a O
human B-Species
sequence O
with O
high O
identity O
to O
the O
canine B-Species
FS O
cDNA. O
Reverse O
transcription O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
and O
Northern O
blotting O
demonstrated O
the O
presence O
of O
FS O
mRNA O
in O
all O
tissues O
examined. O
A O
human B-Species
FS O
cDNA O
was O
characterized, O
revealing O
identities O
with O
the O
canine B-Species
FS O
gene O
of O
86 O
and O
83% O
at O
the O
nucleotide O
and O
predicted O
amino O
acid O
sequences, O
respectively. O
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
canine B-Species
FS O
cDNA, O
transfection O
of O
COS-1 B-CellLine
cells O
with O
the O
human B-Species
FS O
cDNA O
resulted O
in O
no O
detectable O
FS O
enzyme O
activity. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
variability O
in O
glycolipid B-Chemical
synthesis O
between O
species O
is O
an O
important O
determinant O
of O
microbial O
tropism. O
Evolutionary O
pressure O
from O
pathogenic O
organisms O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
diversity O
in O
glycolipid B-Chemical
expression O
among O
species. O
