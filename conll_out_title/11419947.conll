# Abstract
The O
lactose B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
(LS) B-Gene
enzyme O
is O
a O
1:1 O
complex O
of O
a O
catalytic O
component, O
beta1,4-galactosyltransferse O
(beta4Gal-T1) B-Gene
and O
a O
regulatory O
component, O
alpha-lactalbumin B-Gene
(LA), O
a O
mammary O
gland-specific O
protein. O
LA O
promotes O
the O
binding O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
(Glc) B-Chemical
to O
beta4Gal-T1, B-Gene
thereby O
altering O
its O
sugar B-Chemical
acceptor O
specificity O
from O
N-acetylglucosamine B-Chemical
(GlcNAc) B-Chemical
to O
glucose, B-Chemical
which O
enables O
LS B-Gene
to O
synthesize O
lactose, B-Chemical
the O
major O
carbohydrate B-Chemical
component O
of O
milk. O
The O
crystal O
structures O
of O
LS B-Gene
bound O
with O
various O
substrates O
were O
solved O
at O
2 O
A O
resolution. O
These O
structures O
reveal O
that O
upon O
substrate O
binding O
to O
beta4Gal-T1, B-Gene
a O
large O
conformational O
change O
occurs O
in O
the O
region O
comprising O
residues O
345 O
to O
365. O
This O
repositions O
His347 O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
it O
can O
participate O
in O
the O
coordination O
of O
a O
metal B-Chemical
ion, O
and O
creates O
a O
sugar B-Chemical
and O
LA-binding O
site. O
At O
the O
sugar-acceptor O
binding O
site, O
a O
hydrophobic O
N-acetyl O
group-binding O
pocket O
is O
found, O
formed O
by O
residues O
Arg359, O
Phe360 O
and O
Ile363. O
In O
the O
Glc-bound O
structure, O
this O
hydrophobic O
pocket O
is O
absent. O
For O
the O
binding O
of O
Glc B-Chemical
to O
LS, B-Gene
a O
reorientation O
of O
the O
Arg359 O
side-chain O
occurs, O
which O
blocks O
the O
hydrophobic O
pocket O
and O
maximizes O
the O
interactions O
with O
the O
Glc B-Chemical
molecule. O
Thus, O
the O
role O
of O
LA O
is O
to O
hold O
Glc B-Chemical
by O
hydrogen B-Chemical
bonding O
with O
the O
O-1 O
hydroxyl O
group O
in O
the O
acceptor-binding O
site O
on O
beta4Gal-T1, B-Gene
while O
the O
N-acetyl O
group-binding O
pocket O
in O
beta4Gal-T1 B-Gene
adjusts O
to O
maximize O
the O
interactions O
with O
the O
Glc B-Chemical
molecule. O
This O
study O
provides O
details O
of O
a O
structural O
basis O
for O
the O
partially O
ordered O
kinetic O
mechanism O
proposed O
for O
lactose B-Gene
synthase. I-Gene
