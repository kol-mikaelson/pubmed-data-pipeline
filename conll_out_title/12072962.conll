# Abstract
Human B-Species
kidney O
diamine B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
has O
been O
overexpressed O
as O
a O
secreted O
enzyme O
under O
the O
control O
of O
a O
metallothionein B-Gene
promoter O
in O
Drosophila B-Species
S2 B-CellLine
cell O
culture. O
This O
represents O
the O
first O
heterologous O
overexpression O
and O
purification O
of O
a O
catalytically O
active, O
recombinant O
mammalian B-Species
copper-containing O
amine O
oxidase. O
A O

allows O
for O
the O
recovery O
of O
large O
quantities O
of O
the O
recombinant O
enzyme, O
which O
is O
judged O
to O
be O
greater O
than O
98% O
homogenous O
by O
SDS B-Chemical
PAGE. O
The O
availability O
of O
large O
quantities O
of O
highly O
purified O
enzyme O
makes O
it O
now O
possible O
to O
investigate O
the O
spectroscopic, O
mechanistic, O
functional, O
and O
structural O
properties O
of O
this O
human B-Species
enzyme O
at O
the O
molecular O
level. O
Visible O
absorption, O
circular O
dichroism, O
electron O
paramagnetic O
resonance, O
and O
resonance O
Raman O
spectroscopic O
results O
are O
presented. O
The O
recombinant O
enzyme O
contains O
the O
cofactors O
2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalaninequinone B-Chemical
and O
copper B-Chemical
at O
stoichiometries O
of O
up O
to O
1.1 O
and O
1.5 O
mol O
per O
mol O
homodimer, O
respectively. O
In O
addition, O
tightly O
bound O
and O
stoichiometric O
calcium B-Chemical
ions O
were O
identified O
and O
proposed O
to O
occupy O
a O
second O
metal-binding O
site. O
The O
apparent O
molecular O
weight O
of O
the O
recombinant O
protein, O
determined O
by O
analytical O
ultracentrifugation, O
suggests O
20-26% O
glycosylation O
by O
weight. O
Detailed O
kinetic O
studies O
indicate O
the O
preferred O
substrates O
(k(cat) O
K(M)) O
of O
human B-Species
diamine B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
are, O
in O
order, O
histamine, B-Chemical
1-methylhistamine, B-Chemical
and O
putrescine, B-Chemical
with O
K(M) O
values O
of O
2.8, O
3.4, O
and O
20 O
microM, O
respectively. O
These O
results, O
demonstrating O
the O
substrate O
preference O
for O
histamine B-Chemical
and O
1-methylhistamine, B-Chemical
were O
unanticipated O
given O
the O
available O
literature. O
The O
pH O
dependence O
of O
k(cat) O
for O
putrescine B-Chemical
oxidation O
gives O
two O
apparent O
p O
K(a) O
values O
at O
6.0 O
and O
8.2. O
Tissue-specific O
expression O
of O
the O
human B-Species
diamine B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
gene O
was O
investigated O
using O
an O
mRNA O
array. O
The O
relevance O
of O
this O
work O
to O
earlier O
work O
and O
the O
suggested O
physiological O
roles O
of O
the O
human B-Species

are O
discussed. O
