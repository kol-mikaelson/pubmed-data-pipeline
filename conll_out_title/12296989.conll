# Abstract
1. O
The O
stereoselective O
metabolism O
and O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
the O
enantiomers O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
have O
been O
investigated O
following O
the O
oral O
administration O
of O
the O
racemic O
drug O
(400 O
mg) O
to O
12 O
healthy O
volunteers.2. O
The O
stereochemical O
composition O
of O
the O
drug O
in O
serum, O
both O
total O
and O
unbound, O
and O
drug O
and O
metabolites, O
both O
free O
and O
conjugated, O
in O
urine O
were O
determined O
by O
a O
combination O
of O
the O
direct O
and O
indirect O
chromatographic O
procedures O
to O
enantiomeric O
analysis. O
3. O
The O
oral O
clearance O
of O
(S)-ibuprofen B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
greater O
than O

ibuprofen, B-Chemical
2-hydroxyibuprofen B-Chemical

with O
glucuronic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Analysis O
of O
the O
stereochemical O
composition O

indicated O
that O
68% O

inversion. O
5. O
Metabolism O
via O
glucuronidation O
and O
both O

of O
oxidation, O
showed O

respectively.6. O
Modest O

observed O
in O
the O
formation O
