# Abstract
We O
isolated O
a O
cDNA O
for O
the O
human B-Species
homologue O
of O
system O
asc B-Gene
transporter O
Asc-1 B-Gene
from O
human B-Species
brain. O
The O
encoded O
protein O
designated O
as O
hAsc-1 B-Gene
(human B-Species
Asc-1) B-Gene
exhibited O
91 O
% O
sequence O
identity O
to O
mouse B-Species
Asc-1. B-Gene
Consistent O
with O
mouse B-Species
Asc-1, B-Gene
hAsc-1 B-Gene
required O
4F2 B-Gene
heavy O
chain O
for O
its O
functional O
expression O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
oocytes. O
hAsc-1 B-Gene
exhibited O
the O
properties O
of O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
asc B-Gene
which O
transports O
small O
neutral B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
in O
a O
Na(+)-independent O
manner. O
hAsc-1 B-Gene
transported O
D-serine B-Chemical
at O
high O
affinity O
with O
a O
K(m) O

In O
brain, O
2.0 O

hAsc-1 B-Gene
gene O
was O
mapped O
to O
human B-Species
chromosome B-Chromosome

region O
q12-q13.1. O
Because O
of O
the O
high-affinity O
transport O
with O
the O
K(m) O
value O
close O
to O
the O

of O
D-serine, B-Chemical
together O
with O
the O
high O
levels O
of O
expression O
in O
brain, O
hAsc-1 B-Gene
is O
proposed O
to O
play O
significant O
roles O
in O
the O
D-serine B-Chemical
mobilization O
in O
brain. O
