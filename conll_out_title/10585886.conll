# Abstract
The O
dicarboxylate B-Gene
carrier I-Gene
(DIC) B-Gene
is O
a O
nuclear-encoded O
protein O
located O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
inner O
membrane. O
It O
catalyses O
the O
transport O
of O
dicarboxylates B-Chemical
such O
as O
malate B-Chemical
and O
succinate B-Chemical
across O
the O
mitochondrial O
membrane O
in O
exchange O
for O
phosphate, B-Chemical
sulphate B-Chemical
and O
thiosulphate. B-Chemical
We O
have O
determined O
the O
sequences O
of O
the O
human B-Species
cDNA O
and O

for O
the O

upon O
the O

It O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
by O
Northern- O

Western-blot O
analyses O
that O
the O
DIC B-Gene
is O
present O
in O

amounts O
in O
liver O
and O
kidney, O

in O

analysed. O
The O
