# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Statins O
are O
widely O
used O
to O
reduce O
blood O
levels O
of O
low-density O
lipoprotein-cholesterol O
(LDL-C). O
Each O
statin O
has O
unique O
pharmacokinetic O
properties; O
lipophilicity O
is O
one O
such O
property O
and O
relates O
to O
tissue O
selectivity. O
METHODS O
AND O

To O
clarify O
whether O
statin O
lipophilicity O
affects O
prognosis, O
a O
post O
hoc O
analysis O
of O
the O
MUSASHI-AMI O
database O
was O
performed. O
Patients B-Species
who O
were O
assigned O
to O
receive O
statin O
were O
separated O
into O
2 O
groups O
according O
to O
the O
lipophilicity O
of O
the O
statins O
they O
were O
administered: O
lipophilic O
statins O
(atorvastatin, B-Chemical
fluvastatin, B-Chemical
pitavastatin B-Chemical
and O
simvastatin; B-Chemical
LS O
group; O
n=131) O
or O
hydrophilic O
statins O
(pravastatin; B-Chemical
HS O
group; O
n=110). O
There O
was O
no O
difference O
in O
baseline O
LDL-C O
concentrations O
between O
the O
2 O
groups. O
Although O
LDL-C O
was O
decreased O
more O
potently O
in O
the O
LS O
than O
HS O
groups O
(-34% O
vs O
-19%; O
p=0.0069), O
acute B-Disease

events O
tended O
to O
occur O
less O
frequently O
(3.6% O
vs O
9.9%; O
p=0.0530) O
and O
the O
incidence O
of O
new O
Q-wave O

in O
electrocardiogram O
was O
significantly O
lower O
(75% O
vs O

p=0.0056) O
in O
the O
HS O

LS O
groups. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
In O
normocholesterolemic O
Japanese O
patients B-Species
after O
AMI, B-Disease
hydrophilic O
pravastatin B-Chemical
could O
be O
superior O
to O
lipophilic O
statins O
at O

events. O
