# Abstract
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
study O
whether O
oat B-Chemical
bran I-Chemical
with O
native O
beta-glucans B-Chemical
increases O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
excretion O
and O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthesis O
as O
measured O
by O
serum O
concentrations O
of O
7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one B-Chemical
(7alpha-HC). B-Chemical
DESIGN: O
Short-term O
interventional O
crossover O
study O
evaluating O
cholesterol B-Chemical
absorption, O
ileal O
excretion O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
bile B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
and O
serum O
levels O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolites. O
Differences O
between O
diets O
evaluated O
with O
Wilcoxon's O
signed O
rank-sum O
test. O
SETTING: O
Outpatients O
at O
a O
metabolic-ward O
kitchen. O
SUBJECTS: O
Nine O
volunteers O
with O
conventional O
ileostomies. O
METHODS: O
Two O
3-day-diet O
periods, O
with O
controlled, O
blinded O
basal O
diet O
including O
75 O
g O
extruded O
oat B-Chemical
bran I-Chemical
breakfast O
cereal O
daily, O
with O
either O
11.6 O
g O
native O
or O
hydrolysed O
beta-glucans. B-Chemical
RESULTS: O
Native O
oat B-Chemical
bran I-Chemical
increased O
median O
excretion O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
by O
144% O
(P=0.008). O
Cholesterol B-Chemical
excretion O
remained O
unchanged, O
cholesterol B-Chemical
absorption O
decreased O
by O
19% O
(P=0.013), O
whereas O
the O
sum O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
cholesterol B-Chemical
excretion O
increased O
by O
40% O
(P=0.008) O
compared O
with O
hydrolysed O
oat B-Chemical
bran. I-Chemical
7alpha-HC B-Chemical
reflecting O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthesis O
increased O
by O
57% O
(P=0.008) O
within O
24 O
h O
of O
consumption, O
whereas O
serum O
lathosterol B-Chemical
concentration O

cholesterol B-Chemical

increased O
by O
12% O
(P=0.015). O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Oat B-Chemical
bran I-Chemical
with O
native O
beta-glucans B-Chemical
increases O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
excretion O
within O
24 O
h O
of O
consumption O
and O
this O
increase O
can O
also O
be O
detected O
by O
rising O
serum O
concentrations O
of O
7alpha-HC. B-Chemical
Thus, O
7alpha-HC B-Chemical
could O
be O
used O
for O
rapid O
detection O
of O
dietary O
effects O
on O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism. O
These O
effects O
could O
possibly O
be O
explained O
by O
entrapment O
of O
whole O
micelles O
in O
the O
gut O
owing O
to O
higher O
viscosity. O
