# Abstract
Accumulated O
recent O
evidence O
is O
indicating O
that O
alternative O
splicing O
represents O
a O
generalized O
process O
that O
increases O
the O
complexity O
of O
human B-Species
gene O
expression. O
Here O
we O
show O
that O
mRNA O
production O
may O
not O
necessarily O
be O
limited O
to O
single O
genes, O
as O
human B-Species
liver O
also O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
produce O
a O
variety O
of O
hybrid O
cytochrome O
P450 O
3A O
mRNA O
molecules. O
The O
four O
known O
cytochrome O
P450 O
3A O
genes O
in O
humans, B-Species
CYP3A4, B-Gene
CYP3A5, B-Gene
CYP3A7, B-Gene
and O
CYP3A43, B-Gene
share O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
similarity, O
consist O
of O
13 O
exons O
with O
conserved O
exon-intron O
boundaries, O
and O
form O
a O
cluster O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
7. I-Chromosome
The O
chimeric O
CYP3A B-Gene
mRNA O
molecules O
described O
herein O
are O
characterized O
by O
CYP3A43 B-Gene
exon O
1 O
joined O
at O
canonical O
splice O
sites O
to O
distinct O
sets O
of O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
or O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
exons. O
Because O
the O
CYP3A43 B-Gene
gene O
is O
in O
a O
head-to-head O
orientation O
with O
the O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
and O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
genes, O
bypassing O
transcriptional O
termination O
can O
not O
account O
for O
the O
formation O
of O
hybrid O
CYP3A B-Gene
mRNAs. O
Thus, O
the O
mechanism O
generating O
these O
molecules O
has O
to O
be O
an O
RNA O
processing O
event O
that O
joins O
exons O
of O
independent O
pre-mRNA O
molecules, O
i.e. O
trans-splicing. O
Using O
quantitative O
real-time O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction, O
the O
ratio O
of O
one O
CYP3A43 B-Gene
3A4 O
intergenic O
combination O
was O
estimated O
to O
be O
approximately O
0.15% O
that O
of O
the O
CYP3A43 B-Gene
mRNAs. O
Moreover, O
trans-splicing O
has O
been O
found O
not O
to O
interfere O
with O
polyadenylation. O
