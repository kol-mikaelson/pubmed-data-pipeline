# Abstract
We O
report O
here O
on O
the O
cloning O
and O
functional O
characterization O
of O
the O
third O
subtype O
of O
amino B-Chemical
acid I-Disease
transport I-Disease
system I-Disease
A, I-Disease
designated O
ATA3 B-Gene
(amino B-Chemical
acid I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
A3), I-Gene
from O
a O
human B-Species
liver O
cell O
line. O
This O
transporter O
consists O
of O
547 O
amino B-Chemical
acids O
and O
is O
structurally O
related O
to O
the O
members O
of O
the O
glutamine O
transporter O
family. O
The O
human B-Species
ATA3 B-Gene
(hATA3) O
exhibits O
88% O
identity O
in O
amino B-Chemical
acid O
sequence O
with O
rat B-Species
ATA3. B-Gene
The O
gene O
coding O
for O
hATA3 O
contains O
16 O
exons O
and O
is O
located O
on O
human B-Species
chromosome B-Chromosome
12q13. I-Chromosome
It O
is O
expressed O
almost O
exclusively O
in O
the O
liver. O
hATA3 O
mediates O
the O
transport O
of O
neutral O
amino B-Chemical
acids O
including O
alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(MeAIB), O
the O
model O
substrate O
for O
system O
A, O
in O
a O
Na(+)-coupled O
manner O
and O
the O
transport O
of O
cationic O
amino B-Chemical
acids O
in O
a O
Na(+)-independent O
manner. O
The O
affinity O
of O
hATA3 O
for O
cationic O
amino B-Chemical
acids O
is O
higher O
than O
for O
neutral O
amino B-Chemical
acids. O
The O
transport O
function O
of O
hATA3 O
is O
thus O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
system O
y(+)L. O
The O
ability O
of O
hATA3 O
to O
transport O
cationic O
amino B-Chemical
acids O
with O
high O
affinity O
is O
unique O
among O
the O
members O
of O
the O
glutamine O
transporter O
family. O
hATA1 O
and O
hATA2, O
the O
other O
two O
known O
members O
of O
the O
system O
A O
subfamily, O
show O
little O
affinity O
toward O
cationic O
amino B-Chemical
acids. O
hATA3 O
also O
differs O
from O
hATA1 O
and O
hATA2 O
in O
exhibiting O
low O
affinity O
for O
MeAIB. O
Since O
liver O
does O
not O
express O
any O
of O
the O
previously O
known O
high-affinity O
cationic O
amino B-Chemical
acid O
transporters, O
ATA3 B-Gene
is O
likely O
to O
provide O
the O
major O
route O
for O
the O
uptake O
of O
arginine O
in O
this O
tissue. O
