# Abstract
The O
formation O
of O
ursodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
the O
7 O
beta-hydroxy O
epimer B-Chemical
of O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
was O
investigated O
in O
three O
subjects O
with O
cerebrotendinous B-Disease
xanthomatosis I-Disease
and O
in O
four O
subjects O
with O
gallstones. B-Disease
Total O
biliary O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
composition O
was O
analyzed O
by O
gas-liquid O
chromatography O
before O
and O
after O
4 O
months O
of O
treatment O
with O
0.75 O
g O
day O
of O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Individual O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
identified O
by O
mass O
spectrometry. O
Before O
treatment, O
bile O
from O
cerebrotendinous B-Disease
xanthomatosis I-Disease
(CTX) B-Disease
subjects O
contained O
cholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
85%; O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
7%; O
deoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
3%; O
allocholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
3%; O
and O
unidentified O
steroids, B-Chemical
2%; O
while O
bile O
from O
gallstone B-Disease
subjects O
contained O
cholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
45%; O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
43%; O
deoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
11%, O
and O
lithocholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
1%. O
In O
all O
subjects, O
4 O
months O
of O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
therapy O
increased O
the O
proportion O
of O
this O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
approximately O
80% O
and O
decreased O
cholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
3% O
of O
the O
total O
biliary O
bile B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
the O
remaining O
17% O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
identified O
as O
ursodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
After O
the O
intravenous O
injection O
of O
[3H]chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
the O
specific O
activity O
of O
biliary O
ursodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
exceeded O
the O
specific O
activity O
of O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
the O
resulting O
specific O
activity O
decay O
curves O
suggested O
precursor-product O
relationships. O
When O
[3H]7-ketolithocholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
was O
administrated O
to O
another O
patient B-Species
treated O
with O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
radioactivity O
was O
detected O
in O
both O
the O
ursodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
fractions. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
substantial O
amounts O
of O
ursodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
are O
formed O
in O
patients B-Species
treated O
with O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
The O
ursodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
was O
synthesized O
from O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
presumably O
via O
7-ketolithocholic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
