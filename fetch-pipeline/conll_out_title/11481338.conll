# Abstract
In O
this O
report, O
we O
identify O
the O
human B-Species
DL-methylmalonyl-CoA B-Gene
racemase I-Gene
gene O
by O
analyzing O
prokaryotic O
gene O
arrangements O
and O
extrapolating O
the O
information O
obtained O
to O
human B-Species
genes O
by O
homology O
searches. O
Sequence O
similarity O
searches O
were O
used O
to O
identify O
two O
groups O
of O
homologues O
that O
were O
frequently O
arranged O
with O
prokaryotic O
methylmalonyl-CoA B-Gene
mutase I-Gene
genes, O
and O
that O
were O
of O
unknown O
function. O
Both O
gene O
groups O
had O
homologues O
in O
the O
human B-Species
genome. O
Because O
methylmalonyl-CoA O
mutases O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
propionyl-CoA, B-Chemical
we O
inferred O
that O
conserved O
neighbors O
of O
methylmalonyl-CoA B-Gene
mutase I-Gene
genes O
and O
their O
human B-Species
homologues O
were O
also O
involved O
in O
this O
process. O
Subsequent O
biochemical O
studies O
confirmed O
this O
inference O
by O
showing O
that O
the O
prokaryotic O
gene O
PH0272 O
and O
its O
human B-Species
homologue O
both O
encode O
DL-methylmalonyl-CoA O
racemases. O
To O
our O
knowledge O
this O
is O
the O
first O
report O
in O
which O
the O
function O
of O
a O
eukaryotic O
gene O
was O
determined O
based O
on O
the O
analysis O
of O
prokaryotic O
gene O
arrangements. O
Importantly, O
such O
analyses O
are O
rapid O
and O
may O
be O
generally O
applicable O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
human B-Species
genes O
that O
lack O
homologues O
of O
known O
function O
or O
that O
have O
been O
misidentified O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
sequence O
similarity O
searches. O
