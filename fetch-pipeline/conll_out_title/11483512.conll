# Abstract
Many O
eukaryotic O
cell O
surface O
proteins O
are O
anchored O
to O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
via O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
(GPI). B-Chemical
The O
GPI B-Chemical
transamidase O
mediates O
GPI B-Chemical
anchoring O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum, O
by O
replacing O
a O
protein's O
C-terminal O
GPI B-Chemical
attachment O
signal O
peptide O
with O
a O
pre-assembled O
GPI. B-Chemical
During O
this O
transamidation O
reaction, O
the O
GPI B-Chemical
transamidase O
forms O
a O
carbonyl O
intermediate O
with O
a O
substrate O
protein. O
It O
was O
known O
that O
the O
GPI B-Chemical
transamidase O
is O
a O
complex O
containing O
GAA1 B-Gene
and O
GPI8. O
Here, O
we O
report O
two O
new O
components O
of O
this O
enzyme: O
PIG-S B-Gene
and O
PIG-T. B-Gene
To O
determine O
roles O
for O
PIG-S B-Gene
and O
PIG-T, B-Gene
we O
disrupted O
these O
genes O
in O
mouse B-Species
F9 B-CellLine
cells O
by O
homologous O
recombination. O
PIG-S B-Gene
and O
PIG-T B-Gene
knockout O

were O
defective O
in O
transfer O
of O
GPI B-Chemical
to O
proteins, O
particularly O
in O
formation O
of O
the O
carbonyl O
intermediates. O
We O
also O
demonstrate O
that O
PIG-S B-Gene
and O
PIG-T B-Gene
form O
a O
protein O
complex O
with O
GAA1 B-Gene
and O
GPI8, O
and O
that O
PIG-T B-Gene
maintains O
the O
complex O
by O
stabilizing O
the O
expression O
of O
GAA1 B-Gene
and O
GPI8. O
Saccharomyces B-Species

Gpi16p B-Gene
(YHR188C) O
and O
Gpi17p B-Gene
(YDR434W) O
are O
orthologues O
of O
PIG-T B-Gene
and O
PIG-S, B-Gene
respectively. O
