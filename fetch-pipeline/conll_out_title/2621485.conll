# Abstract
Cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
was O
metabolized O
by O
rat B-Species
enterocytes O
to O
pyruvate B-Chemical
and O
inorganic B-Chemical
sulfur B-Chemical
but O
not O
to O
taurine. B-Chemical
Cystine B-Chemical
was O
the O
major O
extracellular O
form O
of O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
present O
during O
the O
incubation, O
and O
addition O
of O
bathocuproine B-Chemical
disulfonate, I-Chemical
a O
copper B-Chemical
chelator O
that O
maintained O
60% O
of O
the O
total O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
in O
the O
sulfhydryl B-Chemical
form, O
had O
no O
effect O
on O
total O
sulfur B-Chemical
release O
from O
cyst(e)ine. B-Chemical
Oxidation O
of O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
to O
35SO4(2-) B-Chemical
or O
14CO2 B-Chemical
was O
reduced O
by O
about O
50% O
when O
unlabeled O
cysteinesulfinate B-Chemical
was O
added O
to O
incubations O
of O
enterocytes O
with O
labeled O
cyst(e)ine. B-Chemical
Thus, O
about O
one O
half O
of O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
metabolism O
appeared O
to O
involve O
its O
oxidation O
to O
cysteinesulfinate B-Chemical
and O
the O
transamination O
of O
cysteinesulfinate B-Chemical
to O
the O
putative O
intermediate O
sulfinylpyruvate, B-Chemical
which O
decomposes O
to O
yield O
sulfite B-Chemical
and O
pyruvate. B-Chemical
The O
remainder O
of O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
catabolism O
in O
enterocytes O
appeared O
to O
involve O
release O
of O
sulfur B-Chemical
from O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
prior O
to O
its O
oxidation. O
Inhibition O
of O
gamma-cystathionase B-Gene
by O
propargylglycine, B-Chemical
although O
incomplete, O
resulted O
in O
substantial O
inhibition O
of O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
catabolism. O
The O
accumulation O
of O
cysteinethiosulfonate, B-Chemical
which O
forms O
nonenzymatically O
upon O
incubation O
of O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
with O
thiosulfate, B-Chemical
and O
the O
inhibition O
of O
cysteinethiosulfonate B-Chemical
formation O
by O
propargylglycine B-Chemical
demonstrated O
the O
catabolism O
of O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
by O
beta-cleavage O
catalyzed O
by O
gamma-cystathionase. B-Gene
Sulfide B-Chemical
released O
from O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
in O
this O
reaction O
appeared O
to O
be O
oxidized O
to O
thiosulfate B-Chemical
before O
it O
was O
further O
oxidized O
to O
sulfite B-Chemical
and O
sulfate. B-Chemical
In O
addition O
to O
being O
oxidized O
to O
sulfate, B-Chemical
some O
of O
the O
sulfite B-Chemical
formed O
by O
enterocytes O
reacted O
with O
cyst(e)ine B-Chemical
in O
the O
incubation O
medium O
to O
form O
sulfocysteine. B-Chemical

corresponded O
with O
the O

pathways. O
