# Abstract
The O
import O
of O
metals, O
iron B-Chemical
in O
particular, O
into O
mitochondria O
is O
poorly O
understood. O
Iron B-Chemical
in O
mitochondria O
is O
required O
for O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
heme B-Chemical
and O
various O
iron-sulfur O
proteins. O
We O
have O
developed O
an O
in O
vitro O
assay O
to O
follow O
the O
uptake O
of O
iron B-Chemical
into O
isolated O
yeast B-Species
mitochondria. O
By O
measuring O
the O
incorporation O
of O
iron B-Chemical
into O
porphyrin B-Chemical
by O
ferrochelatase O
in O
the O
matrix, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
define O
the O
mechanism O
of O
iron B-Chemical
import. O
Iron B-Chemical
uptake O
is O
driven O
energetically O
by O
a O
membrane O
potential O
across O
the O
inner O
membrane O
but O
does O
not O
require O
ATP. B-Chemical
Only O
reduced O
iron B-Chemical
is O
functional O
in O
generating O
heme. B-Chemical
Iron B-Chemical
cannot O
be O
preloaded O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix O
but O
rather O
has O
to O
be O
transported O
across O
the O
inner O
membrane O
simultaneously O
with O
the O
synthesis O
of O
heme, B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
ferrochelatase O
receives O
iron B-Chemical
directly O
from O
the O
inner O
membrane. O
Transport O
of O
iron B-Chemical
is O
inhibited O
by O
manganese B-Chemical
but O
not O
by O
zinc, O
nickel, B-Chemical
and O
copper B-Chemical
ions, O
explaining O
why O
in O
vivo O
these O
ions O
are O
not O
incorporated O
into O
porphyrin. B-Chemical
The O
inner O
membrane O
proteins O
Mmt1p B-Gene
and O
Mmt2p B-Gene
proposed O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
mitochondrial O
iron B-Chemical
movement O
are O
not O
required O
for O
the O
supply O
of O
ferrochelatase O
with O
iron. B-Chemical
Iron B-Chemical
transport O
can O
be O
reconstituted O
efficiently O
in O
a O
membrane O
potential-dependent O
fashion O
in O
proteoliposomes O
that O
were O
formed O
from O
a O
detergent O
extract O
of O
mitochondria. O
Our O
biochemical O
analysis O
of O
iron B-Chemical
import O
into O
yeast B-Species
mitochondria O
provides O
the O
basis O
for O
the O
identification O
of O
components O
involved O
in O
transport. O
