# Abstract
Cotransporters O
represent O
a O
major O
class O
of O
proteins O
that O
make O
use O
of O
ion O
gradients O
to O
drive O
active O
transport O
of O
substrate O
into O
cells. O
A O
new O
human B-Species
gene, O
KST1, B-Gene
encoding O
a O
member O
of O
the O
sodium O
glucose O
cotransporter O
family, O
was O
identified O
onto O
human B-Species
chromosome O
16p12-p11. O
This O
genomic O
region O
contains O
a O
major O
gene O
responsible O
for O
a O
syndrome O
of B-Disease
infantile I-Disease
convulsions I-Disease
and I-Disease
paroxysmal I-Disease
dyskinesia I-Disease
(ICCA B-Disease
syndrome), I-Disease
inherited O
as O
an O
autosomal O
dominant O
trait, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
benign B-Disease
familial I-Disease
infantile I-Disease
convulsions I-Disease
(BFIC). B-Disease
The O
entire O
coding O
sequence O
of O
the O
human B-Species
KST1 B-Gene
gene O
was O
determined O
using O
a O
combination O
of O
methods O
including O
in O
silico O
comparison O
of O
its O
rabbit O
orthologous O
DNA O
complementary O
to O
RNA O
(cDNA) O
to O
the O
corresponding O
human B-Species
genomic O
sequences, O
reverse O
transcription-polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
on O
human B-Species
brain O
RNA, O
5' O
and O
3' O
rapid O
amplification O
of O
cDNA O
ends. O
The O
gene O
is O
divided O
into O
16 O
exons O
and O
the O
predicted O
protein O
of O
675 O
amino O
acids O
contains O
14 O
transmembrane O
domains. O
It O
shares O
significant O
homology O
to O
the O
sodium-glucose O
transporter O
1 O
cotransporter O
proteins. O
An O
alternatively O
spliced O
transcript O
resulting O
from O
the O
skipping O
of O
exon O
6 O
led O
to O
a O
predicted O
protein O
lacking O
the O
4th O
transmembrane O
domain. O
As O
ion O
transporters O
are O
good O
candidates O
for O
a O
large O
variety O
of O
human B-Species
diseases, O
including O
paroxysmal B-Disease
disorders, I-Disease
a O
mutation O
search O
was O
performed O
in O
four O
families O
with O
ICCA B-Disease
or O
BFIC B-Disease
syndromes. I-Disease
No O
pathogenic O
mutation O
was O
found, O
although O
several O
polymorphic O
variants O
with O
amino O
acids O
exchanges O
were O
identified. O
Due O
to O
its O
broad O
expression O
in O
human B-Species
tissues, O
the O
human B-Species
KST1 B-Gene
gene O
could O
be O
involved O
in O
several O
other O
diseases O
mapped O
to O
human B-Species
chromosome O
16p12-p11. O
