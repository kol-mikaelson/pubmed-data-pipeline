# Abstract
We O
describe O
here O
the O
identification O
and O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
member O
of O
the O
family O
of O
K(+)-dependent O
Na(+) O
Ca(2+) O
exchangers, O
NCKX3 B-Gene
(gene O
SLC24A3). B-Gene
Human B-Species
NCKX3 B-Gene
encodes O
a O
protein O
of O
644 O
amino O
acids O
that O
displayed O
a O
high O
level O
of O
sequence O
identity O
to O
the O
other O
family O
members, O
rod O
NCKX1 B-Gene
and O
cone O
neuronal O
NCKX2, B-Gene
in O
the O
hydrophobic O
regions O
surrounding O
the O
"alpha O
-repeat" O
sequences O
thought O
to O
form O
the O
ion-binding O
pocket O
for O
transport. O
Outside O
of O
these O
regions O
NCKX3 B-Gene
showed O
no O
significant O
identity O
to O
other O
known O
proteins. O
As O
anticipated O
from O
this O
sequence O
similarity, O
NCKX3 B-Gene
displayed O
K(+)-dependent O
Na(+) B-Gene
Ca(2+) I-Gene
exchanger I-Gene
activity O
when O
assayed O
in O
heterologous O
expression O
systems, O
using O
digital O
imaging O
of O
fura-2 B-Chemical
fluorescence, O
electrophysiology, O
or O
radioactive O
(45)Ca(2+) B-Chemical
uptake. O
The O
N-terminal O
region O
of O
NCKX3, B-Gene
although O
not O
essential O
for O
expression, O
increased O
functional O
activity O
at O
least O
10-fold O
and O
may O
represent O
a O
cleavable O
signal O
sequence. O
NCKX3 B-Gene
transcripts O
were O
most O
abundant O
in O
brain, O
with O
highest O
levels O
found O
in O
selected O
thalamic O
nuclei, O
in O
hippocampal O
CA1 O
neurons, O
and O
in O
layer O
IV O
of O
the O
cerebral O
cortex. O
Many O
other O
tissues O
also O
expressed O
NCKX3 B-Gene
at O
lower O
levels, O
especially O
aorta, O
uterus, O
and O
intestine, O
which O
are O
rich O
in O
smooth O
muscle. O
The O
discovery O
of O
NCKX3 B-Gene
thus O
expands O
the O
K(+)-dependent O
Na(+) B-Gene
Ca(2+) I-Gene
exchanger I-Gene
family O
and O
suggests O
this O
class O
of O
transporter O
has O
a O
more O
widespread O
role O
in O
cellular O
Ca(2+) O
handling O
than O
previously O
appreciated. O
