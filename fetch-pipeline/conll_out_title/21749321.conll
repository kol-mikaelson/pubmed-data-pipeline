# Abstract
Our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
and O
regulation O
of O
intestinal O
absorption O
of O
water-soluble B-Chemical
vitamins I-Chemical
under O
normal O
physiological O
conditions, O
and O
of O
the O
factors O
conditions O
that O
affect O
and O
interfere O
with O
theses O
processes O
has O
been O
significantly O
expanded O
in O
recent O
years O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
availability O
of O
a O
host O
of O
valuable O
molecular O
cellular O
tools. O
Although O
structurally O
and O
functionally O
unrelated, O
the O
water-soluble B-Chemical
vitamins I-Chemical
share O
the O
feature O
of O
being O
essential O
for O
normal O
cellular O
functions, O
growth O
and O
development, O
and O
that O
their O
deficiency O
leads O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
clinical B-Disease
abnormalities I-Disease
that O
range O
from O
anaemia B-Disease
to O
growth B-Disease
retardation I-Disease
and O
neurological B-Disease
disorders. I-Disease
Humans B-Species
cannot O
synthesize O
water-soluble B-Chemical
vitamins I-Chemical
(with O
the O
exception O
of O
some O
endogenous O
synthesis O
of O
niacin) B-Chemical
and O
must O
obtain O
these O
micronutrients O
from O
exogenous O
sources. O
Thus O
body O
homoeostasis O
of O
these O
micronutrients O
depends O
on O
their O
normal O
absorption O
in O
the O
intestine. O
Interference O
with O
absorption, O
which O
occurs O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
conditions O
(e.g. O
congenital B-Disease
defects I-Disease
in I-Disease
the O
digestive O
or O
absorptive O
system, O
intestinal B-Disease
disease I-Disease
resection, O
drug O
interaction O
and O
chronic O
alcohol B-Chemical
use), O
leads O
to O
the O
development O
of O
deficiency O
(and O
sub-optimal O
status) O
and O
results O
in O
clinical B-Disease
abnormalities. I-Disease
It O
is O
well O
established O
now O
that O
intestinal O
absorption O
of O
the O
water-soluble B-Chemical
vitamins I-Chemical
ascorbate, B-Chemical
biotin, B-Chemical
folate, B-Chemical
niacin, B-Chemical
pantothenic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
pyridoxine, B-Chemical
riboflavin B-Chemical
and O
thiamin B-Chemical
is O
via O
specific O
carrier-mediated O
processes. O
These O
processes O
are O
regulated O
by O
a O
variety O
of O
factors O
and O
conditions, O
and O
the O
regulation O
involves O
transcriptional O
and O
or O
post-transcriptional O
mechanisms. O
Also O
well O
recognized O
now O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
large O
intestine O
possesses O
specific O
and O
efficient O
uptake O
systems O
to O
absorb O
a O
number O
of O
water-soluble B-Chemical
vitamins I-Chemical
that O
are O
synthesized O
by O
the O
normal O
microflora. O
This O
source O
may O
contribute O
to O
total O
body O
vitamin O
nutrition, O
and O
especially O
towards O
the O
cellular O
nutrition O
and O
health O
of O
the O
local O
colonocytes. O
The O
present O
review O
aims O
to O
outline O
our O
current O
understanding O
of O
the O
mechanisms O
involved O
in O
intestinal O
absorption O
of O
water-soluble B-Chemical
vitamins, I-Chemical
their O
regulation, O
the O
cell O
biology O
of O
the O
carriers O
involved O
and O
the O
factors O
that O
negatively O
affect O
these O
absorptive O
events. O
