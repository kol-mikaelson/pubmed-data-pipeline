# Abstract
The O

the O

dopaminergic O

neuromelanin B-Chemical
in O
the O
substantia O

and O
responsible O
for O
motor O
symptoms O
of O
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease I-Disease
are O
still O
unknown. O
The O
discovery O
of O
genes O
associated O
with O
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease I-Disease
(such O
as O
alpha B-Gene
synuclein I-Gene
(SNCA), B-Gene
E3 O

(parkin), B-Gene
DJ-1 B-Gene

contributed O
enormously O
to O
basic O
research O
towards O
understanding O
the O
role O
of O
these O
proteins O
in O
the O

However, O
it O
is O
generally O
accepted O
by O
the O
scientific O
community O
that O
mitochondria B-Disease

oxidative O

are O
involved O
in O
neurodegeneration. B-Disease
Dopamine B-Chemical
oxidation O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
complex O
pathway O
in O
which O
dopamine B-Chemical
o-quinone, I-Chemical
aminochrome B-Chemical
and O
5,6-indolequinone B-Chemical
are O
formed. O
However, O
both O
dopamine B-Chemical
o-quinone I-Chemical
and O
5,6-indolequinone B-Chemical
are O
so O
unstable O
that O
is O
difficult O
to O
study O
and O
separate O
their O
roles O
in O
the O

Dopamine B-Chemical
oxidation O

dopamine B-Chemical
o-quinone, I-Chemical

and O
5,6-indolequinone B-Chemical
seems O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
neurodegenerative O
processes O
of O
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease I-Disease
as O
aminochrome B-Chemical
induces: O
(i) O
mitochondria B-Disease
dysfunction, I-Disease
(ii) O

(iii) O

The O
neurotoxic B-Disease
effects O
of O
aminochrome B-Chemical
in O
dopaminergic O
neurons O
can O
be O
inhibited O
by: O
(i) O
preventing O
dopamine B-Chemical
oxidation O
of O
the O
transporter O
that O
takes O
up O
dopamine B-Chemical
into O
monoaminergic O
vesicles O
with O
low O

and O
dopamine B-Chemical

catalyzed O

(ii) O
dopamine B-Chemical

(iii) O
two-electron O
reduction O
of O

catalyzed O
by O
DT-diaphorase. B-Gene
Furthermore, O
dopamine B-Chemical
conversion O
to O
NM B-Chemical
seems O
to O
have O
a O
dual O
role, O
protective O
and O
toxic, O
depending O
mostly O
on O
the O
cellular O
context. O
Dopamine B-Chemical
oxidation O
to O
dopamine B-Chemical
o-quinone, I-Chemical
aminochrome B-Chemical
and O
5,6-indolequinone B-Chemical
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
neurodegeneration B-Disease
in O
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease I-Disease
since O
they O
induce O
mitochondria O

However, O
