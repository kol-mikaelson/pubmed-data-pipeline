# Title
Carnitine B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
in O
mammals. O

# Abstract
Carnitine B-Chemical
is O
indispensable O
for O
energy O
metabolism, O
since O
it O
enables O
activated O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
to O
enter O
the O
mitochondria, O
where O
they O
are O
broken O
down O
via O
beta-oxidation. O
Carnitine B-Chemical
is O
probably O
present O
in O
all O
animal O
species, O
and O
in O
numerous O
micro-organisms O
and O
plants. O
In O
mammals, O
carnitine B-Chemical
homoeostasis O
is O
maintained O
by O
endogenous O
synthesis, O
absorption O
from O
dietary O
sources O
and O
efficient O
tubular O
reabsorption O
by O
the O
kidney. O
This O
review O
aims O
to O
cover O
the O
current O
knowledge O
of O
the O
enzymological, O
molecular, O
metabolic O
and O
regulatory O
aspects O
of O
mammalian O
carnitine B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
with O
an O
emphasis O
on O
the O
human O
and O
rat. O
