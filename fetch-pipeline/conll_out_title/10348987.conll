viral B-Disease
hepatitis I-Disease

(A, O

were O
investigated O
and O
compared O
with O
the O
control O
group O
of O

individuals. O
Hepatitis B-Disease
cases O
were O
classified O
with O
respect O
to O
their O
serological O
findings O
and O
clinics. O
When O
compared O
all O
the O
hepatitis B-Disease
cases O
with O
the O
controls, O
levels O
of O
aspartate O

alanine B-Gene
aminotransferase, I-Gene

as O
ADA B-Gene

were O
significantly O
higher O
than O
the O
control O
group O
(p<0.01). O
Levels O
of O
ADA B-Gene

respectively. O
When O
compared O
their O

there O
was O
no O
