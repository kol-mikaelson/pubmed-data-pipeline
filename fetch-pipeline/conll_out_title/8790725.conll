# Abstract
Hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia I-Disease
type I-Disease
I I-Disease
(HT B-Disease
I, I-Disease
McKusick O
276,700) O
is O
a O
metabolic B-Disease
disease I-Disease
with O
a O
pattern O
of O
autosomal O
recessive O
inheritance. O
The O
disease O
is O
caused O
by O
a O
deficiency O
of O
the O
enzyme O
involved O
in O
the O
last O
step O
in O
the O
degradation O
of O
the O
amino O
acid O
tyrosine, B-Chemical
fumarylacetoacetate B-Chemical
hydrolase I-Gene
(FAH). B-Gene
The O
result O
of O
this O
block O
is O
the O
accumulation O
of O
catabolites O
some O
of O
which O
have O
been O
proposed O
to O
be O
highly O
toxic O
due O
to O
their O
alkylating O
potential. O
In O
humans, B-Species
hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia I-Disease
is O
often O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
hepatocellular B-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
in O
young O
patients. B-Species
The O
reasons O
for O
the O
high O
incidence O
of O
hepatocellular B-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
are O
unknown O
but O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
it O
may O
be O
caused O
by O
accumulated O
metabolites O
such O
as O
fumarylacetoacetate B-Chemical
(FAA) B-Chemical
and O
maleylacetoacetate B-Chemical
(MAA). B-Chemical
The O
various O
mutational O
defects O
in O
the O
FAH B-Gene
gene O
are O
reviewed. O
The O
use O
of O
two O
mouse B-Species
models O
of O
this O
disease O
to O
study O
the O
molecular O
basis O
of O
the O
pathologies O
associated O
with O
HT B-Disease
I I-Disease
are O
discussed. O
Finally, O
some O
preliminary O
data O
on O
the O
mutagenic O
potential O
of O
FAA B-Chemical
and O
MAA B-Chemical
in O
a O
gene O
reversal O
assay O
are O
presented. O
