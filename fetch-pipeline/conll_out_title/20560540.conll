# Abstract
In O
eukaryotes, O
choline B-Chemical
acetyltransferase I-Gene
(ChAT) B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
reversible O
formation O
of O
the O
neurotransmitter O
acetylcholine B-Chemical
from O
choline B-Chemical
and O
acetyl-CoA. B-Chemical
ChAT B-Gene
belongs O
to O
a O
family O
of O
CoA-dependent O
enzymes O
that O
also O
includes O
the O
carnitine B-Chemical
acyltransferases O
CrAT, B-Gene
CrOT, B-Gene
and O
CPTs. O
In O
contrast O
to O
CrOT B-Gene
and O
CPTs O
that O
are O
very O
active O
toward O
medium- O
and O
long-chain O
acyl-CoAs, B-Chemical
respectively, O
CrAT B-Gene
and O
ChAT B-Gene
display O
activity O
toward O
only O
short-chain O
acyl-CoAs. B-Chemical
We O
recently O
demonstrated O
the O
substrate O
and O
cosubstrate O
promiscuity O
of O
the O
wild-type O
human B-Species
ChAT B-Gene
(hChAT). O
To O
extend O
the O
flexibility O
of O
this O
enzyme, O
we O
have O
generated O
a O
series O
of O
single, O
double, O
and O
triple O
hChAT O
mutants. O
Here O
we O
report O
the O
conversion O
of O
hChAT O
into O
choline B-Chemical
octanoyltransferase O
(ChOT) O
and O
choline B-Chemical
palmitoyltransferase O
(ChPT). O
The O
E337 O
and O
C550 O
residues O
(numbering O
from O
hChAT) O
were O
previously O
shown O
to O
dictate O
the O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
cosubstrate O
specificity O
in O
the O
carnitine B-Chemical
series. O
Here O
we O
identify O
and O
demonstrate O
the O
importance O
of O
C551, O
in O
addition O
to O
E337 O
and O
C550, O
in O
contributing O
to O
the O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
specificity O
of O
hChAT. O
We O
also O
show O
that O
either O
C550 O
or O
C551 O
needs O
to O
be O
present O
for O
the O
transfer O
of O
medium- O
and O
long-chain O
acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
by O
hChAT. O
By O
exploring O
the O
potential O
expansion O
of O
the O
tunnel O
on O
the O
substrate O
side, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
residues O
M84, O
Y436, O
and O
Y552 O
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
binding O
and O
holding O
the O
choline B-Chemical
substrate O
in O
the O
ChAT B-Gene
active O
site. O
