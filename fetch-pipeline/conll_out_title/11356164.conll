# Abstract
Peroxisomes O
are O
subcellular O
organelles O
with O
an O
indispensable O
role O
in O
cellular O
metabolism. O
The O
importance O
of O
peroxisomes O
for O
humans B-Species
is O
stressed O
by O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
group O
of O
genetic B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
in O
humans B-Species
in O
which O
there O
is O
an O
impairment O
in O
one O
or O
more O
peroxisomal O
functions. O
Most O
of O
these O
functions O
have O
to O
do O
with O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism O
including O
the O
alpha- O
and O
beta-oxidation O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
Here O
we O
describe O
the O
current O
state O
of O
knowledge O
about O
peroxisomal O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
alpha- O
and O
beta-oxidation O
with O
particular O
emphasis O
on O
the O
following: O
(1) O
the O
substrates O
beta-oxidized O
in O
peroxisomes; O
(2) O
the O
enzymology O
of O
the O
alpha- O
and O
beta-oxidation O
systems; O
(3) O
the O
permeability O
properties O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
membrane O
and O
the O
role O
of O
the O
different O
transporters O
therein; O
(4) O
the O
interaction O
with O
other O
subcellular O
compartments, O
including O
the O
mitochondria, O
which O
are O
the O
ultimate O
site O
of O
NADH B-Chemical
re-oxidation O
and O
full O
degradation O
of O
acetyl-CoA B-Chemical
to O
CO(2) B-Chemical
and O
water; O
and O
(5) O
the O
different O
disorders O
of O
peroxisomal O
alpha- O
and O
beta-oxidation. O
