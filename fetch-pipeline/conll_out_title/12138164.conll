# Abstract
Heparan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
3-O-sulfotransferase O
transfers O

The O

revealed O
that O
3-OST-5 B-Gene

Furthermore, O
we O
found O
that O
3-OST-5-modified O

also O
bound O

antithrombin, B-Gene
suggesting O
that O
3-OST-5 B-Gene
also O

In O
summary, O
our O
results O
indicate O
that O
a O

3-OST O
family O
generates O
both O

and O
an O
