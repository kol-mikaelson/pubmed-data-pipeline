# Abstract
In O
the O
skin O
epidermis, O
the O
metabolism O
of O
polyunsaturated B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(PUFAs) B-Chemical
is O
highly O
active. O
Dietary O

of O
linoleic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(LA), O
the O
major O
18-carbon B-Chemical
n-6 I-Chemical
PUFA I-Chemical
in O
normal O
epidermis, O
results O
in O
a O
characteristic O
scaly B-Disease
skin I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
and O
excessive O
epidermal O
water B-Disease
loss. I-Disease
Because O
of O
the O
inability O
of O
normal O
skin O
epidermis O
to O
desaturate O
LA O
to O
gamma-linolenic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
it O
is O
transformed O
by O
epidermal O
15-lipoxygenase B-Gene
to O
mainly O
13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
which O
functionally O
exerts O
antiproliferative O
properties O
in O
the O
tissue. O
In O
contrast, O
compared O
with O
LA, O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(AA) O
is O
a O
relatively O
minor O
20-carbon B-Chemical
n-6 I-Chemical
PUFA I-Chemical
in O
the O
skin O
and O
is O
metabolized O
via O
the O
cyclooxygenase O
pathway, O
predominantly O
to O
the O
prostaglandins B-Chemical
E(2), I-Chemical
F(2)(alpha), B-Chemical
and O
D(2). B-Chemical
AA O
is O
also O
metabolized O
via O
the O
15-lipoxygenase B-Gene
pathway, O
predominantly O
to O
15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
At O
low O
concentrations, O
the O
prostaglandins B-Chemical
function O
to O
modulate O
normal O
skin O
physiologic O
processes, O
whereas O
at O
high O
concentrations O
they O
induce O
inflammatory B-Disease
processes. O
PUFAs B-Chemical
derived O
from O
other O
dietary B-Chemical
oils I-Chemical
are O
also O
transformed O
mainly O
into O
monohydroxy B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
For O
instance, O
epidermal O
15-lipoxygenase B-Gene
transforms O
dihomo-gamma-linolenic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(20:3n-6) B-Chemical
to O
15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
eicosapentaenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(20:5n-3) B-Chemical
to O
15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
docosahexaenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(22:6n-3) B-Chemical
to O
17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
respectively. O
These O
monohydroxy B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
exhibit O
antiinflammatory O
properties O
in O
vitro. O
Thus, O
supplementation O
of O
diets O
with O
appropriate O
purified O
vegetable B-Chemical
oils, I-Chemical
fish B-Species
oil, I-Species
or O
both O
may O
generate O
local O
cutaneous O
antiinflammatory O
and O
antiproliferative O
metabolites O
which O
could O
serve O
as O
less O
toxic O
in O
vivo O
monotherapies O
or O
as O
adjuncts O
to O
standard O
therapeutic O
regimens O
for O
the O
management O
of O
inflammatory B-Disease
