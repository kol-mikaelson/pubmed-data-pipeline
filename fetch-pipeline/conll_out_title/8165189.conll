# Abstract
The O
in O
vitro O
Ussing O
technique O
was O
employed O
to O
examine O
transport O
rates O
for O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
and O
arginine B-Chemical
across O
rabbit B-Species
intestinal O
tissues. O
Mannitol B-Chemical
and O
transepithelial O
conductance O
were O
used O
to O
monitor O
the O
integrity O
of O
rabbit B-Species
intestinal O
tissues O
and O
the O
basal O
and O
stimulated O
short-circuit O
current O
were O
measured O
to O
assess O
functional O
viability. O
Transepithelial O
transport O
of O
acetaminophen, B-Chemical
arginine, B-Chemical
and O
mannitol B-Chemical
was O
determined O
in O
rabbit B-Species
jejunum, O
ileum, O
and O
distal O
colon. O
Transepithelial O
transport O
of O
arginine B-Chemical
in O
the O
ileum O
and O
jejunum O
was O
composed O
of O
both O
passive O
(nonsaturable) O
(Pm O

0.06) O
and O
saturable O
components O
(KT O

0.6-0.7 O
mM; O
Jmax O

0.3-0.4 O
mumol O

The O
saturable O
component O
of O
arginine B-Chemical
fluxes O
was O
abolished O
by O
pretreatment O
of O
the O
tissue O
with O
serosal O
ouabain B-Chemical
(0.1 O
mM). O
In O
the O
distal O
colon, O
both O
unidirectional O
arginine B-Chemical
fluxes O
were O
nonsaturable. O
In O
the O
segments O
examined, O
both O
unidirectional O
fluxes O
of O
acetaminophen B-Chemical
were O
nonsaturable O
over O
the O
concentration O
range O
from O
0.1 O
to O
30 O
mM. O
These O
results O
provide O

both O
the O
cellular O
and O
the O
paracellular O
