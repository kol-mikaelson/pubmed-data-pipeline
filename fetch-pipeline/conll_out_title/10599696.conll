# Abstract
Classical B-Disease
3beta-hydroxysteroid I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
delta5-delta4 I-Disease
isomerase I-Disease
(3betaHSD) B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
a O
form O
of O
congenital B-Disease
adrenal I-Disease
hyperplasia I-Disease
that O
impairs O
steroidogenesis O
in O
both O
the O
adrenals O
and O
gonads O
resulting O
from O
mutations O
in O
the O
HSD3B2 B-Gene
gene O
and O
causing O
various O
degrees O
of O
salt-wasting B-Disease
in O
both O

and O

11 O

complete O
nucleotide O
sequence O

the O
whole O

of O
this O
gene O
was O
determined O
by O

Five O
of O
these O
families O
were O
referred O
to O
Morel's O
molecular O
diagnostics O
laboratory O
in O
France, O
whereas O
the O
two O
other O
families O
were O
investigated O
by O
Peter's O
group O
in O
Germany. O
Functional O
characterization O
studies O
were O
performed O
by O
Simard's O
group O
in O
Canada. O
Following O
transient O
expression O
in O
293 B-CellLine
cells O
of O
each O
of O
the O
mutant O
recombinant O
proteins O
generated O
by O
site-directed O
mutagenesis, O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
25 O
mutations O
on O
enzyme O
activity O
was O
assessed O
by O
incubating O
intact O
cells O
in O
culture O
with O
10 O
nM O
[14C]-DHEA B-Chemical
as O
substrate. O
The O
stability O
of O
the O
mutant O

has O
been O
investigated O
using O
a O
combination O
of O
Northern O
and O
Western O
blot O
analyses, O
as O
well O
as O
an O

transcription O
translation O
assay O
using O
rabbit B-Species
reticulocyte O
lysates. O
The O
present O
report O
describes O
the O
identification O
of O
8 O
mutations, O
in O
seven O
new O
families O
with O
individuals O
suffering O
from O
classical O
3betaHSD B-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
thus O
increasing O
the O
number O
of O
known O
HSD3B2 B-Gene
mutations O
involved O
in O
this O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease
disorder I-Disease
to O
31 O
(1 O
splicing, O
1 O
in-frame O
deletion, O
3 O
nonsense, O
4 O
frameshift O
and O
22 O
missense O
mutations). O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
mutations O
reported O
here O
in O
these O
new O
families, O
we O
have O
also O
investigated O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
functional O
significance O
of O
previously O
reported O
missense O
mutations O
and O
or O
sequence O
variants O
namely, O
A82T, B-ProteinMutation
A167V, B-ProteinMutation
L173R, B-ProteinMutation
L205P, B-ProteinMutation
S213G B-ProteinMutation
and O
K216E, B-ProteinMutation
P222H, B-ProteinMutation
T259M, B-ProteinMutation
and O
T259R, B-ProteinMutation
which O
have O
not O
previously O
been O
functionally O
characterized. O
Furthermore, O
their O
effects O
have O
been O
compared O
with O
those O
of O
the O
10 O
previously O
reported O
mutant O
enzymes O
to O
provide O
a O
more O
consistent O
and O
comprehensive O
study. O
The O
present O
results O
are O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
prediction O
that O
no O
functional O
3betaHSD O
type O
2 O
isoenzyme O
is O
expressed O
in O
the O
adrenals O
and O
gonads O
of O
the O
patients B-Species
suffering O
from O
a O
severe O
salt-wasting B-Disease
form O
of O
CAH B-Disease
due O
to O
classical O
3betaHSD B-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
Whereas O
the O
nonsalt-losing O
form O
also O
results O
from O
missense O
mutation(s) O
in O
the O
HSD3B2 B-Gene
gene, O
which O
cause O
an O
incomplete O
loss O
in O
enzyme O
activity, O
thus O
leaving O
sufficient O
enzymatic O
activity O
to O
prevent O
salt B-Disease
wasting. I-Disease
The O
functional O
data O
described O
in O
the O
present O
study O
concerning O
the O
sequence O
variants O
A167V, B-ProteinMutation
S213G, B-ProteinMutation
K216E B-ProteinMutation
and O
L236S, B-ProteinMutation
which O
were O
detected O
with O
premature B-Disease
pubarche I-Disease
or O
hyperandrogenic O
adolescent O

suspected O
to O
be O
affected O
from O
nonclassical B-Disease
3betaHSD B-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
coupled O
with O
the O
previous O
studies O
reporting O
that O
no O
mutations O
were O
found O
in O
both O
HSD3B1 B-Gene
and O
or O
HSD3B2 B-Gene
genes O
in O
such O
patients B-Species
strongly O
support O
the O
conclusion O
that O
this O
disorder O
does O
not O
result O
from O
a O
mutant O
3betaHSD O
isoenzyme. O
The O
present O
study O
provides O
biochemical O
evidence O
supporting O
the O
involvement O
of O
a O
new O
molecular O
mechanism O
in O
classical O
3betaHSD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
involving O

the O

the O
