# Abstract
Fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation O
occurs O
in O
both O
mitochondria O
and O
peroxisomes. O
Mitochondria O
catalyze O
the O
beta-oxidation O
of O
the O
bulk O
of O
short-, O
medium-, O
and O
long-chain B-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
derived O
from O
diet, O
and O
this O
pathway O
constitutes O
the O
major O
process O
by O
which O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
oxidized O
to O

energy. O
Peroxisomes O
are O

Long-chain B-Chemical

toxic O
dicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(DCAs) B-Chemical
that O
serve O
as O
substrates O
for O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation, O
and O
this O
process O
also O
leads O
to O
the O
