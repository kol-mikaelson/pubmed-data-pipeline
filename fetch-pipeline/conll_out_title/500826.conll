# Abstract
The O
mechanisms O
underlying O
ethylmalonic-adipic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
were O
studied O
in O
a O
5-yr-old O
girl. O
Oxidation O
of O
radioactive O
substrates O
by O
cultured O
skin O
fibroblasts O
from O
the O
proband O
and O
asymptomatic O
family O
members O
was O
also O
determined O
and O
compared O
to O
that O
by O
normal O
fibroblasts O
and O
that O
by O
cells O
from O
a O
patient B-Species
with O
glutaric B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
type I-Disease
II. I-Disease
Feeding O
medium-chain B-Chemical
triglycerides I-Chemical
promptly O
induced O
vomiting B-Disease
and O
lethargy B-Disease
accompanied O
by O
a O
pronounced O
increase O
of O
urinary O
ethylmalonate. B-Chemical
Significant O
increases O
of O
serum O
isovalerate B-Chemical
and O
urinary O
isovalerylglycine B-Chemical
were O
observed O
after O
leucine B-Chemical
feeding, O
but O
urinary O
glutarate B-Chemical
increased O
only O
slightly O
after O
lysine B-Chemical
feeding. O
Thus, O
the O
results O
from O
clinical O
investigation O
remained O
equivocal O
as O
to O
whether O
pathways O
other O
than O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
were O
blocked O
in O
our O
patient. B-Species
Oxidation O
of O
[1-(14)C]butyrate B-Chemical
by O
cultured O
skin O
fibroblasts O
from O
the O
proband O
was O
reduced O
to O
14% O
of O
control. O
In O
vitro O
oxidation O
of O
[2-(14)C]lysine B-Chemical
and O
[2-(14)C]leucine B-Chemical
was O
also O
reduced O
to O
28 O
and O
23% O
of O
control, O
respectively. O
Much O
more O
severe O
reduction O
in O
oxidation O
of O
these O
three O
substrates O
(3, O
9, O
and O
9%, O
respectively) O
was O
observed O
in O
glutaric B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
type I-Disease
II I-Disease
cells. O
These O
results O
indicated O
that O
in O
the O
proband, O
degradative O
pathways O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
lysine, B-Chemical
and O
leucine B-Chemical
are O
blocked O
at O
the O
steps O
of O
butyryl-CoA, B-Chemical
glutaryl-CoA, O
and O
isovaleryl-CoA O
dehydrogenases, O
respectively, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
glutaric B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
type I-Disease
II. I-Disease
Because O
activities O
of O
multiple O
acyl-CoA O
dehydrogenases O
are O
reduced, O
a O
deficiency O
of O
electron-transferring B-Disease
flavoprotein, I-Disease
which O
serves O
as O
a O
hydrogen-acceptor O
for O
these O
dehydrogenases, O
is O
postulated O
as O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms O
of O
these O
two O
diseases, O
but O
a O
genetic O
heterogeneity O
was O
indicated O
by O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
residual O
activities O
in O
these O
two O
types O
of O
cells. O
The O
hypothesis O
of O
more O
than O
one O
mutant O
allele O
of O
an O
autosomal O
recessive O
gene O
was O
also O
suggested O
by O
the O
study O
on O
cells O
from O
asymptomatic O
members O
of O
the O
family. O
