# Abstract
Midazolam B-Chemical
(MDZ) B-Chemical
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O

used O
in O

and O
in O

studies. O
The O
major O
metabolic O
pathway O
of O
MDZ B-Chemical
in O
humans B-Species
consists O
of O
the O
CYP3A4-mediated O
1'-hydroxylation O
followed O
by O

as O
1'-O-glucuronide B-Chemical
derivative. O
In O

According O
