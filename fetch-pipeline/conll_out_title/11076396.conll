# Abstract
The O
vectorial O
secretion O
of O
bile B-Chemical
salts I-Chemical
from O
blood O
into O
bile O
is O
a O
major O
driving O
force O
for O
bile O
formation. O
The O
basolateral O
hepatocyte O
membrane O
extracts O
bile B-Chemical
salts I-Chemical
from O
sinusoidal O
blood O
via O
Na(+)-dependent O
and O
Na(+)-independent O
membrane O
transporters. O
Na(+)-dependent O
uptake O
of O
bile B-Chemical
salts I-Chemical
is O
mediated O
by O
the O
Na(+)-taurocholate B-Chemical
co-transporting O
polypeptide, O
a O
51-kDa O
protein O
that O
is O
exclusively O
expressed O
in O
hepatocytes. O
Na(+)-independent O
uptake O
of O
bile B-Chemical
salts I-Chemical
is O
mediated O
by O
the O
organic O
anion O
transporting O
polypeptides, O
a O
superfamily O
of O
multispecific O
bile B-Chemical
salt I-Chemical
and O
amphipathic O
substrate O
transporters. O
Within O
the O
hepatocyte, O
bile B-Chemical
salts I-Chemical
are O
bound O
to O
cytosolic O
proteins O
and O
traverse O
the O
cell O
mainly O
by O
diffusion. O
Transport O

all O

which O
can O
cause O

of O

and O
consequently O

Canalicular O

by O
the O
multidrug B-Gene

protein I-Gene
2 I-Gene
(MRP2), B-Gene
which O
is O
strongly O
decreased O
in O
cholestasis. B-Disease
Decreased O
MRP2 B-Gene
expression O
leads O
to O
compensatory O
increases O
in O
the O
basolateral O
expression O
of O
MRP1 B-Gene
and O
MRP3, B-Gene
which O
mediate O
the O

efflux O
of O
divalent O
bile B-Chemical

conjugates O
and O
other O
organic O
anions. O
Thus, O
the O
hepatocyte O
can O
regulate O

levels O
of O
individual O
bile B-Chemical

during O
