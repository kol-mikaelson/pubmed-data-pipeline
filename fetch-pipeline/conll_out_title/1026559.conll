# Abstract
A O
comparison O
has O
been O
made O
of O
the O
urinary O
metabolites O
of O
volunteers O
who O
had O
taken O
therapeutic O
doses O
of O
paracetamol B-Chemical
with O
those O
of O
persons O
who O
had O
taken O
an O
overdose B-Disease
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
highlight O
the O
metabolic O
changes O
associated O
with O
massive O
doses. O
The O
main O
technique O
for O
examining O
urine O
samples O
was O
two-dimensional O
thin O
layer O
chromatography. O
Other O
chromatographic O
techniques O
were O
used O
for O
the O
isolation O
and O
purification O
of O
metabolites. O
The O
urinary O
metabolites O
after O
a O
therapeutic O
dose O
of O
paracetamol B-Chemical
were O
identified O
as O
free O
paracetamol, B-Chemical
paracetamol B-Chemical
sulphate, I-Chemical
3-hydroxy-paracetamol-3-sulphate, B-Chemical
3-methoxy-paracetamol B-Chemical
sulphate, I-Chemical
paracetamol B-Chemical
glucuronide, I-Chemical
3-methoxy-paracetamol B-Chemical
glucuronide, I-Chemical
paracetamol B-Chemical
3-cysteine I-Chemical
conjugate I-Chemical
and O
paracetamol B-Chemical
3-mercapturate. I-Chemical
The O
same O
metabolites O
were O
also O
present O
in O
urine O
following O
overdosage O
but O
the O
proportions O
were O
quite O
different. O
There O
was O
particularly O
a O
big O
increase O
in O
the O
relative O
amounts O
of O
cysteine O
and O
mercapturic O
acid O
conjugates O
excreted. O
No O
new O
metabolites O
were O
found. O
The O
significance O
of O
these O
findings O
is O
briefly O
discussed O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
metabolism O
and O
toxicology O
of O
paracetamol. B-Chemical
