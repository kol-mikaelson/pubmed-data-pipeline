# Abstract
BACKGROUND O
AND O
AIMS: O
It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
putrescine B-Chemical
acts O
as O
a O
growth O
factor O
in O
the O
gut, O
but O
its O
exact O
function O
in O
some O
aspects O
of O
cellular O
metabolism O
is O
still O
in O
question. O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
work O
was O
to O
identify O
some O
functions O
of O
putrescine B-Chemical
in O
small O
bowel O
metabolism. O
ANIMALS: O
Rats B-Species
(about O
80 O
g), O
in O
groups O
of O
five, O
were O
given O
either O
phytohaemagglutinin- O
or O
lactalbumin-containing O
diets, O
fed O
ad O
libitum O
or O
were O
fasted O
for O
48 O
hours O
and O
re-fed O
for O
six O
or O
twelve O
hours O
before O
being O
killed. O
METHODS: O
Uptake O
of O
intraperitoneally O
or O
intragastrically O
administered O
[14C]putrescine B-Chemical
and O
its O
conversion O
to O
succinate B-Chemical
by O
the O
rat B-Species
small O
bowel O
mucosa O
was O
measured. O
Tissue O
polyamine B-Chemical
and O
succinate B-Chemical
contents O
were O
measured O
by O
high O
performance O
liquid O
chromatography O
and O
amino O
acid O
analysis O
respectively. O
RESULTS: O
Uptake O
of O
putrescine B-Chemical
by O
the O
small O
bowel O
mucosa O
from O
the O
systemic O
circulation O
and O
conversion O
of O
about O
30% O
of O
this O
to O
succinate B-Chemical
occurs O
in O
the O
epithelium O
of O
the O
healthy O
small O
bowel. O
Compared O
with O
rats B-Species
given O
food O
ad O
libitum, O
putrescine B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
doubled O
in O
fasted O
animals O
and O
more O
than O
70% O
of O
it O
was O
converted O
to O
succinate. B-Chemical
All O
these O
changes O
returned O
to O
control O
values O
on O
refeeding. O
Using O
phytohaemagglutinin O
induced O
gut O
growth O
as O
a O
model, O
the O
uptake O
of O
putrescine B-Chemical
from O
the O
systemic O
circulation O
by O
the O
serosal O
side O
of O
the O
small O
intestinal O
epithelium O
was O
increased O
immediately O
after O
growth O
was O
stimulated. O
During O
phytohaemagglutinin O
induced O
growth O
of O
the O
gut, O
putrescine B-Chemical
was O
converted O
to O
succinate B-Chemical
in O
the O
same O
proportion O
as O
in O
the O
healthy O
small O
bowel. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
experiments O
identified O
a O
novel O
function O
for O
putrescine B-Chemical
in O
gut O
metabolism: O
it O
can O
be O
used O
as O
an O
instant O
energy O
source O
when O
required. O
