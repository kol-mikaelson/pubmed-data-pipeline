# Abstract
SLC3A2, B-Gene
a O
member O
of O
the O
solute O

family, O
was O
identified O
by O
proteomics O
methods O
as O
a O
component O
of O
a O

exporting O
the O

Knockdown O
of O
SLC3A2 B-Gene
in O
human B-Species
cells, O
using O
short O
hairpin O
RNA, O
caused O
an O
increase O

and O
a O

activity. O
SLC3A2 B-Gene

The O

was O
inhibited O
by O
high O
concentrations O

putrescine. B-Chemical
Knockdown O
of O
SLC3A2 B-Gene
reduced O
export O

Expression O
of O
SLC3A2 B-Gene
was O
suppressed O
in O
human B-Species
HCT116 B-CellLine
colon B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
cells, O
which O

compared O
with O
their O
isogenic O

Hkh2 B-CellLine
cells, O
which O

an O
activated O
K-RAS B-Gene
allele. O
Spermidine O
spermine O
N(1)-acetyltransferase O
(SAT1) B-Gene
was O
co-immunoprecipitated O
by O
an O
anti-SLC3A2 O
antibody O
as O
was O
SLC3A2 B-Gene
with O
an O
anti-SAT1 O
antibody. O
SLC3A2 B-Gene
and O
SAT1 B-Gene
colocalized O
on O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
These O
data O
provide O
the O
first O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
a O
polyamine B-Chemical
exporter O
in O
animal O
cells O
and O
indicate O
that O
the O
diamine B-Chemical
putrescine B-Chemical
is O
exported O
by O
an O
arginine B-Chemical
transporter O
containing O
SLC3A2, B-Gene
whose O
expression O
is O
negatively O
regulated O
by O
K-RAS. B-Gene
The O
interaction O
between O
SLC3A2 B-Gene
and O
SAT1 B-Gene
suggests O
that O
these O
proteins O
may O
facilitate O
excretion O
of O
acetylated B-Chemical
polyamines. I-Chemical
