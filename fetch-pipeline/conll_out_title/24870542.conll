# Abstract
The O
availability O
of O
human B-Species
genome O
sequence O
has O
transformed O
biomedical O
research O
over O
the O
past O
decade. O
However, O
an O
equivalent O
map O
for O
the O
human B-Species
proteome O
with O
direct O
measurements O
of O
proteins O
and O
peptides O
does O
not O
exist O
yet. O
Here O
we O
present O
a O
draft O
map O
of O
the O
human B-Species
proteome O
using O
high-resolution O
Fourier-transform O
mass O
spectrometry. O
In-depth O
proteomic O
profiling O
of O
30 O
histologically O
normal O
human B-Species
samples, O
including O
17 O
adult O
tissues, O
7 O
fetal O
tissues O
and O
6 O
purified O
primary O
haematopoietic O
cells, O
resulted O
in O
identification O
of O
proteins O
encoded O
by O
17,294 O
genes O
accounting O
for O
approximately O
84% O
of O
the O
total O
annotated O
protein-coding O
genes O
in O
humans. O
A O
unique O
and O
comprehensive O
strategy O
for O
proteogenomic O
analysis O
enabled O
us O
to O
discover O
a O
number O
of O
novel O
protein-coding O
regions, O
which O
includes O
translated O
pseudogenes, O
non-coding O
RNAs O
and O
upstream O
open O
reading O
frames. O
This O
large O
human B-Species
proteome O
catalogue O
(available O
as O
an O
interactive O
web-based O
resource O
at O
http: O
www.humanproteomemap.org) O
will O
complement O
available O
human B-Species
genome O
and O
transcriptome O
data O
to O
accelerate O
biomedical O
research O
in O
health O
and O
disease. O
