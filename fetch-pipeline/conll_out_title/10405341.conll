# Abstract
19R-Hydroxyprostaglandins B-Chemical
are O
major O
components O
of O
human B-Species
seminal O
fluid. O
They O
are O
apparently O
formed O
in O
the O
seminal O
vesicles O
by O
NADPH-dependent O
omega2-hydroxylation. O
The O
hydroxylase O
is O
likely O
a O
cytochrome O
P450 O
(CYP), O
which O
has O
not O
been O
identified. O
To O
address O
this O
issue O
we O
studied O
gene O
expression O
of O
CYPs O
in O
human B-Species
seminal O
vesicles O
(n O
= O
4) O
with O
reverse-transcription O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
(RT-PCR). O
CYP1B1, B-Gene
CYP2E1, B-Gene
CYP2J2, B-Gene
CYP3A5, B-Gene
CYP4B1, B-Gene
and O
CYP4B1 B-Gene
with O
insertion O
of O
three O
nucleotides O
(Ser207) O
were O
detected O
in O
all O
subjects. O
RT-PCR O
with O
degenerate O
primers O
for O
the O
CYP4 O
family O
yielded O
a O
novel O
cDNA O
sequence, O
which O
was O
derived O
from O
a O
previously O
reported O
genomic O
sequence O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
19p13.1 I-Chromosome
and O
present O
in O
all O
subjects. O
cDNA O
cloning O
showed O
that O
the O
deduced O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
consisted O
of O
520 O
amino O
acids. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
demonstrated O
mRNA O
transcripts O
of O
approximately O
2.1 O
and O
approximately O
2.3 O
kb. O
The O
deduced O
protein O
showed O
81.2 O
and O
76.7% O
amino O
acid O
identity O
with O
the O
human B-Species
enzymes O
CYP4F2 O
and O
CYP4F3. O
The O
novel O
CYP O
was O
designated O
CYP4F8. O
