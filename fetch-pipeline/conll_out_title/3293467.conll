# Abstract
Transport O
of O
the O
dipeptide B-Chemical
glycylsarcosine B-Chemical
(Gly-Sar) B-Chemical
was O
examined O
in O
isolated O
proximal O
straight O
tubules O
of O
the O
rabbit B-Species
kidney O
by O
an O
in O
vitro O
microperfusion O
technique O
to O
determine O
whether O
it O
can O
be O
actively O
transported O
intact. O
The O
unidirectional O
lumen-to-bath O
flux O
of O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
was O
measured O
by O
two O
separate O
methods, O
namely O
its O
appearance O
rate O
(JA) O
in O
the O
bathing O
fluid O
and O
its O
disappearance O
rate O
(JD) O
from O
the O
luminal O
fluid. O
In O
addition, O
the O
cell O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
concentration O
was O
measured O
immediately O
after O
the O
last O
flux O
period. O
Mean O
luminal O
fluid O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
concentration O
was O
0.22 O
mM. O
Transepithelial O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
flux O
(260.0 O
fmol.min-1.mm-1) O
was O
greater O
than O
could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
passive O
leakage, O
whereas O
cellular O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
accumulation O
(2.72 O
mM) O
was O
greater O
than O
could O
be O
attributed O
to O
passive O
equilibration O
across O
the O
luminal O
membrane. O
High-pressure O
liquid O
chromatographic O
analysis O
of O
cellular O
extract O
indicated O
that O
63% O
of O
the O
transported O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
was O
hydrolyzed O
within O
the O
cell. O
Analysis O
of O
the O
bath O
solution O
revealed O
that O
47% O
of O
the O
radioactivity O
that O
crossed O
the O
tubule O
cell O
was O
in O
the O
form O
of O
intact O
dipeptide, B-Chemical
whereas O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
radioactivity O
was O
in O
the O
form O
of O
hydrolytic O
and O
metabolic O
products O
of O
Gly-Sar. B-Chemical
This O
indicates O
that O
the O
dipeptide B-Chemical
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
is O
actively O
transported O
intact O
at O
the O
luminal O
membrane O
into O
the O
cytosol O
of O
proximal O
straight O
tubule O
cells O
with O
subsequent O
hydrolysis. O
It O
then O
exits O
across O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
as O
intact O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
and O
its O
hydrolytic O
and O
metabolic O
products. O
