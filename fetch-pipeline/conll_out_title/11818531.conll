# Abstract
The O
posttranslational O
gamma-carboxylation O
of O
glutamate B-Chemical
residues O
in O
secreted O
proteins O
to O
gamma-carboxyglutamate B-Chemical
is O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
vitamin O
K-dependent O
enzyme O
gamma-glutamyl B-Gene
carboxylase. I-Gene
gamma-Carboxylation O
has O
long O
been O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
biochemical O
specialization O
of O
vertebrates, O
essential O
for O
blood O
clotting. O
Recently, O
a O
gamma-carboxylase O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
expressed O
in O
Drosophila, B-Species
although O
its O
function O
remains O
undefined O
in O
this O
organism. O
We O
have O
characterized O
both O
cDNA O
and O
genomic O
clones O
for O
the O
gamma-glutamyl B-Gene
carboxylase I-Gene
from O
the O
marine O
mollusc, O
Conus, B-Species
the O
only O
nonvertebrate O
organism O
for O
which O
gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing O
proteins O
have O
been O
biochemically O
and O
physiologically O
characterized. O
The O
predicted O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
has O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
sequence O
similarity O
to O
the O
Drosophila B-Species
and O
vertebrate O
enzymes. O
Although O
gamma-carboxylases O
are O
highly O
conserved, O
the O
Conus B-Species
and O
mammalian B-Species
enzymes O
have O
divergent O
substrate O
specificity. O
There O
are O
striking O
parallels O
in O
the O
gene O
organization O
of O
Conus B-Species
and O
human B-Species
gamma-carboxylases. O
Of O
the O
10 O
Conus B-Species
introns O
identified, O
8 O
are O
in O
precisely O
the O
same O
position O
as O
the O
corresponding O
introns O
in O
the O
human B-Species
enzyme. O
This O
remarkable O
conservation O
of O
intron O
exon O
boundaries O
reveals O
that O
an O
intron-rich O
gamma-carboxylase O
was O
present O
early O
in O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
animal O
phyla; O
although O
specialized O
adaptations O
in O
mammals O
and O
molluscs O
that O
require O
this O
extracellular O
modification O
have O
been O
identified, O
the O
ancestral O
function(s) O
and O
wider O
biological O
roles O
of O
gamma-carboxylation O
still O
need O
to O
be O
defined. O
The O
data O
raise O
the O
possibility O
that O
most O
introns O
in O
the O
genes O
of O
both O
mammals O
and O
molluscs O
antedate O
the O
divergence O
of O
these O
phyla. O
