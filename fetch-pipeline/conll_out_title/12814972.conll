# Abstract
Midazolam, B-Chemical
triazolam B-Chemical
(TRZ), B-Chemical
testosterone, B-Chemical
and O
nifedipine B-Chemical
have O
all O
been O
widely O
used O
as O
probes O
for O
in O
vitro O
metabolism O
of O
CYP3A. B-Gene
We O
used O
these O
four O
substrates O
to O
assess O
the O
contributions O
of O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
and O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
to O

(HLMs) B-CellLine
and O
in O
recombinant O
enzymes. O
Recombinant O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
and O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
(rCYP3A4 B-CellLine
and O
rCYP3A5) O
both O
produced O
1-OH B-Chemical
and O
4-OH B-Chemical
metabolites O
from O
midazolam B-Chemical
and O
triazolam, B-Chemical

beta-hydroxytestosterone I-Chemical
from O
testosterone, B-Chemical
and O
oxidized O
nifedipine B-Chemical
from O
nifedipine. B-Chemical
Overall, O
the O
metabolic O
activity O
of O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
was O
less O
than O
that O
of O
CYP3A4. B-Gene
Ketoconazole B-Chemical

testosterone, B-Chemical
and O
nifedipine B-Chemical
metabolite O
formation O
in O
HLMs B-CellLine
and O
in O
rCYP3A4. B-CellLine
The O
inhibitory O
potency O
of O
ketoconazole B-Chemical
in O
rCYP3A5 O
was O
about O
5- O
to O
19-fold O
less O
than O
rCYP3A4 B-CellLine
for O
all O
four O
substrates. O
In O
testosterone B-Chemical
interaction O
studies, O
testosterone B-Chemical
inhibited O
1-OH-TRZ B-Chemical
formation, O
but O
significantly O
activated O
4-OH-TRZ B-Chemical
formation O
in O
HLMs B-CellLine
and O
rCYP3A4 B-CellLine
but O
not O
in O
rCYP3A5. O
Oxidized O
nifedipine B-Chemical
formation O
was O
inhibited O
by O
testosterone B-Chemical
in O
rCYP3A4. B-CellLine
However, O
in O
rCYP3A5, O
testosterone B-Chemical
slightly O
activated O
oxidized O
nifedipine B-Chemical
formation O
at O
lower O
concentrations, O
followed O
by O
inhibition. O
Thus, O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
and O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
both O
contribute O
to O
midazolam, B-Chemical
triazolam, B-Chemical
testosterone, B-Chemical
and O
nifedipine B-Chemical
biotransformation O
in O
HLMs, B-CellLine
with O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
being O
metabolically O
less O
active O
than O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
in O
general. O
Because O
the O
inhibitory O
potency O
of O
ketoconazole B-Chemical
in O
rCYP3A5 O
is O
substantially O
less O
than O
in O
rCYP3A4 B-CellLine
and O
HLMs, B-CellLine
CYP3A5 B-Gene
is O
probably O
less O
important O
than O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
in O
drug-drug O
interactions O
involving O
ketoconazole B-Chemical
and O
CYP3A B-Gene
substrates. O
