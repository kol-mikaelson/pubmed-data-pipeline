# Abstract
Sialidases O
(EC O
3.2.1.18) O
are O
a O
group O
of O
glycohydrolytic O
enzymes, O
widely O
distributed O
in O
nature, O
that O
cleave O
sialic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
residues O
from O
the O
oligosaccharide B-Chemical
components O
of O
glycoconjugates. O
All O
of O
the O
sialidase O
enzymes O
thus O
far O
characterized O
share O
an O
Asp O
block, O
repeated O
three O
to O
five O
times O
in O
the O
primary O
structure, O
and O
an O
F O
YRIP O
sequence O
motif O
that O
is O
part O
of O
the O
active O
site. O
Using O
a O
sequence O
homology-based O
approach, O
we O
have O
identified O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
gene, O
named O
NEU2, B-Gene
mapping O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
2q37. I-Chromosome
The O
nucleotide O
sequence O
analysis O
of O
the O
gene O
has O
shown O
that O
it O
contains O
only O
one O
intron O
of O
about O
1.25 O
kb, O
and O
the O
longest O
open O
reading O
frame O
encodes O
a O
protein O
of O
380 O
amino O
acids, O
with O
a O
two-Asp O
block O
consensus, O
and O
the O
YRIP O
sequence. O
In O
the O
putative O
promoter O
sequence O
there O
are O
a O
classical O
TATAA O
box O
and O
four O
E O
boxes, O
which O
are O
consensus O
binding O
sites O
for O
muscle-specific O
transcription O
factors. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
revealed O
expression O
of O
the O
NEU2 B-Gene
transcript O
only O
in O
skeletal O
muscle. O
