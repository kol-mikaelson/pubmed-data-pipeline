# Abstract
We O
used O
expression O
cloning O
to O
isolate O
cDNAs O
encoding O
a O
microsomal O
3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid B-Gene
oxidoreductase I-Gene
(C(27) B-Gene
3beta-HSD) I-Gene
that O
is O
expressed O
predominantly O
in O
the O
liver. O
The O
predicted O
product O
shares O
34% O
sequence O
identity O
with O
the O
C(19) O
and O
C(21) O
3beta-HSD B-Gene
enzymes, O
which O
participate O
in O
steroid B-Chemical
hormone I-Chemical
metabolism. O
When O
transfected O
into O
cultured O
cells, O
the O
cloned O
C(27) B-Gene
3beta-HSD I-Gene
cDNA O
encodes O
an O
enzyme O
that O
is O
active O
against O
four O
7alpha-hydroxylated B-Chemical
sterols, I-Chemical
indicating O
that O
a O
single O
C(27) B-Gene
3beta-HSD I-Gene
enzyme O
can O
participate O
in O
all O
known O
pathways O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthesis. O
The O
expressed O
enzyme O
did O
not O
metabolize O
several O
different O

as O
substrates. O
The O

the O
mouse B-Species
are O
not O

The O

on O
chromosome O
16p11.2-12 O
contains O
six O
exons O
and O
spans O
3 O
kb O
of O
DNA, O
and O
we O
identified O
a O
2-bp O

of O
a O

This O
mutation O
eliminates O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
enzyme O
in O
transfected O
cells. O
These O
findings O
establish O
the O
central O
role O
of O
C(27) B-Gene
3beta-HSD I-Gene
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
