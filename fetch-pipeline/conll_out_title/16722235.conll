# Abstract
The O
extraneuronal B-Gene
monoamine B-Chemical
transporter I-Gene
(EMT) B-Gene
corresponds O
to O
the O
classical O
steroid-sensitive O
monoamine B-Chemical
transport O
mechanism O
that O
was O
first O
described O
as O
"uptake2" O
in O
rat B-Species
heart O
with O
noradrenaline B-Chemical
as O
substrate. O
The O
organic O
cation O
transporters O
OCT1 B-Gene
and O
OCT2 B-Gene
are O
related O
to O
EMT. B-Gene
The O
three O
carriers O
share O
basic O
structural O
and O
functional O
characteristics. O
Hence, O
EMT, B-Gene
OCT1 B-Gene
and O
OCT2 B-Gene
constitute O
a O
group O
referred O
to O
as O
non-neuronal O
monoamine B-Chemical
transporters O
or O
organic O
cation O
transporters. O
After O
a O
brief O
general O
introduction, O
this O
review O
focuses O
on O
the O
critical O
analysis O
of O
substrate O
specificity. O
We O
calculate O
from O
the O
available O
literature O
and O
compare O
consensus O
transport O
efficiency O
(clearance) O
data O
for O
human B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
EMT, B-Gene
OCT1 B-Gene
and O
OCT2, B-Gene
expressed O
in O
transfected O
cell O
lines. O
From O
the O
plethora O
of O
inhibitors O
that O
have O
been O
tested, O
the O
casual O
observer O
likely O
gets O
the O
impression O
that O
these O
carriers O
indiscriminately O
transport O
very O
many O
compounds. O
However, O
our O
knowledge O
about O
actual O
substrates O
is O
rather O
limited. O
1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium B-Chemical
(MPP+) O
is O
an O
excellent O
substrate O
for O
all O
three O
carriers, O
with O
clearances O
typically O
in O
the O
range O
of O
20-50 O
microl O
min(-1) O
mg O
protein(-1). O
The O
second-best O
general O
substrate O
is O
tyramine B-Chemical
with O
a O
transport O
efficiency O
(TE) O
range O
relative O
to O
MPP+ O
of O
20%-70%. O
The O
TEs O
of O
OCT1 B-Gene
and O
OCT2 B-Gene
for O
dopamine, B-Chemical
noradrenaline, B-Chemical
adrenaline B-Chemical
and O
5-HT B-Chemical
in O
general O
are O
rather O
low, O
in O
the O
range O
relative O
to O
MPP+ O
of O
5%-15%. O
This O
suggests O
that O
OCT1 B-Gene
and O
OCT2 B-Gene
are O
not O
primarily O
dedicated O
to O
transport O
these O
monoamine B-Chemical
transmitters; O
only O
EMT B-Gene
may O
play O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
catecholamine B-Chemical
inactivation. O
For O
many O
substrates, O
such O
as O
tetraethylammonium, B-Chemical
histamine, B-Chemical
agmatine, B-Chemical
guanidine, B-Chemical
cimetidine, B-Chemical
creatinine, B-Chemical
choline B-Chemical
and O
acetylcholine, B-Chemical
the O
transport O
efficiencies O
are O
markedly O
different O
among O
the O
carriers. O
