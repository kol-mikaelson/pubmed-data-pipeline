# Abstract
ASCT1 B-Gene
protein O
is O
a O
member O
of O
the O
glutamate B-Chemical
transporter O
superfamily, O
which O
shows O
system O
ASC O

and O
has O
been O
characterized O
as O
a O
Na+-dependent O
neutral O
amino-acid O
exchanger. O
Here, O
by O

Our O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
ASCT1 B-Gene
is O
able O
to O
mediate O
a O
concentrative O
transport O
of O
alanine, B-Chemical
which O
is O
Na+-dependent O
