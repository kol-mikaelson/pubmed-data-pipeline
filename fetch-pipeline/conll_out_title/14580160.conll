# Abstract
Prolidases O
I O
and O
II O
were O
highly O
purified O
from O
human B-Species
erythrocytes. O
The O
effects O
of O
various O
amino O
acids, O
MnCl2 B-Chemical
and O
mercaptoethanol, B-Chemical
on O
these O
two O
enzymes O
were O
investigated. O
Normal O
prolidase B-Gene
II O
was O
very O
labile O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
MnCl2 B-Chemical
or O
mercaptoethanol. B-Chemical
The O
activity O
of O
prolidase B-Gene
II O
was O
maintained O
at O
about O
76% O
by O
pre-incubation O
with O
MnCl2; B-Chemical
it O
was O
then O
activated O
up O
to O
140% O
by O
treatment O
with O
mercaptoethanol B-Chemical
for O
60 O
minutes O
at O
37 O
degrees O
C. O
Normal O
prolidases O
I O
and O
II O
showed O
the O
highest O
activity O
against O
glycylproline B-Chemical
or O
methionylproline B-Chemical
in O
the O
presence O
of O
MnCl2. B-Chemical
The O
activity O
of O
prolidase B-Gene
I O
against O
glycylproline B-Chemical
was O
enhanced O
strongly O
by O
glycine B-Chemical
and O
MnCl2, B-Chemical
but O
not O
activated O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
MnCl2. B-Chemical
The O
activity O
of O
prolidase B-Gene
II O
against O
methionylproline B-Chemical
was O
enhanced O
three-fold O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
glycine B-Chemical
and O
MnCl2, B-Chemical
but O
its O
activity O
against O
glycylproline B-Chemical
was O
very O
low O
even O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
MnCl2. B-Chemical
A O
stronger O
enhancement O
of O
this O
activity O
was O
found O
in O
normal O
erythrocytes, O
and O
a O
lower O
level O
of O
this O
activity O
was O
found O
in O
erythrocytes O
of O
patients B-Species
treated O
with O
glycine, B-Chemical
MnCl2 B-Chemical
and O
mercaptoethanol B-Chemical
compared O
to O
those O
treated O
with O
glycine B-Chemical
and O
MnCl2. B-Chemical
The O
activity O
of O
prolidase B-Gene
II O
against O
methionylproline B-Chemical
in O
all O
erythrocytes, O
of O
normal O
humans B-Species
and O
of O
patients, B-Species
was O
strongly O
activated O
by O
the O
addition O
of O
glycine B-Chemical
with O
MnCl2 B-Chemical
but O
suppressed O
by O
the O
addition O
of O
mercaptoethanol. B-Chemical
