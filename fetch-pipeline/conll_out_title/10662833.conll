# Abstract
Light O
causes O
a O
rapid O
lowering O
of O
cytosolic O
free O
calcium B-Chemical
in O
the O
outer O
segments O
of O
both O
retinal O
rod O
and O
cone O
photoreceptors. O
This O
light-induced O
lowering O
of O
calcium B-Chemical
is O
caused O
by O
extrusion O
via O
a O
Na-Ca B-Gene
exchanger I-Gene
located O
in O
the O
rod O
and O
cone O
outer O
segment O
plasma O
membrane O
and O
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
the O
process O
of O
light O
adaptation. O
The O
Na-Ca B-Gene
exchanger I-Gene
in O
retinal O
rod O
outer O
segment O
was O
shown O
earlier O

a O
novel O
Na-Ca+K B-Gene
