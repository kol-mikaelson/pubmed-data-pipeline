# Abstract
Fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation O
was O
investigated O
in O
highly O
purified O
mitochondrial O
and O
peroxisomal O
preparations O
from O
rat B-Species
liver. O
Under O
isotonic O
conditions, O
pristanic B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
homophytanic I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation O
in O
purified O
peroxisomes O
was O
severalfold O
greater O
compared O
to O
the O
oxidation O
in O
purified O
mitochondria. O
Branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation O
in O
purified O
mitochondria O
was O
very O
low, O
and O
the O
oxidation O
was O
not O
stimulated O
by O
exogenous O
L-carnitine B-Chemical
or O
L-malate. B-Chemical
In O
contrast, O
stearic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation O
by O
purified O
mitochondria O
depended O
upon O
exogenous O
L-carnitine, B-Chemical
and O
the O
oxidation O
was O
stimulated O
by O
L-malate. B-Chemical
Both O
mitochondrial O
and O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation O
of O
branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
was O
strongly O
inhibited O
by O
fatty O
acid-free O
bovine B-Species
serum I-Species
albumin, I-Species
whereas O
stearic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
was O
either O
unaffected O
or O
slightly O
inhibited O
by O
bovine B-Species
serum I-Species
albumin. I-Species
The O
results O
presented O
clearly O
indicate O
that O
branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
mainly O
degraded O
in O
peroxisomes O
in O
rat B-Species
liver. O
Branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
efficiently O
converted O
to O
coenzyme B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
thioesters I-Chemical
by O
purified O
mitochondria, O
peroxisomes, O
and O
microsomes. O
Although O
pristanic B-Chemical
and O
phytanic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
rapidly O
converted O
to O
pristanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
and O
phytanoyl-CoA, B-Chemical
respectively, O
they O
were O
not O
converted O
to O
carnitine B-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
by O
mitochondrial O
outer O
membranes. O
The O
results O
indicate O
that O
acyl-CoA O
synthetase O
and O
carnitine O
acyltransferase O
located O
at O
the O
mitochondrial O
outer O
membranes O
regulate O
entry O
of O
branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
into O
mitochondria. O
Mitochondrial O
carnitine O
acyltransferase O
I O
appears O
to O
be O
highly O
specific O
for O
straight B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
restricts O
entry O
of O
branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
into O
mitochondria. O
Thus, O
branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
which O
cannot O
be O
transported O
across O
the O
mitochondrial O
membranes O
via O
the O
carnitine O
acyltransferase O
system O
are O
directed O
to O
peroxisomes O
for O
beta-oxidation. O
The O
results O
reported O
indicate O
that O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
the O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
which O
can O
be O
initially O
degraded O
by O
alpha-oxidation O
due O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
beta-methyl O
group O
in O
the O
molecule, O
cannot O
be O
transported O
across O
the O
mitochondrial O
membranes. O
The O
data O
presented O
strongly O
suggest O
that O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
alpha-oxidation O
occurs O
in O
organelles O
other O
than O
mitochondria O
and O
possibly O
in O
peroxisomes. O
