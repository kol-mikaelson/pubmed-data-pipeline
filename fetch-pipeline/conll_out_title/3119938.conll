# Abstract
To O
date, O
seven O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
of I-Disease
mitochondrial I-Disease
fatty I-Disease
acid I-Disease
oxidation I-Disease
have O
been O
identified. O
A O
total O
of O
about O
100 O
patients B-Species
in O
the O
world O
have O
been O
reported. O
Clinically O
the O
beta-oxidation O
defects O
are O
more O
often O
characterized O
by O
episodic O
hypoglycaemia B-Disease
leading O
to O
a O
coma B-Disease
mimicking O
Reye's B-Disease
syndrome. I-Disease
The O
hypoglycaemia B-Disease
is O
non-ketotic O
since O
the O
synthesis O
of O
ketone B-Chemical
bodies I-Chemical
is O
deficient. O
Periods O
of O
decompensation O
occur O
when O
carbohydrate B-Chemical
supply O
is O
poor, O
e.g. O
prolonged O
fasting, O
vomiting, B-Disease
or O
increased O
caloric O
requirements, O
as O
and O
when O
lipid B-Chemical
stores O
are O
used. O
Defects O
in O
beta-oxidation O
have O
also O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
one O
cause O
of O
sudden B-Disease
infant I-Disease
death I-Disease
syndrome. I-Disease
The O
diagnosis O
of O
these O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
is O
by O
biochemical O
investigation O
since O
where O
symptoms O
suggest O
such O
a O
defect, O
the O
precise O
aetiology O
cannot O
be O
assessed. O
The O
biochemical O
diagnosis O
is O
based O
firstly O
on O
identification O
of O
abnormal O
plasma O
and O
of O
urinary O
metabolites O
during O
acute O
attacks. O
Derivatives O
of O
the O
omega-oxidation O
and O
omega-1-oxidation O
of O
medium B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
have O
been O
identified, O
as O
well O
as O
acylglycine B-Chemical
and O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
conjugates. O
These O
metabolites O
are O
nearly O
always O
absent O
when O
patients B-Species
are O
in O
good O
clinical O
condition. O
Secondly, O
the O
diagnosis O
must O
be O
based O
on O
the O
identification O
of O
the O
enzymatic O
defects: O
this O
involves O
global O
assays O
which O
allow O
a O
localization O
of O
the O
'level' O
of O
the O
defect O
(i.e. O
the O
oxidation O
of O
long, O
medium O
or O
short O
chain O
fatty B-Chemical
acids) I-Chemical
and O
specific O
measurement O
of O
enzyme O
activities O
(acyl-CoA O
dehydrogenases O
and O
electron O
carriers: O
ETF B-Gene
and O
ETF-DH). B-Gene
The O
diagnosis O
of O
these O
disorders O
is O
of O
prime O
importance O
because O
of O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
clinical O
symptoms. O
These O
can O
be O
prevented, O
in O
some O
cases, O
by O
an O
appropriate O
diet O
(a O
high O
carbohydrate, B-Chemical
low O
fat O
diet, O
sometimes O
supplemented O
with O
L-carnitine). O
In O
other O
cases, O
genetic O
counselling O
can O
be O
offered. O
