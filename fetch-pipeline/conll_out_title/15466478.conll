# Abstract
The O
degradation O
of O
elaidic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(9-trans-octadecenoic B-Chemical
acid), I-Chemical
oleic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
stearic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
by O
rat B-Species
mitochondria O
was O
studied O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
trans O
double O
bond O
in O
place O
of O
a O
cis O
double O
bond O
or O
no O
double O
bond O
affects O
beta-oxidation. O
Rat B-Species
mitochondria O
from O
liver O
or O
heart O
effectively O
degraded O
the O
coenzyme B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
derivatives O
of O
all O
three O
fatty B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
However, O
with O
elaidoyl-CoA B-Chemical
as O
a O
substrate, O
a O
major O
metabolite O
accumulated O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix. O
This O
metabolite O
was O
isolated O
and O
identified O
as O
5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA. B-Chemical
In O
contrast, O
little O
or O
none O
of O
the O
corresponding O
metabolites O
were O
detected O
with O
oleoyl-CoA B-Chemical
or O
stearoyl-CoA B-Chemical
as O
substrates. O
A O
kinetic O
study O
of O
long-chain B-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(LCAD) B-Gene
and O
very B-Gene
long-chain I-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
revealed O
that O
5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA B-Chemical
is O
a O
poorer O
substrate O
of O
LCAD B-Gene
than O
is O
5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA, B-Chemical
while O
both O
unsaturated B-Chemical
acyl-CoAs I-Chemical
are O
poor O
substrates O
of O
very B-Gene
long-chain I-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
when O
compared O
with O
myristoyl-CoA. B-Chemical
Tetradecenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
tetradecenoylcarnitine B-Chemical
were O
detected O
by O
gas O
chromatography O
mass O
spectrometry O
and O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry, O
respectively, O
when O
rat B-Species
liver O
mitochondria O
were O
incubated O
with O
elaidoyl-CoA B-Chemical
but O
not O
when O
oleoyl-CoA B-Chemical
was O
the O
substrate. O
These O
observations O
support O
the O
conclusion O
that O
5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA B-Chemical
accumulates O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix, O
because O
it O
is O
less O
efficiently O
dehydrogenated O
by O
LCAD B-Gene
than O
is O
its O
cis O
isomer O
and O
that O
the O
accumulation O
of O
this O
beta-oxidation O
intermediate O
facilitates O
its O
hydrolysis O
and O
conversion O
to O
5-trans-tetradecenoylcarnitine B-Chemical
thereby O
permitting O
a O
partially O
degraded O
fatty O
acid O
to O
escape O
from O
mitochondria. O
Analysis O
of O
this O
compromised O
but O
functional O
process O
provides O
insight O
into O
the O
operation O
of O
beta-oxidation O
in O
intact O
mitochondria. O
