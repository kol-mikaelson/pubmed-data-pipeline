# Abstract
myo-inositol B-Chemical
is O
a O
growth O
factor O
for O
mammalian O
cells O
as O
well O
as O
for O
the O
pathogenic O
protozoa O
Trypanosoma B-Species
cruzi. I-Species
Most O
of O
the O
cell O
surface O
molecules O
in O
this O
organism O
rely O
on O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
as O
the O
biosynthetic O
precursor O
for O
phosphoinositides B-Chemical
and O
glycosylated O
phosphatidylinositols. B-Chemical
The O
aim O
of O
this O
work O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
process O
of O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
translocation O
across O
the O
parasite O
cell O
membrane. O
myo-Inositol B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
concentration-dependent O
in O
the O
concentration O
range O
0.1-10 O
microM O
with O
maximal O
transport O
obtained O
at O
8 O
microM. O
Using O
sodium-free O
buffers, O
where O
Na+ O
was O
replaced O
by O
choline B-Chemical
or O
K+, O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
inhibited O
by O
50%. O
Furosemide, B-Chemical
an O
inhibitor O
of O
the O
ouabain-insensitive O
Na+-ATPase, O
inhibited O
the O
Na+-dependent O
and O
Na+-independent O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
68 O
and O
33%, O
respectively. O
In O
contrast, O
ouabain, B-Chemical
an O
(Na++ O
K+) O
ATPase O
inhibitor, O
did O
not O
affect O
transport. O
Part O
of O
the O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
uptake O
is O
mediated O
by O
active O
transport O
as O
it O
was O
inhibited O
when O
energy O

p-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone I-Chemical
(34%), O
2,4-dinitrophenol B-Chemical
(50%), O
KCN B-Chemical
(71%) O
and O
NaN3 B-Chemical
(69%) O
were O
added O
to O
the O
medium, O
or O
the O
temperature O
of O
the O

was O
lowered O
to O
4 O
degrees O
C. O
The O
addition O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
(5-50 O
mM) O
or O
mannose B-Chemical
(10 O
mM) O
did O
not O
change O
the O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
uptake, O
whereas O
the O
addition O
of O
10 O
mM O
nonlabeled O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
totally O
inhibited O
this O
transport, O
indicating O
that O
the O
transporter O
is O
specific O
for O
myo-inositol. B-Chemical
Phloretin B-Chemical
(0.3 O
mM) O
and O
phoridzin B-Chemical
(5 O
mM), O
but O
not O
cytochalasin B-Chemical
B, I-Chemical
were O
efficient O
inhibitors O
of O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
uptake. O
A O
portion O
of O
the O
accumulated O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
is O
converted O
to O
inositol B-Chemical
phosphates I-Chemical
and O
phosphoinositides. B-Chemical
These O
data O
show O
that O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
