# Abstract
The O

succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid B-Gene
CoA I-Gene
transferase I-Gene
(SCOT; B-Gene
locus O

is O
the O
main O

of O
the O

Hereditary B-Disease
SCOT B-Gene
deficiency I-Disease
causes O
episodic O
ketoacidosis. B-Disease
Here O
we O
describe O
the O
human B-Species
SCOT B-Gene
gene, O
which O
spans O
more O
than O
100 O
kb O
and O
contains O
17 O
exons, O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
5p13. I-Chromosome
We O
report O

in O
three O
SCOT-deficient B-Disease
patients B-Species
designated O
GS04, O
05, O
and O

GS04 O
is O
a O
G219E B-ProteinMutation
G324E B-ProteinMutation
compound; O
GS05 B-Chemical
is O
a O
V221M B-ProteinMutation
homozygote, O
and O
GS06 O
is O
a O
G324E B-ProteinMutation

We O
constructed O
a O
tertiary O

model O
of O
human B-Species

based O
on O
the O

The O
model O
predicts O
that O
V221 B-ProteinMutation
and O
G219 B-ProteinMutation
are O
on O
the O
dimerizing O
surface, O
whereas O
G324 B-ProteinMutation
is O
near O
the O
active O
site. O
SCOT B-Gene
activity O
was O
reduced O
to O
a O

all O
three O

in O
SCOT-deficient B-Disease
fibroblasts, O
cDNAs O
containing O
G219E B-ProteinMutation
and O
G324E B-ProteinMutation
produced O
no O
detectable O
activity, O
whereas O
V221M B-ProteinMutation

approximately O
10% O
of O
the O
control O
peptide O

Interestingly, O
GS05 B-Chemical
