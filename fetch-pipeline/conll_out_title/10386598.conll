# Abstract
The O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
of O
Fuc-TIX B-Gene
is O
very O
highly O
conserved O
between O
mouse B-Species
and O
human. B-Species
The O
number O
of O
non-synonymous O
nucleotide O
substitutions O
of O
the O
Fuc-TIX B-Gene
gene O
between O
human B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
was O
strikingly O
low, O
and O
almost O
equivalent O
to O
that O
of O
the O
alpha-actin B-Gene
gene. O
This O
indicates O
that O
Fuc-TIX B-Gene
is O
under O
a O
strong O
selective O
pressure O
of O
preservation O
during O
evolution. O
The O
human B-Species
Fuc-TIX B-Gene
(hFuc-TIX) O
showed O
a O
unique O
characteristics, O
i.e. O
hFuc-TIX O
was O
not O
activated O
by O
Mn2+ O
and O
Co2+, O
whereas O
hFuc-TIV O
and O
hFuc-TVI O
were O
activated O
by O
the O
cations. O
The O
hFuc-TIX O
transcripts O
were O
abundantly O
expressed O
in O
brain O
and O
stomach, O
and O
interestingly O
were O
detected O
in O
spleen O
and O
peripheral O
blood O
leukocytes. O
