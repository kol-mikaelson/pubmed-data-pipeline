# Abstract
This O
hypothesis O
proposes O
a O
physiological O
role O
for O
uncoupling B-Gene
protein-3 I-Gene
(UCP3) B-Gene
in O
the O
export O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
anions O
from O
muscle O
and O
brown O
adipose O
tissue O
(BAT) O
mitochondria O
when O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
the O
predominant O
substrate O
being O
used. O
It O
proposes O
that O
excess O
acyl B-Chemical
CoA I-Chemical
within O
the O
mitochondria O
is O
hydrolyzed O
by O
a O
mitochondrial O
acyl B-Chemical
CoA I-Chemical
thioesterase, O
yielding O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
anion I-Chemical
and O
CoASH. B-Chemical
The O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
anion I-Chemical
is O
exported O
to O
the O
cytosol O
by O
being O
carried O
across O
the O
inner O
mitochondrial O
membrane O
by O
UCP3. B-Gene
The O
CoASH B-Chemical
is O
conserved O
within O
the O
mitochondrion O
to O
participate O
in O
other O
reactions O
for O
which O
it O
is O
needed O
during O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
in O
the O
beta-oxidation O
cycle O
and O
in O
the O
tricarboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
cycle. O
The O
export O
of O
the O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
anion I-Chemical
thus O
permits O
continued O
rapid O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
in O
the O
face O
of O
an O
oversupply. O
The O
hypothesis O
provides O
a O
logical O
explanation O
for O
the O
observed O
up-regulation O
of O
gene O
expression O
for O
UCP3 B-Gene
in O
muscle O
when O
there O
is O
a O
switch O
to O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation, O
as O
during O
fasting, O
and O
in O
BAT O
when O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
is O
stimulated, O
as O
during O
exposure O
to O
cold. O
It O
provides O
a O
plausible O
physiological O
role O
for O
UCP3 B-Gene
as O
a O
transporter O
protein, O
not O
as O
an O
uncoupling O
protein. O
