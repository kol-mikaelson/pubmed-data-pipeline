# Abstract
SSADH B-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
a O
rare O
inborn B-Disease
error I-Disease
of I-Disease
human I-Disease
metabolism, I-Disease
disrupts O
the O
normal O
metabolism O
of O
the O
inhibitory O
neurotransmitter O
GABA. B-Chemical
In O
response O
to O
the O
defect, O
physiologic O
fluids O
from O
patients B-Species
accumulate O
GHB, O
a O
compound O
with O
numerous O
neuromodulatory O
properties. O
Clinical O
and O
bio-chemical O
findings O
in O
patients B-Species
are O
contrasted O
with O
existing O
neuropharmacologic O
data O

GHB O

and O
men. B-Species
We O
conclude O
that O
GHB O
contributes O
to O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
SSADH B-Disease
deficiency; I-Disease
whether O
this O
effect O
is O
mediated O

metabolic O
interconversion, O
or O
via O
synergistic O
mechanisms O
by O
both O
compounds, O
remains O
to O
be O
determined. O
An O
animal O
model O
of O
SSADH B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
should O
further O
define O
the O
role O
of O
GHB O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
SSADH B-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
and O
provide O
a O
