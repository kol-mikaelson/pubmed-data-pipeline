# Abstract
A O
mutant O
of O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae I-Species
deficient O
in O
the O
lactate-proton O
symport O
was O
isolated. O
Transformation O
of O
the O
mutant O
with O
a O
yeast B-Species
genomic O
library O
allowed O
the O
isolation O
of O
the O
gene O
JEN1 B-Gene
that O
restored O
lactate B-Chemical
transport. O
Disruption O
of O
JEN1 B-Gene
abolished O
uptake O
of O
lactate. B-Chemical
The O
results O
indicate O
that, O
under O
the O
experimental O
conditions O
tested, O
no O
other O
monocarboxylate B-Chemical
permease O
is O
able O
to O
efficiently O
transport O
lactate B-Chemical
in O
S. O
cerevisiae. O
