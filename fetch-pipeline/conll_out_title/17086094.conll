# Abstract
We O
examined O
effects O
of O
a O
physiologic O
concentration O
of O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
(0.01 O
micromol O
L) O
on O
oxidant-induced O
apoptosis O
in O
cultured O
human B-Species
vascular O
smooth O
muscle O
cells O
(VSMCs). O
Apoptosis O
was O
induced O
in O
VSMCs O
by O
hydrogen B-Chemical
peroxide I-Chemical
(H2O2, B-Chemical
300 O
micromol O
L), O
as O
evidenced O
by O
in O
situ O
nick O
end-labeling O
and O
scanning O
electron O
microscopy. O
This O
apoptotic O
response O
was O
accompanied O
by O
increased O
activation O
of O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinases O
(MAPKs--ie, O
increases O
in O
the O
phosphorylated O

of O
extracellular O
signal-regulated O
kinase O
(p-ERK), O
c-Jun O
N-terminal O
kinase O
(p-JNK), O
and O
p38 O
MAPK O
(p-p38 O
MAPK). O
Although O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
alone O
did O
not O
induce O
VSMC O
death, O
pretreatment O
with O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
significantly O
enhanced O
H2O2-induced O
apoptosis O
and O
prolonged O
activation O
of O
JNK B-Gene
and O
p38 O
MAPK O
(for O
up O

but O
not O
ERK. B-Gene
Expression O
of O
MAPK B-Gene
phosphatase-1 I-Gene
(MKP-1) B-Gene
also O
was O
upregulated O
by O
H2O2, B-Chemical
but O
this O
was O
not O
affected O
by O
pitavastatin. B-Chemical
The O
apoptosis O
accelerating O
effect O
was O
observed O
also O
in O
simvastatin B-Chemical
but O
not O
in O
pravastatin. B-Chemical
Treating O
VSMCs O
with O
mevalonate, B-Chemical
farnesyl B-Chemical
pyrophosphate, I-Chemical
or O
geranylgeranyl B-Chemical
pyrophosphate I-Chemical
completely O
blocked O
the O
statin-induced O
enhancement O
of O
VSMC O
apoptosis, O
suggesting O
that O
protein O
prenylation O
is O
critically O
involved. O
It O
thus O
appears O
that O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
enhances O
H2O2-induced O
VSMC O
apoptosis, O
at O
least O
in O
part, O
via O
increases O
in O
MAPK O
activation O
and O
protein O
prenylation, O
but O
independently O
of O
MKP-1 B-Gene
expression, O
which O
consequently O
results O
in O
reduction O
of O
VSMC O
population. O
