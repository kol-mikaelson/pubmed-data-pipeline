# Abstract
We O
describe O
four O
Italian O
male O
infants O
with O
a O
novel O
clinical O
phenotype O
characterized O
by O
orthostatic B-Disease
acrocyanosis, I-Disease
relapsing O
petechiae, B-Disease
chronic O
diarrhea, B-Disease
progressive O
pyramidal B-Disease
signs, O
mental B-Disease
retardation, I-Disease
and O
brain O
magnetic B-Disease
resonance I-Disease
imaging I-Disease
abnormalities. I-Disease
The O
first O
symptoms O
appeared O
after O
the O
termination O
of O
breast-feeding O
and O
introduction O
of O
formula O
feeding. O
Marked O
persistent O
2-ethylmalonic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
was O
associated O
with O
abnormal O
excretion O
of O
C4-C5(n-butyryl-, B-Chemical
isobutyryl-, I-Chemical
isovaleryl-, I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
2-methylbutyryl-)acylglycines I-Chemical
and O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
and O
with O
intermittent O
lactic B-Disease
acidosis. I-Disease
Short- O
and O
branched-chain O
plasma O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
levels O
were O
also O
elevated. O
2-Ethylmalonic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
is O
generally O
regarded O
as O
being O
indicative O
of O
a O
defect O
in O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation. O
Extensive O
studies O
of O
cultured O
fibroblasts O
failed O
to O
reveal O
such O
a O
defect. O
The O
observation O
of O
intermittent O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
2-ethylhydracrylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
pointed O
to O
involvement O
of O
the O
isoleucine B-Chemical
R O
pathway O
in O
ethylmalonate B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
This O
hypothesis O
was O
tentatively O
corroborated O
by O
the O
biochemical O
responses O
to O
an O
oral O
isoleucine B-Chemical
challenge O
in O
two O
patients. B-Species
However, O
fibroblast O
studies O
showed O
normal O
oxidation O
rates O
of O
(14C)isoleucine B-Chemical
(ul), O
indicating O
that O
this O
is O
not O
a O
defect O
of O
isoleucine B-Chemical
oxidation O
expressed O
in O
skin O
fibroblasts. O
In O
one O
of O
two O
patients B-Species
tested, O
cytochrome O
c O
oxidase O
activity O
was O
partially O
reduced O
(45%) O
in O
cultured O
fibroblasts. O
This O
unique O
clinical O
and O
biochemical O
phenotype O
identifies O
a O
new O
metabolic O
encephalopathy O
of O
yet O
undetermined O
cause. O
