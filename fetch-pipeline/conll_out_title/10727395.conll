# Abstract
Tetrahydrobiopterin B-Chemical
(BH(4)) B-Chemical
cofactor O
is O
essential O
for O
various O
processes, O
and O
is O
present O
in O
probably O
every O
cell O
or O
tissue O
of O
higher O
organisms. O
BH(4) B-Chemical
is O
required O
for O
various O
enzyme O
activities, O
and O
for O
less O
defined O
functions O
at O
the O
cellular O
level. O
The O
pathway O
for O
the O
de O
novo O
biosynthesis O
of O
BH(4) B-Chemical
from O
GTP B-Chemical
involves O
GTP B-Gene
cyclohydrolase I-Gene
I, I-Gene
6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
and O
sepiapterin B-Gene
reductase. I-Gene
Cofactor O
regeneration O
requires O
pterin-4a-carbinolamine O
dehydratase O
and O
dihydropteridine B-Gene
reductase. I-Gene
Based O
on O
gene O
cloning, O
recombinant O
expression, O
mutagenesis O
studies, O
structural O
analysis O
of O
crystals O
and O
NMR O
studies, O
reaction O
mechanisms O
for O
the O
biosynthetic O
and O
recycling O
enzymes O
were O
proposed. O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
regulation O
of O
cofactor O
biosynthesis, O
the O
major O
controlling O
point O
is O
GTP B-Gene
cyclohydrolase I-Gene
I, I-Gene
the O
expression O
of O
which O
may O
be O
under O
the O
control O
of O
cytokine O
induction. O
In O
the O
liver O
at O
least, O
activity O
is O
inhibited O
by O
BH(4), B-Chemical
but O
stimulated O
by O
phenylalanine B-Chemical
through O
the O
GTP B-Gene
cyclohydrolase I-Gene
I I-Gene
feedback O
regulatory O
protein. O
The O
enzymes O
that O
depend O
on O
BH(4) B-Chemical
are O
the O
phenylalanine, B-Chemical
tyrosine O
and O
tryptophan O
hydroxylases, O
the O
latter O
two O
being O
the O
rate-limiting O
enzymes O
for O
catecholamine B-Chemical
and O
5-hydroxytryptamine B-Chemical
(serotonin) B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
all O
NO O

isoforms O
and O
the O
glyceryl-ether B-Gene
mono-oxygenase. I-Gene
On O
a O
cellular O
level, O
BH(4) B-Chemical
has O
been O
found O
to O
be O
a O
growth O
or O
proliferation O
factor O
for O
Crithidia B-Species
fasciculata, I-Species
haemopoietic O
cells O
and O
various O
mammalian O
cell O
lines. O
In O
the O
nervous O
system, O
BH(4) B-Chemical
is O
a O
self-protecting O
factor O
for O
NO, O
or O
a O
general O
neuroprotecting O
factor O
via O
the O
NO O
synthase O
pathway, O
and O
has O
neurotransmitter-releasing O
function. O
With O
regard O
to O
human B-Species
disease, O
BH(4) B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
due O
to O
autosomal O
recessive O
mutations O
in O
all O
enzymes O
(except O
sepiapterin B-Gene
reductase) I-Gene
have O
been O
described O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
hyperphenylalaninaemia. B-Disease
Furthermore, O
several O
neurological B-Disease
diseases, I-Disease
including O
Dopa-responsive B-Disease
dystonia, I-Disease
but O
also O
Alzheimer's B-Disease
disease, I-Disease
Parkinson's B-Disease

autism B-Disease
and O
depression, B-Disease
have O
been O
suggested O
