# Abstract
15-Lipoxygenase O
2 O
(15-LOX2) B-Gene
is O
a O
recently O
cloned O
human B-Species
lipoxygenase O
that O
shows O
tissue-restricted O
expression O
in O
prostate, O
lung, O
skin, O
and O
cornea. O
The O
protein O
level O
and O
enzymatic O
activity O
of O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
have O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
down-regulated O
in O
prostate B-Disease
cancers I-Disease
compared O
with O
normal O
and O
benign O
prostate O
tissues. O
The O
biological O
function O
of O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
and O
the O
role O
of O
loss O
of O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
expression O
in O
prostate B-Disease
tumorigenesis, I-Disease
however, O
remain O
unknown. O
We O
report O
the O
cloning O
and O
functional O
characterization O
of O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
and O
its O
three O
splice O
variants O
(termed O
15-LOX2sv-a, O
15-LOX2sv-b, O
and O
15-LOX2sv-c) O
from O
primary O
prostate O
epithelial O
cells. O
Western O
blotting O
with O
multiple O
primary O
prostate O
cell O
strains O
and O
prostate B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
cell O
lines O
reveals O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
is O
lost O
in O
all O
prostate B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
cell O
lines, O
accompanied O
by O
decreased O
enzymatic O
activity O
revealed O
by O
liquid O
chromatography O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
analyses. O
Further O
experiments O
show O
that O
the O
loss O
of O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
expression O
results O
from O
transcriptional O
repression O
caused O
by O
mechanism(s) O
other O
than O
promoter O
hypermethylation O
or O
histone O
deacetylation. O
Subsequent O
functional O
studies O
indicate O
the O
following: O
1) O
the O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
product, O
15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
inhibits O
prostate B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
cell O
cycle O
progression; O
2) O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
expression O
in O
primary O
prostate O
epithelial O
cells O
is O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
cell O
cycle; O
and O
3) O
restoration O
of O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
expression O
in O
prostate B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
cells O
partially O
inhibits O
cell O
cycle O
progression. O
Taken O
together, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
15-LOX2 B-Gene
could O
be O
a O
suppressor O
of O
prostate B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
development, O
which O
functions O
by O
restricting O
cell O
cycle O
progression. O
