# Abstract
Autosomal B-Disease
dominant I-Disease
medullary I-Disease
cystic I-Disease
kidney I-Disease
disease I-Disease
(ADMCKD) B-Disease
is O
an O
adult-onset O
heterogeneous O
genetic O
nephropathy B-Disease
characterized O
by O
salt B-Chemical
wasting I-Disease
and O
end-stage B-Disease
renal I-Disease
failure. I-Disease
The O
gene O
responsible O
for O
ADMCKD-1 B-Gene
was O
mapped O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
1q21 I-Chromosome
and O
it O
is O
flanked O
proximally O
by O
marker O
D1S498 O
and O
distally O
by O
D1S2125, O
encompassing O
a O
region O
of O
approximately O
8 O
cm. O
Within O
this O
region O
there O
are O
a O
large O
number O
of O
transcribed O
genes O
including O
NPR1 B-Gene
that O
encodes O
the O
atrial B-Gene
natriuretic I-Gene
peptide I-Gene
receptor I-Gene
1. I-Gene
This O
receptor O
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
regulation O
of O
blood O
pressure O
by O
facilitating O
salt B-Chemical
excretion. O
Based O
on O
its O
function O
we O
hypothesized O
this O
gene O
as O
a O
reasonable O
candidate O
for O
the O
MCKD1 B-Gene
locus. O
DNA O
mutation O
screening O
was O
performed O
on O
the O
entire O
NPR1 B-Gene
gene-coding O
sequence O
and O
some O
of O
the O
5' O
prime-UTR O
and O
3'-UTR O
sequences. O
The O
samples O
investigated O
belonged O
to O
patients B-Species
of O
five O
large O
ADMCKD-1 B-Gene
Cypriot O
families. O
The O
screening O
revealed O
two O
novel O
polymorphisms, O
one O
intragenic O
at O
amino O
acid O
position O
939, O
which O
was O
occupied O
by O
either O
arginine O
or O
glutamine, O
and O
a O
second O
one O
located O
in O
the O
3' O
prime-UTR, O
29 O
nucleotides O
downstream O
of O
the O
NPR1 B-Gene
stop O
codon. O
The O
latter O
was O
a O
single O
nucleotide O
C O
insertion O
deletion O
in O
a O
stretch O
of O
three O
or O
four O
Cs. B-Gene
No O
relationship O
was O
present O
between O
any O
allele O
of O
the O
two O
polymorphisms O
and O
the O
disease, O
as O
both O
alleles O
were O
observed O
in O
both O
affected O
and O
healthy O
subjects. O
In O
addition, O
no O
association O
was O
observed O
between O
the O
disease O
and O
another O
rare O
8-bp O
deletion O
polymorphism O
at O
the O
5' O
prime-UTR O
of O
NPR1 B-Gene
and O
the O
disease. O
Based O
on O
these O
findings O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
NPR1 B-Gene
is O
the O
same O
as O
the O
MCKD1 B-Gene
gene, O
although O
it O
is O
presently O
unknown O
whether O
it O
plays O
a O
disease O
modifying O
role. O
