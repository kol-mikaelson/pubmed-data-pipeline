# Abstract
Methylglyoxal, B-Chemical
a O
toxic O
aldehyde, B-Chemical
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
increased O
in O
diabetes B-Disease
and O
has O
been O
claimed O
to O
be O
related O
to O

complications. I-Disease
Aminoacetone, B-Chemical
an O
intermediate O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
threonine B-Chemical
and O
glycine, B-Chemical
has O
been O
proposed O
to O
be O
an O
endogenous O
substrate O
for O
semicarbazide-sensitive B-Gene
amine I-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
(SSAO). B-Gene
Methylglyoxal B-Chemical

An O
HPLC O
procedure O
for O
the O
determination O
of O
SSAO B-Gene

described. O
It O
was O
observed O
in O
previous O
assays O
that O
methylglyoxal B-Chemical
formed O
via O
deamination O
of O
aminoacetone B-Chemical
was O
quite O
unstable O
and O
led O
to O
erroneous O
results. O
o-Phenylenediamine B-Chemical
(o-PD) B-Chemical
was O
therefore O
employed O
for O
derivatization O
of O
methylglyoxal. B-Chemical
o-PD B-Chemical
does O
not O

This O
can O
avoid O
the O

Deamination O
of O
aminoacetone B-Chemical
