# Abstract
An O
overview O
is O
presented O
on O
the O
molecular O
aspects O
of O
toxicity B-Disease
due O
to O
paracetamol B-Chemical
(acetaminophen) B-Chemical
and O
structural O
analogues. O
The O
emphasis O
is O
on O
four O
main O
topics, O
that O
is, O
bioactivation, O
detoxication, O
chemoprevention, O
and O
chemoprotection. O
In O
addition, O
some O
pharmacological O
and O
clinical O
aspects O
are O
discussed O
briefly. O
A O
general O
introduction O
is O
presented O
on O
the O
biokinetics, O
biotransformation, O
and O
structural O
modification O
of O
paracetamol. B-Chemical
Phase O
II O
biotransformation O
in O
relation O
to O
marked O
species O
differences O
and O
interorgan O
transport O
of O
metabolites O
are O
described O
in O
detail, O
as O
are O
bioactivation O
by O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
and O
peroxidases, O
two O
important O
phase O
I O
enzyme O
families. O
Hepatotoxicity B-Disease
is O
described O
in O
depth, O
as O
it O
is O
the O
most O
frequent O
clinical O
observation O
after O
paracetamol-intoxication. O
In O
this O
context, O
covalent O
protein O
binding O
and O
oxidative O
stress O
are O
two O
important O
initial O
(Stage O
I) O
events O
highlighted. O
In O
addition, O
the O
more O
recently O
reported O
nuclear O
effects O
are O
discussed O
as O
well O
as O
secondary O
events O
(Stage O
II) O
that O
spread O
over O
the O
whole O
liver O
and O
may O
be O
relevant O
targets O
for O
clinical O
treatment. O
The O
second O
most O
frequent O
clinical O
observation, O
renal B-Disease
toxicity, I-Disease
is O
described O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
involvement O
of O
prostaglandin O
synthase, O
N-deacetylase, O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
and O
glutathione B-Gene
S-transferase. I-Gene
Lastly, O
mechanism-based O
developments O
of O
chemoprotective O
agents O
and O
progress O
in O
the O
development O
of O
structural O
analogues O
with O
an O
improved O
therapeutic O
index O
are O
outlined. O
