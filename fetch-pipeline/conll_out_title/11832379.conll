Identification O

# Abstract
Facilitative O
glucose O
transporters O
exhibit O
variable O
hexose B-Chemical
affinity O
and O
tissue-specific O
expression. O
These O
characteristics O
contribute O
to O
specialized O
metabolic O
properties O
of O
cells. O
Here O
we O
describe O
the O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
glucose O
transporter-like O
molecule, O
GLUT-12. B-Gene
GLUT-12 B-Gene
was O
identified O
in O
MCF-7 B-CellLine
breast I-CellLine
cancer I-CellLine
cells O
by O
homology O
to O
the O
insulin-regulatable O
glucose O
transporter O
GLUT-4. B-Gene
The O
GLUT-12 B-Gene
cDNA O
encodes O
617 O
amino O
acids, O
which O
possess O
features O
essential O
for O
sugar O
transport. O
Di-leucine O
motifs O
are O
present O
in O
NH(2) O
and O
COOH O
termini O
at O
positions O
similar O
to O
the O
GLUT-4 B-Gene
FQQI O
and O
LL O
targeting O
motifs. O
GLUT-12 B-Gene
exhibits O
29% O
amino O
acid O
identity O
with O
GLUT-4 B-Gene
and O
40% O
to O
the O
recently O
described O
GLUT-10. B-Gene
Like O
GLUT-10, B-Gene
a O
large O
extracellular O
domain O
is O
predicted O
between O
transmembrane O
domains O
9 O
and O
10. O
Genomic O
organization O
of O
GLUT-12 B-Gene
is O
highly O
conserved O
with O
GLUT-10 B-Gene
but O
distinct O
from O
GLUTs B-Gene
1-5. I-Gene
Immunofluorescence O
showed O
that, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
insulin, B-Gene
GLUT-12 B-Gene
is O
localized O
to O
the O
perinuclear O
region O
in O
MCF-7 B-CellLine
cells. O
Immunoblotting O
demonstrated O
GLUT-12 B-Gene
expression O
in O
skeletal O
muscle, O
adipose O
tissue, O
and O
small O
intestine. O
Thus O
GLUT-12 B-Gene
is O
potentially O
part O
of O
a O
second O
insulin-responsive O
glucose O
transport O
system. O
