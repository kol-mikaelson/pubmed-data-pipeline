# Abstract
In O
liver O
and O
intestine, O
transporters O
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
maintaining O
the O
enterohepatic O
circulation O
and O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
homeostasis. O
Over O
the O
past O
two O
decades, O
there O
has O
been O
significant O
progress O
toward O
identifying O
the O
individual O
membrane O
transporters O
and O
unraveling O
their O
complex O
regulation. O
In O
the O
liver, O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
efficiently O
transported O
across O
the O
sinusoidal O
membrane O
by O
the O
Na(+) O
taurocholate O
cotransporting O
polypeptide O
with O
assistance O
by O
members O
of O
the O
organic O
anion B-Chemical
transporting O
polypeptide O
family. O
The O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
then O
secreted O
in O
an O
ATP-dependent O
fashion O
across O
the O
canalicular O
membrane O
by O
the O
bile O
salt O
export O
pump. O
Following O
their O
movement O
with O
bile O
into O
the O
lumen O
of O
the O
small O
intestine, O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
almost O
quantitatively O
reclaimed O
in O
the O
ileum O
by O
the O
apical O
sodium-dependent O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporter. O
The O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
shuttled O
across O
the O
enterocyte O
to O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
and O
effluxed O
into O
the O
portal O
circulation O
by O
the O
recently O
indentified O
heteromeric O
organic O
solute O
transporter, O
OSTalpha-OSTbeta. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
hepatocyte O
and O
enterocyte, O
subgroups O
of O
these O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporters O
are O
expressed O
by O
the O
biliary, O
renal, O
and O
colonic O
epithelium O
where O
they O
contribute O
to O
maintaining O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
homeostasis O
and O
play O
important O
cytoprotective O
roles. O
This O
article O
will O
review O
our O
current O
understanding O
of O
the O
physiological O
role O
and O
regulation O
of O
these O
important O
carriers. O
