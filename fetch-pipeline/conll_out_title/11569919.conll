# Abstract
Aldehyde B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
(AO) O
is O
a O
molybdo-flavo O
enzyme O
expressed O
predominantly O
in O
the O
liver, O
lung, O
and O
kidney. O
AO O
plays O
a O
major O
role O
in O
oxidation O
of O
aldehydes, B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
oxidation O
of O
various O
N-heterocyclic B-Chemical
compounds I-Chemical
of O
pharmacological O
and O
toxicological O
importance O
including O
antiviral O
(famciclovir), B-Chemical
antimalarial O
(quinine), B-Chemical
antitumour O
(methotrexate), B-Chemical
and O
nicotine. B-Chemical
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
cytosolic O
aldehyde B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
activity O
in O
human B-Species
liver. O
Cytosolic O
AO O
was O
characterised O
using O
both O
the O
metabolism O
of O
N-[(2-dimethylamino)ethyl] B-Chemical
acridine-4-carboxamide I-Chemical
(DACA) B-Chemical
and O
benzaldehyde B-Chemical
to O
form O
DACA-9(10H)-acridone B-Chemical
(quantified O
by O
HPLC O
with O
fluorescence O
detection) O
and O
benzoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(quantified O
spectrophotometrically). O
Thirteen O
livers O
(10 O
female, O
3 O
male) O
were O
examined. O
The O
intrinsic O
clearance O
(Vmax O
Km) O
of O
DACA B-Chemical
varied O
18-fold O
(0.03-0.50 O
m O
min O
mg). O
Vmax O
ranged O
from O
0.20-3.10 O
nmol O
min O
mg, O
and O
Km O
ranged O
from O
3.5-14.2 O
microM. O
In O
the O
same O
specimens, O
the O
intrinsic O
clearance O
for O
benzaldehyde B-Chemical
varied O
5-fold O
(0.40-1.8 O
ml O
min O
mg). O
Vmax O
ranged O
from O
3.60-12.6 O
nmol O
min O
mg O
and O
Km O
ranged O
from O
3.6-14.6 O
microM. O
Furthermore, O
there O
were O
no O
differences O
in O
AO O
activity O
between O
male O
and O
female O
human B-Species
livers, O
nor O
was O
there O
any O
relationship O
to O
age O
of O
donor O
(range O
29-73 O
years), O
smoking O
status, O
or O
disease O
status. O
In O
conclusion, O
our O
results O
showed O
that O
there O
are O
variations O
in O
AO O
activity O
in O
human B-Species
liver. O
These O
variations O
in O
aldehyde B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
activity O
might O
reflect O
individual O
variations O
or O
they O
might O
be O
due O
to O
AO O
stability O
during O
processing O
and O
storage. O
