# Abstract
Very-long-chain O
acyl-CoA O
synthetases O
(VLCS) B-Gene
activate O
very-long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(VLCFA) B-Chemical
containing O
22 O
or O
more O
carbons B-Chemical
to O
their O
CoA B-Chemical
derivatives. O
We O
cloned O
the O
human B-Species
ortholog O
(hVLCS) O
of O
the O
gene O
encoding O
the O
rat B-Species
liver O
enzyme O
(rVLCS). O
Both O
hVLCS O
and O
rVLCS O
contain O
620 O
amino O
acids, O
are O
expressed O
primarily O
in O
liver O
and O
kidney, O
and O
have O
a O
potential O
peroxisome O
targeting O
signal O
1 O
(-LKL) O
at O
their O
carboxy O
termini. O
When O
expressed O
in O
COS-1 B-CellLine
cells, O
hVLCS O

acid. I-Chemical
Immunofluorescence O
and O
immunoblot O
studies O
localized O
hVLCS O
to O
both O
peroxisomes O
and O
endoplasmic O
reticulum. O
In O
peroxisomes O
of O
HepG2 B-CellLine
cells, O
hVLCS O
was O
topographically O
oriented O
facing O
the O
matrix O
and O
not O
the O
cytoplasm. O
This O
orientation, O
coupled O
with O
the O
observation O
that O
hVLCS O
activates O
branched-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
suggests O
that O
hVLCS O
could O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
intraperoxisomal O
reactivation O
of O
pristanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
produced O
via O
alpha-oxidation O
of O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
