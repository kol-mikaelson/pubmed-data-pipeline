# Abstract
Transport O
of O
nonesterified B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(NEFA) B-Chemical
is O
an O
important O
component O
of O
whole-body O
energy O
metabolism, O
and O
derangements O
in O
NEFA B-Chemical
transport O
have O
been O
linked O
to O
several O
diseases. O
NEFA B-Chemical
are O
transferred O
from O
their O
sites O
of O
production O
to O
cells O
in O
hepatic O
and O
peripheral O
tissues O
by O
mechanisms O
that O
are O
regulated O
in O
part O
by O
cell O
status O
and O
as O
determined O
by O
the O
covalent O
structure O
of O
the O
NEFA B-Chemical
species. O
Major O
barriers O
to O
physical O
transport O
are O
transfer O
from O
the O
hydrophobic O
surfaces O
on O
cell O
membranes O
and O
NEFA-binding O
proteins, O
such O
as O
albumin, B-Gene
into O
the O
surrounding O
aqueous O
phase O
and O
translocation O
across O
a O
membrane O
that O
contains O
a O
very O
hydrophobic O
interior; O
this O
process O
could O
be O
purely O
diffusive O
or O
require O
specific O
protein O
cofactors. O
Herein O
evidence O
is O
provided O
suggesting O
that O
this O
step O
is O
driven O
by O
intracellular O
metabolism O
that O
supports O
a O
NEFA B-Chemical
gradient O
across O
the O
cell O
membrane. O
According O
to O
current O
models O
of O
NEFA B-Chemical
transfer, O
the O
rate-limiting O
step O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
desorption O
of O
NEFA B-Chemical
from O
the O
inner O
leaflet O
of O
the O
cell O
membrane O
or O
intracellular O
metabolism; O
for O
very O
long O
chain O
NEFA, B-Chemical
the O
former O
is O
more O
likely. O
