# Abstract
Thromboxane B-Chemical
A2 I-Chemical
synthase O
(TXAS) B-Gene
is O
a O
member O
of O
the O
cytochrome O
P450 O
superfamily O
and O
catalyzes O
an O
isomerization O
reaction O
that O
converts O
prostaglandin B-Chemical
H2 I-Chemical
to O
thromboxane B-Chemical
A2. I-Chemical
As O
a O
step O
toward O
understanding O
the O
structure O
function O
relationships O
of O
TXAS, B-Gene
we O
mutated O
amino O
acid O
residues O
predicted O
to O
bind O
the O
propionate B-Chemical
groups O
of O
A- O
and O
D-pyrrole O
rings O
of O
the O
heme. B-Chemical
These O
mutations O
at O
each O
of O
these O
residues O
(Asn-110, O
Trp-133, O
Arg-137, O
Arg-413, O
and O
Arg-478) O
resulted O
in O
altered O
heme B-Chemical
binding, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
perturbation O
of O
the O

and O
EPR. O
The O
mutations, O
although O

that O

and O
alteration O
of O

Moreover, O
these O
mutant O
proteins O
lost O
their O
binding O
affinity O
to O
the O
substrate O
analog, O
had O
a O
lower O
heme B-Chemical
content O
and O
retained O
less O
than O
5% O
of O
the O
wild-type O
catalytic O
activity. O
However, O
mutations O
at O
the O
neighboring O
amino O

of O
the O

residues O
yielded O
mutant O

TXAS. B-Gene
Aligning O
the O
TXAS B-Gene
sequence O
with O
the O
structurally O
known O
P450s, O
we O
proposed O
that O
in O
TXAS B-Gene
the O
A-ring O
propionate B-Chemical
of O
the O
heme B-Chemical
is O
hydrogen B-Chemical
bonded O
to O
Asn-110, O

and O
Arg-478, O
whereas O
D-ring O
propionate B-Chemical
is O
hydrogen B-Chemical
bonded O
to O

and O
Arg-137. O
Furthermore, O
both O

from O
the O
heme B-Chemical
plane O
and O
both O

on O
the O
