# Abstract
Pharmacogenetic O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
several O
cytochrome O
P450 O
(CYP) O
enzymes O
exhibit O
genetic O
polymorphisms. O
Several O
benzodiazepines B-Chemical
(BZPs) B-Chemical
are O
metabolized O
predominantly O
or O
partly O
by O
polymorphic O
CYP2C19 B-Gene
and O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
5. I-Gene
The O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
diazepam, B-Chemical
etizolam, B-Chemical
quazepam B-Chemical
and O
desmethylclobazam B-Chemical
have O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
affected O
by O
CYP2C19 B-Gene
polymorphism. O
The O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
polymorphism O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
affect O
the O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
alprazolam, B-Chemical
but O
its O
effect O
on O
midazolam B-Chemical
kinetics O
has O
been O
inconclusive. O
For O
etizolam B-Chemical
and O
desmethylclobazam, B-Chemical
some O
data O
suggest O
that O
CYP2C19 B-Gene
deficiency O
leads O
to O
side-effects O
or O
toxicity. B-Disease
For O
the O
remaining O
BZPs B-Chemical
the O
clinical O
significance O
of O
the O
observed O
pharmacokinetic O
changes O
remains O
unclear. O
Further O

the O
effects O
of O
genetic O
polymorphisms O
of O
CYP O
enzymes O
on O
the O
pharmacokinetics O

pharmacodynamics O
