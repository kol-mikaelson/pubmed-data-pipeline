The O
importance O

has O
been O
increasingly O
recognized O
during O
the O
last O
decade. O
Organic B-Gene
anion I-Gene
transporting I-Gene
polypeptide I-Gene
1B1 I-Gene
(OATP1B1) B-Gene
is O
a O
genetically O
polymorphic O
influx O
transporter O
expressed O
on O
the O
sinusoidal O
membrane O
of O
human B-Species
hepatocytes, O
and O
it O
mediates O
the O
hepatic O
uptake O
of O
many O
endogenous O
compounds O
and O
xenobiotics. O
Recent O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
OATP1B1 B-Gene
plays O
a O
major, O
clinically O
important O
role O
in O
the O
hepatic O
uptake O
of O
many O
drugs. O
A O

However, O
the O

the O
SLCO1B1 B-Gene

The O

also O
markedly O

the O

Furthermore, O
certain O

Certain O
drugs O
(e.g., O
cyclosporine) B-Chemical
potently O
inhibit O
OATP1B1, B-Gene

Thus, O
OATP1B1 B-Gene
plays O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
hepatic O
uptake O
of O
drugs, O
and O
genetic O
variants O
and O
drug O
interactions O

OATP1B1 B-Gene

are O
important O
