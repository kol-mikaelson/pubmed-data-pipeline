# Abstract
In O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae, I-Species
the O
genes O
ODC1 B-Gene
and O
ODC2 B-Gene
encode O
isoforms O
of O
the O
oxodicarboxylate B-Gene
carrier. I-Gene
They O
both O
transport O
C5-C7 B-Chemical
oxodicarboxylates B-Chemical
across O
the O
inner O
membranes O
of O
mitochondria O
and O
are O
members O
of O
the O
family O
of O
mitochondrial O
carrier O
proteins. O
Orthologs O
are O
encoded O
in O
the O
genomes O
of O
Caenorhabditis B-Species
elegans I-Species
and O
Drosophila B-Species
melanogaster, I-Species
and O
a O
human B-Species
expressed O
sequence O
tag O
(EST) O
encodes O
part O
of O
a O
closely O
related O
protein. O
Information O
from O
the O
EST O
has O
been O
used O
to O
complete O
the O
human B-Species
cDNA O
sequence. O
This O
sequence O
has O
been O
used O
to O
map O
the O
gene O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
14q11.2 I-Chromosome
and O
to O
show O
that O
the O
gene O
is O
expressed O
in O
all O
tissues O
that O
were O
examined. O
The O
human B-Species
protein O
was O
produced O
by O
overexpression O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli, I-Species
purified, O
and O
reconstituted O
into O
phospholipid B-Chemical
vesicles. O
It O
has O
similar O
transport O
characteristics O
to O
the O
yeast B-Species
oxodicarboxylate B-Gene
carrier I-Gene
proteins O
(ODCs). O
Both O
the O
human B-Species
and O

the O
transport O
of O
the O
oxodicarboxylates B-Chemical
2-oxoadipate B-Chemical
and O
2-oxoglutarate B-Chemical
by O
a O
counter-exchange O
mechanism. O

extent, O
pimelate, B-Chemical
2-oxopimelate, B-Chemical
2-aminoadipate, B-Chemical
oxaloacetate, B-Chemical
and O
citrate B-Chemical
were O

the O
human B-Species
ODC. B-Gene
The O
main O
differences O
between O
the O
human B-Species
and O
yeast B-Species
ODCs O
are O
that O
2-aminoadipate B-Chemical
is O
transported O
by O
the O
former O
but O
not O
by O
the O
latter, O
whereas O
malate B-Chemical
is O
transported O
by O
the O
yeast B-Species
ODCs O
but O
not O
by O
the O
human B-Species
ortholog. O
In O
mammals, O
2-oxoadipate B-Chemical
is O
a O
common O
intermediate O
in O
the O
catabolism O
of O
lysine, B-Chemical
tryptophan, B-Chemical
and O
hydroxylysine. B-Chemical
It O
is O
transported O
from O
the O
cytoplasm O
into O
mitochondria O
where O
it O
is O
converted O
into O
acetyl-CoA. B-Chemical
Defects O
in O
human B-Species
