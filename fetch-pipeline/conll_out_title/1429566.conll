# Abstract
2-Keto-3-methylvaleric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(KMVA) B-Chemical
has O
been O
found O
not O
to O
undergo O
spontaneous O
keto-enol O
tautomerization O
in O
neutral O
aqueous O
solution, O
alone O
or O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
large O
concentrations O
of O
pyridoxamine B-Chemical
or O
pyridoxamine-5-phosphate. B-Chemical
This O
finding O
denies O
the O
commonly O
held O
suppositions O
that O
3R-KMVA O
is O
derived O
spontaneously O
from O
3S-KMVA O
in O
vivo, O
and O
that O
L-alloisoleucine B-Chemical
is O
the O
product O
of O
the O
reamination O
of O
this O
3R-KMVA. O
Evidence O
presented O
here O
suggests O
that O
racemization O
of O
the O
3-carbon O
of O
L-isoleucine B-Chemical
occurs O
during O
transamination, O
that O
L-alloisoleucine B-Chemical
is O
an O
inherently O
unavoidable O
by-product O
of O
L-isoleucine B-Chemical
transamination O
(and O
vice O
versa), O
and O
that O
a O
KMVA B-Chemical
enol O
is O
not O
obligate O
in O
this O
racemization. O
The O
four O
stereoisomers O
of O
2-hydroxy-3-methylvaleric B-Chemical

An O

The O
