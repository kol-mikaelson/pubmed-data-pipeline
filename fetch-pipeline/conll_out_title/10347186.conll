# Abstract
The O
hyperthermophiles O
Pyrococcus B-Species
furiosus I-Species
and O
Pyrococcus B-Species
abyssi I-Species
make O
pyrimidines B-Chemical
and O
arginine B-Chemical
from O
carbamoyl B-Chemical
phosphate I-Chemical
(CP) O
synthesized O
by O
an O
enzyme O
that O
differs O
from O
other O
carbamoyl-phosphate O
synthetases O
and O
that O
resembles O
carbamate B-Chemical
kinase O
(CK) O
in O
polypeptide O
mass, O
amino O
acid O
sequence, O
and O
oligomeric O
organization. O
This O
enzyme O
was O
reported O
to O
use O
ammonia, B-Chemical
bicarbonate, B-Chemical
and O
two O
ATP B-Chemical
molecules O
as O
carbamoyl-phosphate O
synthetases O
to O
make O
CP O
and O
to O
exhibit O
bicarbonatedependent B-Chemical
ATPase O
activity. O
We O
have O
reexamined O
these O
findings O
using O
the O
enzyme O
of O
P. B-Species
furiosus I-Species
expressed O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
from O
the O
corresponding O
gene O
cloned O
in O
a O
plasmid. O
We O
show O
that O
the O
enzyme O
uses O
chemically O
made O
carbamate B-Chemical
rather O
than O
ammonia B-Chemical
and O
bicarbonate B-Chemical
and O
catalyzes O
a O
reaction O
with O
the O
stoichiometry O
and O
equilibrium O
that O
are O
typical O
for O
CK. O
Furthermore, O
the O
enzyme O
catalyzes O
actively O
full O
reversion O
of O
the O
CK O
reaction O
and O
exhibits O
little O
bicarbonate-dependent B-Chemical
ATPase. O
In O
addition, O
it O
cross-reacts O
with O
antibodies O
raised O
against O
CK O
from O
Enterococcus B-Species
faecium, I-Species
and O
its O
three-dimensional O
structure, O
judged O
by O
x-ray O
crystallography O
of O
enzyme O
crystals, O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
CK. O
Thus, O
the O
enzyme O
is, O
in O
all O
respects O
other O
than O
its O
function O
in O
vivo, O
a O
CK. O
Because O
in O
other O
organisms O
the O
function O
of O
CK O
is O
to O
make O
ATP B-Chemical
from O
ADP B-Chemical
and O
CP O
derived O
from O
arginine B-Chemical
catabolism, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
example O
of O
using O
CK O
for O
making O
rather O
than O
using O
CP. O
The O
reasons O
for O
this O
use O
and O
the O
adaptation O
of O
the O
enzyme O
to O
this O
new O
function O
are O
discussed. O
