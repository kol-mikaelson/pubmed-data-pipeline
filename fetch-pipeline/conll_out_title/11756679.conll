# Abstract
We O
present O
the O
first O
three-dimensional O
reconstruction O
of O
human B-Species
fatty B-Gene
acid I-Gene
synthase I-Gene
obtained O
by O
electron O
cryomicroscopy O
and O
single-particle O
image O
processing. O
The O
structure O
shows O
that O
the O
synthase O
is O
composed O
of O
two O
monomers, O
arranged O
in O
an O
antiparallel O
orientation, O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
biochemical O
data. O
The O
monomers O
are O
connected O
to O
each O
other O
at O
their O
middle O
by O
a O
bridge O
of O
density, O
a O
site O
proposed O
to O
be O
the O
combination O
of O
the O
interdomain O
regions O
of O
the O
two O
monomers. O
Each O
monomer O
subunit O
appears O
to O
be O
subdivided O
into O
three O
structural O
domains. O
With O
this O
reconstruction O
of O
the O
synthase, O
we O
propose O
a O
location O
for O
the O
enzyme's O
two O
fatty O
acid O
synthesis O
sites. O
