# Abstract
Dietary O
phytosterols B-Chemical
are O
cholesterol-lowering O
agents O
that O
interfere O
with O
the O
intestinal O
absorption O
of O
cholesterol. B-Chemical
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
have O
studied O
their O
effects O
on O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
in O
human B-Species
cells, O
particularly O
in O
the O
sterol-conversion O
pathway. O
For O
this, O
both O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
(intestinal O
mucosa) O
and O
HL-60 B-CellLine
(promyelocytic) O
human B-Species
cell O
lines O
were O
incubated O
with O
[(14)C]acetate, B-Chemical
and O
the O
incorporation O
of O
radioactivity O
into O
sterols B-Chemical
was O
determined O
using O
HPLC O
and O
radioactivity O
detection O
online. O
Sterols B-Chemical
containing O
a O
double O
bond O
at O
C-22 O
in O
the O
side O
chain O
(stigmasterol, B-Chemical
brassicasterol B-Chemical
and O
ergosterol) B-Chemical
dramatically O
inhibited O
the O
activity O
of O
sterol B-Chemical
Delta(24)-reductase, I-Chemical
as O
indicated O
by O
the O
decrease O
in O
radioactivity O
incorporation O
into O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
the O
accumulation O
of O
its O
precursors O
(mainly O
desmosterol). B-Chemical
Phytosterols B-Chemical
with O
the O
saturated O
side O
chain O
(beta-sitosterol B-Chemical
and O
campesterol) B-Chemical
were O
inactive O
in O
this O
regard. O
The O
inhibition O
of O
sterol B-Chemical
(24)-reductase O
was O
confirmed O
in O
rat B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
by O
using O
(14)C-labelled O
desmosterol B-Chemical
as O
the O
substrate. O
The O
(22)-unsaturated B-Chemical
phytosterols B-Chemical
acted O
as O
competitive O
inhibitors O
of O
sterol B-Chemical
(24)-reductase, O
with O
K(i) O
values O
(41.1, O
42.7 O
and O
36.8 O
microM O
for O
stigmasterol, B-Chemical
brassicasterol B-Chemical
and O
ergosterol B-Chemical
respectively) O
similar O
to O
the O
estimated O
K(m) O
for O
desmosterol B-Chemical
(26.3 O
microM). O
The O
sterol B-Chemical
5,22-cholestedien-3beta-ol, B-Chemical
an O
unusual O
desmosterol B-Chemical
isomer O
that O
lacks O
the O
alkyl O
groups O
characteristic O
of O
phytosterols, B-Chemical
acted O
as O
a O
much O
stronger O
inhibitor O
of O
(24)-reductase O
(K(i)=3.34 O
microM). O
The O
usually O
low O
intracellular O
concentrations O
of O
the O
physiological O
substrates O
of O
(24)-reductase O
explains O
the O
strong O
inhibition O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
that O
these O
compounds O
exert O
in O
cells. O
Given O
that O
inhibition O
of O
sterol B-Chemical
(24)-reductase O
was O
achieved O
at O
physiologically O
relevant O
concentrations, O
it O
may O
represent O
an O
additional O
mechanism O
for O
the O
cholesterol-lowering O
action O
of O
phytosterols, B-Chemical
and O
opens O
up O
the O
possibility O
of O
using O
certain O
(22)-unsaturated B-Chemical
sterols I-Chemical
as O
effective O
hypocholesterolaemic O
agents. O
