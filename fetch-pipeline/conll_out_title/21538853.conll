# Abstract
SCOPE: O
Hydroxycinnamic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
abundant O
antioxidants O
in O
our O
diet. O
In O
humans, B-Species
hydroxycinnamic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
metabolized O
to O
form O
sulfates B-Chemical
and O
glucuronides, B-Chemical
with O
the O
majority O
recovered O
in O
urine. O
METHODS O
AND O
RESULTS: O
We O
assessed O
the O
potential O
roles O
of O
organic O
anion O
transporters O
(OATs) O
and O
ATP-binding O
cassette O
(ABC) O
transporters O
in O
the O
renal O
uptake O
and O
efflux O
of O
hydroxycinnamic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
conjugates. O
Uptake O
studies O
using O
OAT1 B-Gene
(SLC22A6)-, B-Gene
OAT2 B-Gene
(SLC22A7)-, B-Gene
and O
OAT3 B-Gene
(SLC22A8)-expressing O
293H B-CellLine

showed O
that O
OAT1 B-Gene
and O
OAT3, B-Gene
but O
not O
OAT2, B-Gene
accepted O
hydroxycinnamic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
conjugates O
as O
substrates. O
OAT1 B-Gene
and O
OAT3 B-Gene
mediated O
the O
basolateral O
uptake O
of O
hydroxycinnamic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
sulfates I-Chemical
and O
glucuronide B-Chemical
conjugates, O
respectively. O
Hydroxycinnamic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
sulfates I-Chemical
are O
substrates O
of O
OAT4 B-Gene
and O
were O
capable O
of O
trans-stimulating O

by O
OAT4. B-Gene
On O
the O

by O
the O
inability O
to O

ATPase B-Gene
activity. O
Cis-inhibition O
studies O
with O
OATs O
and O
MRPs B-Gene
revealed O
that O
hydroxycinnamic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
conjugates O
have O
limited O

on O
the O

significantly O
at O
physiological O
concentrations. O
CONCLUSION: O
Concerted O
action O
of O
OAT1, B-Gene
OAT3, B-Gene
and O
OAT4 B-Gene
is O
involved O
in O
the O
elimination O
of O
hydroxycinnamic B-Chemical

into O
urine, O
whereas O
MRP2 B-Gene
and O
breast B-Disease

protein I-Disease
are O
not O
involved O
in O
the O
disposition O
of O
