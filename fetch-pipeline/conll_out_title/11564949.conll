# Abstract
Polyamines B-Chemical
arrive O
in O
the O
gut O
lumen O
mainly O
with O
food. O
Shortly O
after O
a O
meal, O
the O
majority O
of O
luminal B-Chemical
polyamines I-Chemical
disappear O
from O
the O
duodenal O
and O
jejunal O
lumen, O
by O
a O
mechanism O
of O
passive O
diffusion. O
The O
majority O
of O
luminal B-Chemical
polyamines I-Chemical
are O
degraded O
in O
the O
gut O
before O
reaching O
systemic O
circulation. O
Hence, O
there O
is O
broad O
evidence O
that O
luminal B-Chemical
polyamines I-Chemical
are O
indeed O
absorbed, O
distributed O
throughout O
the O
body, O
and O
utilized O
for O
cellular O
growth O
in O
remote O
organs O
and O
tissues. O
In O
addition, O
luminal B-Chemical
polyamines I-Chemical
are O
crucially O
involved O
in O
normal, O
adaptive O
and O
neoplastic O
growth O
of O
the O
gut O
per O
se, O
and O
are O
taken O
up O
by O
normal O
and O
neoplastic O
epithelial O
cells O
of O
the O
gut O
mucosa O
by O
a O
tightly O
regulated O
and O
presumably O
active O
transport O
process. O
Uptake O
of O
polyamines B-Chemical
into O
intestinal O
and O
colonic O
epithelial O
cells O
is O
the O
highest O
during O
cell O
proliferation, O
and O
is O
stimulated O
by O
mitogens O
and O
peptide O
growth O
factors. O
Understanding O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
polyamine B-Chemical
uptake O
in O
neoplastic O
cells O
of O
the O
gut, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
"biodistribution O
bioavailability" O
of O
luminal B-Chemical
polyamines I-Chemical
in O
man, O
may O
provide O
clinically O
relevant O
information O
that O
can O
be O
used O
in O
inhibiting O
cancer O
cell O
growth O
by O
deprivation O
of O
intracellular O
polyamine B-Chemical
pools. O
