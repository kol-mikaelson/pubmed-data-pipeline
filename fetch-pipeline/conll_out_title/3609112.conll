Factors O

nifedipine. B-Chemical

# Abstract
The O
plasma O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
nifedipine B-Chemical
and O
the O
formation O
of O
its O
metabolites O
have O
been O
studied O
in O
volunteers O
under O
conditions O
which O
would O
affect O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
cytochrome B-Gene
P-450 I-Gene
system. O
The O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
a O
10-mg O
capsule O
of O
nifedipine B-Chemical
were O
not O
significantly O
different O
between O
smokers O
and O
non-smokers O
of O
similar O
age. O
After O
pretreatment O
with O
cimetidine, B-Chemical
which O
inhibits O
the O
activity O
of O
cytochrome B-Gene
P-450, I-Gene
the O
peak O
plasma O
concentration O
and O
area O
under O
the O
plasma-time O
concentration O
curve O
for O
nifedipine B-Chemical
were O
increased O
by O
a O
mean O
84%. O
In O
contrast, O
pre-treatment O
with O
ranitidine B-Chemical
which O
has O
little O
effect O
on O
cytochrome B-Gene
P-450, I-Gene
did O
not O
significantly O
alter O
nifedipine B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics. O
Smoking O
does O
not O
contribute O
significantly O
to O
the O
variability O
in O
nifedipine B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics. O
However, O
the O
interaction O
between O
nifedipine B-Chemical
and O
cimetidine, B-Chemical
but O
not O
ranitidine, B-Chemical
may O
be O
of O
clinical O
importance. O
