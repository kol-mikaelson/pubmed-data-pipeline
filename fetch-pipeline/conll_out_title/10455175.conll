# Abstract
Mammalian O
secretory O
phospholipase O
A(2)s O
(sPLA(2)s) O
are O
classified O
into O
several O
groups O
according O
to O
molecular O
structure O
and O
the O
localization O
of O
intramolecular O
disulfide B-Chemical
bridges. O
Among O
them, O
group O
IIA B-Gene
sPLA(2) B-Gene
has O
been O
thought O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
key O
enzymes O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
inflammatory B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
owing O
to O
its O
augmented O
expression O
under O
various O
inflammatory B-Disease
conditions. O
However, O
in O
a O
number O
of O
inbred O
mouse B-Species
strains, O
the O
group O
IIA B-Gene
sPLA(2) B-Gene
gene O
is O
naturally O
disrupted O
by O
a O
frameshift O
mutation. O
Here, O
we O
report O
the O
cloning O
of O
a O
cDNA O
encoding O
a O
novel O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
expressed O
in O
the O
spleen O
of O
group B-Disease
IIA I-Disease
sPLA(2)-deficient I-Disease
mouse. B-Species
We O
also O
cloned O
its O
human B-Species
homolog O
and O
mapped O
its O
gene O
location O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
1p36.12 I-Chromosome
near O
the O
loci O
of O
group O
IIA B-Gene
and O
V O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
genes. O
The O
human B-Species
mature O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
protein O
consists O
of O
125 O
amino O
acids O
(M(r) O

14,500) O
preceded O
by O
a O
20-residue O
prepeptide O
and O
is O
most O
similar O
to O
group O
IIA B-Gene
sPLA(2) B-Gene
with O
respect O
to O
the O
number O
and O
positions O
of O
cysteine O
residues O
as O
well O
as O
overall O
identity O
(48%). O
Based O
on O
these O
structural O
properties, O
the O
novel O
sPLA(2) B-Gene
should O
be O
categorized O
into O
group O
II, O
called O
group O
IID O
to O
follow O
the O
already O
identified O
IIA B-Gene

When O
the O
cDNA O
was O
expressed O
in O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells, O
PLA(2) B-Gene
activity O
preferentially O
accumulated O
in O
the O

medium. O

is O

In O
assays O
with O
individual O
substrates, O
L-alpha-1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl B-Chemical
phosphatidylethanolamine I-Chemical

the O
other O

An O

exhibited O
two O

(2.0 O

thymus, O
and O

The O
