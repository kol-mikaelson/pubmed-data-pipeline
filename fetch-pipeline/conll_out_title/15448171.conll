# Abstract
Breast B-Gene
cancer I-Gene
resistance I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(Bcrp B-Gene
Abcg2) B-Gene
is O
a O
new O
efflux O
transporter O
found O
at O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
(BBB) O
of O
humans B-Species
and O
pigs. B-Species
Since O
it O
has O
been O
hypothesized O
that O
Bcrp B-Gene
may O
act O
as O
a O
new O
type O
of O
efflux O
transporter O
at O
the O
BBB, O
we O
investigated O
the O
involvement O
of O
Bcrp B-Gene
in O
the O
efflux O
transport O
of O
typical O
substrates, O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
(DHEAS) B-Chemical
and O
mitoxantrone, B-Chemical
across O
the O
mouse B-Species
BBB. O
The O
expression O
of O
Bcrp B-Gene
in O
mouse B-Species
brain O
capillaries O
was O
confirmed O
by O
quantitative O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction, O
Western O
blot, O
and O
immunohistochemical O
analysis. O
The O
role O
of O
Bcrp B-Gene
as O
an O
efflux O
transporter O
was O
evaluated O
using O
the O
in O
situ O
brain O
perfusion O
method O
in O
wild-type O
and O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
(P-gp) B-Gene
knockout O
mice B-Species
with O
or O
without O
treatment O
with O
GF120918 B-Chemical
(Elacridar), B-Chemical
an O
inhibitor O
of O
both O
Bcrp B-Gene
and O
P-gp. B-Gene
The O
increased O
brain O
uptake O
of O
[(3)H]DHEAS B-Chemical
and O
[(3)H]mitoxantrone B-Chemical
by O
GF120918 B-Chemical
in O
wild-type O
and O
P-gp B-Gene
knockout O
mice B-Species
suggested O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
GF120918-sensitive O
and O
P-gp-independent O
efflux O
transporter O
for O
DHEAS B-Chemical
and O
mitoxantrone B-Chemical
across O
the O
BBB. O
However, O
the O
brain O
uptake O
of O
[(3)H]DHEAS B-Chemical
in O
Bcrp B-Gene
knockout O
mice B-Species
was O
comparable O
with O
that O
in O
wild-type O
mice, B-Species
and O
the O
effect O
of O
GF120918 B-Chemical
was O
still O
observed O
in O
Bcrp B-Gene
knockout O
mice. B-Species
In O
addition, O
the O
brain O
uptake O
of O
[(3)H]mitoxantrone B-Chemical
was O
also O
similar O
in O
wild-type O
and O
Bcrp B-Gene
knockout O
mice. B-Species
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
although O
BCRP B-Gene
is O
expressed O
at O
the O
BBB O
it O
plays O
a O
minor O
role O
in O
active O
efflux O
transport O
of O
DHEAS B-Chemical
and O
mitoxantrone B-Chemical
out O
of O
brain O
and O
that O
one O
or O
more O
GF120918-sensitive O
efflux O
transporters O
distinct O
from O
BCRP B-Gene
or O
P-gp B-Gene
contributes O
to O
the O
brain O
efflux O
of O
DHEAS B-Chemical
and O
mitoxantrone. B-Chemical
