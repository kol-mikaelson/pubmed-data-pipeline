# Abstract
Glutaric B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
type I-Disease
1 I-Disease
(GA1) B-Disease
is O
caused O
by O
the O
deficiency B-Disease
of I-Disease
glutaryl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
(GCDH). B-Gene
Affected O
patients B-Species
are O
prone O
to O
the O
development O
of O
encephalopathic B-Disease
crises I-Disease
during O
an O
early O
time O
window O
with O
destruction O
of O
striatal O
neurons O
and O
a O
subsequent O
irreversible O
movement B-Disease
disorder. I-Disease
3-Hydroxyglutaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(3OHGA) B-Chemical
accumulates O
in O
tissues O
and O
body O
fluids O
of O
GA1 B-Disease
patients B-Species
and O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
mediate O
toxic O
effects O
on O
neuronal O
as O
well O
as O
endothelial O
cells. O
Injection O
of O
(3H)-labeled O
into O
6 O
week-old O
Gcdh(- B-Gene
-) O
mice, B-Species
a O
model O
of O
GA1, B-Disease
revealed O
a O
low O
recovery O
in O
kidney, O
liver, O
or O
brain O
tissue O
that O
did O
not O
differ O
from O
control O
mice. B-Species
Significant O
amounts O
of O
3OHGA B-Chemical
were O
found O
to O
be O
excreted O
via O
the O
intestinal O
tract. O
Exposure O
of O
Gcdh(- B-Gene
-) O
mice B-Species
to O
a O
high O
protein O
diet O
led O
to O
an O
encephalopathic B-Disease
crisis, I-Disease
vacuolization O
in O
the O
brain, O
and O
death B-Disease
after O
4-5 O
days. O
Under O
these O
conditions, O
high O
amounts O
of O
injected O
3H-3OHGA B-Chemical
were O
found O
in O
kidneys O
of O
Gcdh(- B-Gene
-) O
mice, B-Species
whereas O
the O
radioactivity O
recovered O
in O
brain O
and O
blood O
was O
reduced. O
The O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
under O
conditions O
mimicking O
encephalopathic B-Disease
crises I-Disease
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
appears O
to O
remain O
intact. O
