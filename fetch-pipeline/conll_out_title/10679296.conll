# Abstract
We O
prepared O
the O
specific O
antibodies O
for O
EXT1 B-Gene
and O
EXT2, B-Gene
hereditary B-Disease
multiple I-Disease
exostoses I-Disease
(HME) B-Disease
gene O
products, O
and O
characterized O
their O
expression, O
subcellular O
localization, O
and O
protein O
association O
among O
EXT B-Gene
members. O
Biochemical O
analyses O
indicate O
that O
EXT1 B-Gene
and O
EXT2 B-Gene
can O
associate O
and O
form O
homo O
hetero-oligomers O
in O
vivo O
with O
or O
without O
HME-linked O
mutations, O
EXT1 B-Gene
(R340C) B-ProteinMutation
and O
EXT2 B-Gene
(D227N), B-ProteinMutation
when O
exogenously O
expressed O
in O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells. O
An O
immunocytochemical O
analysis O
showed O
that O
both O
EXT1 B-Gene
and O
EXT2 B-Gene
localized O
in O
Golgi O
apparatus, O
irrespective O
of O
HME B-Disease
mutations. O
An O
immunohistochemical O
analysis O
on O
developing O
bones O
further O
showed O
that O
both O
EXT1 B-Gene
and O
EXT2 B-Gene
were O
concomitantly O
expressed O
in O
hypertrophic O
chondrocytes O
of O
forelimb O
