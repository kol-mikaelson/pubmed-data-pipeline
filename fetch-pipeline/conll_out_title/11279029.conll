# Abstract
Retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
generated O
by O
a O
two-step O
mechanism. O
First, O
retinol B-Chemical
is O
converted O
into O
retinal B-Chemical
by O
a O
retinol B-Chemical
dehydrogenase, I-Gene
and, O
subsequently, O
retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
formed O
by O
a O
retinal B-Chemical
dehydrogenase. O
In O
vitro, O
several O
enzymes O
are O
suggested O
to O
act O
in O
this O
metabolic O
pathway. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
regarding O
their O
capacity O
to O
contribute O
to O
retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
biosynthesis O
in O
vivo. O
We O
have O
developed O
a O
versatile O
cell O
reporter O
system O
to O
analyze O
the O
role O
of O
several O
of O
these O
enzymes O
in O
9-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
biosynthesis O
in O
vivo. O
Using O
a O
Gal4-retinoid O
X O
receptor O
fusion O
protein-based O
luciferase O
reporter O
assay, O
the O
formation O
of O
9-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
from O
9-cis-retinol B-Chemical
was O
measured O
in O
cells O
transfected O
with O
expression O
plasmids O
encoding O
different O
combinations O
of O
retinol B-Chemical
and O
retinal B-Chemical
dehydrogenases. O
The O
results O
suggested O
that O
efficient O
formation O
of O
9-cis-retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
required O
co-expression O
of O
retinol B-Chemical
and O
retinal B-Chemical
dehydrogenases. O
Interestingly, O
the O
cytosolic O
alcohol B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
4 I-Gene
failed O
to O
efficiently O
catalyze O
9-cis-retinol B-Chemical
oxidation. O
A O
structure-activity O
analysis O
showed O
that O
mutants O
of O
two O
retinol B-Chemical
dehydrogenases, O
devoid O
of O
the O
carboxyl-terminal O
cytoplasmic O
tails, O
displayed O
greatly O
reduced O
enzymatic O
activities O
in O
vivo, O
but O
were O
active O
in O
vitro. O
The O
cytoplasmic O
tails O
mediate O
efficient O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
localization O
of O
the O
enzymes, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
unique O
milieu O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
compartment O
is O
necessary O
for O
in O
vivo O
activity O
of O
microsomal O
retinol B-Chemical
dehydrogenases. O
