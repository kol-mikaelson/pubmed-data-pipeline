# Abstract
In O
eukaryotic O
cells, O
lysosomes O
represent O
a O
major O
site O
for O
macromolecule O
degradation. O
Hydrolysis O
products O
are O
eventually O
exported O
from O
this O
acidic O
organelle O
into O
the O
cytosol O
through O
specific O
transporters. O
Impairment O
of O
this O
process O
at O
either O
the O
hydrolysis O
or O
the O
efflux O
step O
is O
responsible O
of O
several O
lysosomal B-Disease
storage I-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
However, O
most O
lysosomal O
transporters, O
although O
biochemically O
characterized, O
remain O
unknown O
at O
the O
molecular O
level. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
report O
the O
molecular O
and O
functional O
characterization O
of O
a O
lysosomal O
amino O
acid O
transporter O
(LYAAT-1), B-Gene
remotely O
related O
to O
a O
family O
of O
H+-coupled O
plasma O
membrane O
and O
synaptic O
vesicle O
amino O
acid O
transporters. O
LYAAT-1 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
most O
rat B-Species
tissues, O
with O
highest O
levels O
in O
the O
brain O
where O
it O
is O
present O
in O
neurons. O
Upon O
overexpression O
in O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells, O
the O
recombinant O
protein O
mediates O
the O
accumulation O
of O
neutral O
amino O
acids, O
such O
as O
gamma-aminobutyric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
l-alanine, B-Chemical
and O
l-proline, B-Chemical
through O
an O
H+ O
amino O
acid O
symport. O
Confocal O
microscopy O
on O
brain O
sections O
revealed O
that O
this O
transporter O
colocalizes O
with O
cathepsin B-Gene
D, I-Gene
an O
established O
lysosomal O
marker. O
LYAAT-1 B-Gene
thus O
appears O
as O
a O
lysosomal O
transporter O
that O
actively O
exports O
neutral O
amino O
acids O
from O
lysosomes O
by O
chemiosmotic O
coupling O
to O
the O
H+-ATPase O
of O
these O
organelles. O
Homology O
searching O
in O
eukaryotic O
genomes O
suggests O
that O
LYAAT-1 B-Gene
defines O
a O
subgroup O
of O
lysosomal O
transporters O
in O
the O
amino O
acid O
auxin O
permease O
family. O
