# Abstract
NK-104 B-Chemical
is O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl B-Gene
coenzyme I-Gene
A I-Gene
(HMG-CoA) I-Gene
reductase I-Gene
with O
a O
very O
potent O
lipid-lowering O
effect. O

bile O
from O
rat, B-Species
rabbit B-Species
and O
dog B-Species
given O
an O
intravenous O

of O
NK-104 B-Chemical
were O
investigated. O
Structural O
assignment O
was O
made O
by O
liquid O

and O
proton O

analyses. O
The O
predominant O
component O
was O

NK-104 B-Chemical
in O
all O
the O
animals. O
At O
least O
eight O
other O
metabolites O
were O
present O
in O
rat, B-Species

and O
10 O
in O
dog. B-Species
These O
bile O
metabolites O
were O
purified O
and O
isolated O
by O
preparative O
HPLC. O
Biotransformation O
pathways O
elucidated O
for O
NK-104 B-Chemical
were O
as O
follows: O
(a) O
lactonization O
; O
(b) O
beta-oxidation O

the O
side-chain; O
(c) O
hydroxylation O
