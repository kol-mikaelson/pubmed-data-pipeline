# Abstract
Two O
isoforms O
of O
the O
human B-Species
ornithine B-Chemical
carrier, O
ORC1 B-Gene
and O
ORC2, B-Gene
have O
been O
identified O
by O
overexpression O
of O
the O
proteins O
in O
bacteria O
and O
by O
study O
of O
the O
transport O
properties O
of O
the O
purified O
proteins O
reconstituted O
into O
liposomes. O
Both O
transport O
L-isomers O
of O
ornithine, B-Chemical
lysine, B-Chemical
arginine, O
and O
citrulline B-Chemical
by O
exchange O
and O
by O
unidirectional O
mechanisms, O
and O
they O
are O
inactivated O
by O
the O
same O
inhibitors. O
ORC2 B-Gene
has O
a O
broader O
specificity O
than O
ORC1, B-Gene
and O
L- B-Chemical
and O
D-histidine, B-Chemical
L-homoarginine, B-Chemical
and O
D-isomers O
of O
ornithine, B-Chemical
lysine, B-Chemical
and O
ornithine B-Chemical
are O
all O
substrates. O
Both O
proteins O
are O
expressed O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
human B-Species
tissues, O
but O
ORC1 B-Gene
is O
the O
predominant O
form. O
The O
highest O
levels O
of O
expression O
of O
both O
isoforms O
are O
in O
the O
liver. O
Five O
mutant O
forms O
of O
ORC1 B-Gene
associated O
with O
the O
human B-Species
disease O
hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria O
were O
also O
made. O
The O
mutations O
abolish O
the O
transport O
properties O
of O
the O
protein. O
In O
patients B-Species
with O
hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria, O
isoform O
ORC2 B-Gene
is O
unmodified, O
and O
its O
presence O
compensates O
partially O
for O
defective O
ORC1. B-Gene
