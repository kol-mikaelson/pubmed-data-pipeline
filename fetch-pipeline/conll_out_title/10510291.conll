# Abstract
Monocarboxylates B-Chemical
such O
as O
lactate B-Chemical
and O
pyruvate B-Chemical
play O
a O
central O
role O
in O
cellular O
metabolism O
and O
metabolic O
communication O
between O
tissues. O
Essential O
to O
these O
roles O
is O
their O
rapid O
transport O
across O
the O
plasma O
membrane, O
which O
is O
catalysed O
by O
a O
recently O
identified O
family O
of O
proton-linked O
monocarboxylate O
transporters O
(MCTs). O
Nine O
MCT-related O
sequences O
have O
so O
far O
been O
identified O
in O
mammals, O
each O
having O
a O
different O
tissue O
distribution, O
whereas O
six O
related O
proteins O
can O
be O
recognized O
in O
Caenorhabditis B-Species
elegans I-Species
and O
4 O
in O
Saccharomyces B-Species
cerevisiae. I-Species
Direct O
demonstration O
of O
proton-linked O
lactate B-Chemical
and O
pyruvate B-Chemical
transport O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
for O
mammalian B-Species
MCT1-MCT4, O
but O
only O
for O
MCT1 B-Gene
and O
MCT2 B-Gene
have O
detailed O
analyses O
of O
substrate O
and O
inhibitor O
kinetics O
been O
described O
following O
heterologous O
expression O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
oocytes. O
MCT1 B-Gene
is O
ubiquitously O
expressed, O
but O
is O
especially O
prominent O
in O
heart O
and O
red O
muscle, O
where O
it O
is O
up-regulated O
in O
response O
to O
increased O
work, O
suggesting O
a O
special O
role O
in O
lactic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation. O
By O
contrast, O
MCT4 B-Gene
is O
most O
evident O
in O
white O
muscle O
and O
other O
cells O
with O
a O
high O
glycolytic O
rate, O
such O
as O
tumour B-Disease
cells O
and O
white O
blood O
cells, O
suggesting O
it O
is O
expressed O
where O
lactic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
efflux O
predominates. O
MCT2 B-Gene
has O
a O
ten-fold O
higher O
affinity O
for O
substrates O
than O
MCT1 B-Gene
and O
MCT4 B-Gene
and O
is O
found O
in O
cells O
where O
rapid O
uptake O
at O
low O
substrate O
concentrations O
may O
be O
required, O
including O
the O
proximal O
kidney O
tubules, O
neurons O
and O
sperm O
tails. O
MCT3 B-Gene
is O
uniquely O
expressed O
in O
the O
retinal O
pigment O
epithelium. O
The O
mechanisms O
involved O
in O
regulating O
the O
expression O
of O
different O
MCT O
isoforms O
remain O
to O
be O
established. O
However, O
there O
is O
evidence O
for O
alternative O
splicing O
of O
the O
5'- O
and O
3'-untranslated O
regions O
and O
the O
use O
of O
alternative O
promoters O
for O
some O
isoforms. O
In O
addition, O
MCT1 B-Gene
and O
MCT4 B-Gene
have O
been O
shown O
to O
interact O
specifically O
with O
OX-47 O
(CD147), B-Gene
a O
member O
of O
the O
immunoglobulin O
superfamily O
with O
a O
single O
transmembrane O
helix. O
This O
interaction O
appears O
to O
assist O
MCT O
expression O
at O
the O
cell O
surface. O
There O
is O
still O
much O
work O
to O
be O
done O
to O
characterize O
the O
properties O
of O
the O
different O
isoforms O
and O
their O
regulation, O
which O
may O
have O
wide-ranging O
implications O
for O
health O
and O
disease. O
In O
the O
future O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
explore O
the O
linkage O
of O
genetic B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
to O
particular O
MCTs O
through O
their O
chromosomal O
location. O
