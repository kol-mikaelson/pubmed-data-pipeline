# Abstract
The O
synthesis O
of O
DNA O
in O
mitochondria O
requires O
the O
uptake O
of O
deoxynucleotides O
into O
the O
matrix O
of O
the O
organelle. O
We O
have O
characterized O
a O
human B-Species
cDNA O
encoding O
a O
member O
of O
the O
family O
of O
mitochondrial B-Disease
carriers. I-Disease
The O
protein O
has O
been O
overexpressed O
in O
bacteria O
and O
reconstituted O
into O
phospholipid B-Chemical
vesicles O
where O
it O
catalyzed O
the O
transport O
of O
all O
four O
deoxy B-Chemical
(d) I-Chemical
NDPs, I-Chemical
and, O
less O
efficiently, O
the O
corresponding O
dNTPs, B-Chemical
in O
exchange O
for O
dNDPs, B-Chemical
ADP, B-Chemical
or O
ATP. B-Chemical
It O
did O
not O
transport O
dNMPs, B-Chemical
NMPs, B-Chemical
deoxynucleosides, B-Chemical
nucleosides, B-Chemical
purines, B-Chemical
or O
pyrimidines. B-Chemical
The O
physiological O
role O
of O
this O
deoxynucleotide B-Chemical
carrier O
is O
probably O
to O
supply O
deoxynucleotides O
to O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix O
for O
conversion O
to O
triphosphates B-Chemical
and O
incorporation O
into O
mitochondrial O
DNA. O
The O
protein O
is O
expressed O
in O
all O
human B-Species
tissues O
that O
were O
examined O
except O
for O
placenta, O
in O
accord O
with O
such O
a O
central O
role. O
The O
deoxynucleotide B-Chemical
carrier O
also O
transports O
dideoxynucleotides O
efficiently. O
It O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
medically O
important O
by O
providing O
the O
means O
of O
uptake O
into O
mitochondria O
of O
nucleoside B-Chemical
analogs, I-Chemical
leading O
to O
the O
mitochondrial B-Disease
impairment I-Disease
that O
underlies O
the O
toxic O
side O
effects O
of O
such O
drugs O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
viral B-Disease
illnesses, I-Disease
including O
AIDS, B-Disease
and O
in O
cancer B-Disease
therapy. O
