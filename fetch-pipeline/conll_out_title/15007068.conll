# Abstract
Peroxisomes O
are O
organelles O
that O
function O
in O
the O
beta-oxidation O
of O
long- O
and O
very O
long-chain O
acyl-CoAs, B-Chemical
bile B-Chemical
acid-CoA I-Chemical
intermediates, O
prostaglandins, B-Chemical
leukotrienes, B-Chemical
thromboxanes, B-Chemical
dicarboxylic B-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
pristanic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
xenobiotic O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
The O
very O
long- O
and O
long-chain O
acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
are O
mainly O
chain-shortened O
and O
then O
transported O
to O
mitochondria O
for O
further O
metabolism. O
We O
have O
now O
identified O
and O
characterized O
two O
peroxisomal O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
thioesterases, I-Chemical
named O
PTE-Ia B-Gene
and O
PTE-Ic, B-Gene
that O
hydrolyze O
acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
to O
the O
free O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
coenzyme O
A. O
PTE-Ia B-Gene
and O
PTE-Ic B-Gene
show O
82% O
sequence O

at O
the O
amino O

level, O
and O
a O

of O
-AKL O
was O
identified O
at O
the O
carboxyl-terminal O
end O
of O
both O
proteins. O
Localization O
experiments O
using O
green O
fluorescent O
fusion O
protein O
showed O
PTE-Ia B-Gene
and O
PTE-Ic B-Gene
to O
be O
localized O
in O
peroxisomes. O
Despite O
their O
high O
level O
of O
sequence O
identity, O
we O
show O
that O
PTE-Ia B-Gene
is O
mainly O
active O
on O
long-chain O
acyl-CoAs, B-Chemical
whereas O
PTE-Ic B-Gene
is O
mainly O
active O
on O
medium-chain O
acyl-CoAs. B-Chemical
Lack O

CoASH B-Chemical
suggests O
that O
PTE-Ia B-Gene
and O
PTE-Ic B-Gene
regulate O
intraperoxisomal O
levels O
of O
acyl-CoA, B-Chemical
and O
they O
may O
have O
a O
function O
in O
termination O
of O
beta-oxidation O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
of O
different O

lengths. O
Tissue O
expression O
studies O
revealed O
that O
PTE-Ia B-Gene
is O
highly O
expressed O
in O
kidney, O
whereas O
PTE-Ic B-Gene
is O
most O
highly O
expressed O
in O
spleen, O
brain, O
testis, O
and O
proximal O
and O
distal O
intestine. O
Both O
PTE-Ia B-Gene
and O
PTE-Ic B-Gene
were O
highly O
up-regulated O
in O
mouse B-Species
liver O
by O
treatment O
with O
the O
peroxisome O
proliferator O
WY-14,643 B-Chemical
and O
by O
fasting O
in O
a O
peroxisome O
proliferator-activated O
receptor O
alpha-dependent O
manner. O
These O
data O
show O
that O
PTE-Ia B-Gene
and O
PTE-Ic B-Gene
have O
different O
functions O
based O
on O
different O
substrate O
specificities O
and O
tissue O
expression. O
