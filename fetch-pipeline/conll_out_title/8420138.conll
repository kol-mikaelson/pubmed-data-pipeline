# Abstract
The O
daily O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
salsolinol, B-Chemical
1,2-dehydrosalsolinol, B-Chemical
and O
norsalsolinol, B-Chemical
as O
free, O
glucuronide, B-Chemical
and O
sulfate, B-Chemical
has O
been O
measured O
in O
parkinsonian B-Disease
patients B-Species
and O
age-matched O
controls O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
examine O
whether O
the O
determination O
of O
dopamine-derived O
alkaloids B-Chemical
in O
urine O
may O
be O
used O
as O
a O
marker O
of O
the O
decrease O
in O
brain O
dopamine B-Chemical
levels O
associated O
with O
the O
disease. O
In O
contrast O
with O
a O
preliminary O
study O
where O
the O
daily O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
total O
salsolinol B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
higher O
in O
young O
controls O
than O
in O
parkinsonians, B-Disease
in O
the O
present O
study O
no O
difference O
was O
found O
between O
parkinsonian B-Disease
patients B-Species
and O
controls O
concerning O
salsolinol B-Chemical
and O
norsalsolinol B-Chemical
excretion. O
However, O
the O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
total O
1,2-dehydrosalsolinol B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
higher O
in O
the O
control O
group, O
owing O
to O
a O
statistically O
significant O
increase O
in O
its O
excretion O
as O
sulfate B-Chemical
in O
this O
group. O
Further O
studies O
appear O
to O
be O
necessary O
to O
establish O
whether O
1,2-dehydrosalsolinol, B-Chemical
salsolinol, B-Chemical
and O
or O
any O
other O
dopamine-derived O
alkaloid B-Chemical
may O
serve O
for O
the O
detection O
of O
subjects O
with O
dysfunctions B-Disease
of I-Disease
the I-Disease
dopaminergic I-Disease
system. I-Disease
