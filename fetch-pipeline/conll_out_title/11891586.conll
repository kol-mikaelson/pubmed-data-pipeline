# Abstract
Our O
laboratory O
has O
recently O
identified O
and O
cloned O
three O
cationic O
amino-acid O
transporters O
of O
human B-Species
placenta. O
We O
have O
now O
examined O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
domain O
localization O
and O
functional O
expression O
of O
one O
of O
these O
transporters, O
hCAT-1, B-Gene
in O
a O
polarized O
epithelial O
cell O
line O
(MDCK). B-CellLine
To O
facilitate O
identification O
of O
expressed O
protein O
we O
first O
transferred O
the O
hCAT-1 B-Gene
cDNA O
to O
a O
vector O
with O
C-terminal O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
(GFP). O
The O
resultant O
hCAT-1-CT-GFP O
fusion O
protein O
stimulated O
L-[3H] O
lysine O
uptake O
in O
Xenopus O
oocytes. O
In O
confluent O

of O
stably O

grown O
on O

saturable O
uptake O
of O
L-[3H] O
lysine O
from O
the O
basolateral O
surface O
was O
stimulated O
7-fold O

Uptake O

both O

Consistent O
with O
these O
results, O
confocal O
microscopy O
of O
confluent O
monolayers O
of O
hCAT-1-CT-GFP-expressing O

revealed O
localization O
of O
the O

solely O
on O
the O
basolateral O

of O
the O
cell. O
This O
is O
apparently O
the O
first O
report O
of O
a O
cultured O
polarized O
epithelial O
cell O
model O
for O
stable O
expression O
of O
a O
cationic O
amino-acid O
transporter. O
It O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
aid O
in O
the O
identification O
of O
targeting O
signals O
for O
transport O
protein O
localization. O
