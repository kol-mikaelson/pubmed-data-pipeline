# Abstract
Reactive B-Chemical
oxygen I-Chemical
species I-Chemical
can O
directly O
cause O
covalent O
modifications O
to O
DNA. O
Alternatively, O
they O
can O
initiate O
the O
formation O
of O
lipid B-Chemical
hydroperoxides, I-Chemical
which O
undergo O
homolytic O
decomposition O
to O
the O
alpha,beta-unsaturated B-Chemical
aldehyde I-Chemical
genotoxins, O
4-oxo-2-nonenal, B-Chemical
4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenal, B-Chemical
and O
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal B-Chemical
through O
two O
quite O
separate O
pathways. O
One O
pathway O
involves O
a O
complex O
rearrangement O
of O
the O
alkoxy B-Chemical
radical I-Chemical
derived O
from O
the O
lipid B-Chemical
hydroperoxide. I-Chemical
The O
other O
pathway O
involves O
the O
intermediate O
formation O
of O
4-hydroperoxy-2-nonenal. B-Chemical
Lipid B-Chemical
hydroperoxides I-Chemical
can O
also O
be O
derived O
from O
the O
action O
of O
lipoxygenases O
and O
cyclooxygenases O
on O
polyunsaturated B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
4,5-Epoxy-2(E)-decenal B-Chemical
forms O
etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine B-Chemical
adduct O
with O
DNA, O
a O
mutagenic O
lesion O
observed O
in O
human B-Species
tissue O
DNA O
samples. O
Several O
new O
ethano- B-Chemical
and O
etheno-DNA O
adducts O
have O
been O
identified O
from O
the O
reaction O
of O
4-oxo-2-nonenal B-Chemical
with O
DNA. O
Malondialdehyde, B-Chemical
another O
genotoxic O
bifunctional O
electrophile, O
forms O
a O
propano B-Chemical
adduct O
with O
2'-deoxyguanosine B-Chemical
(M1G-dR) B-Chemical
rather O
than O
an O
etheno B-Chemical
adduct. O
Very O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
consequences O
of O
lipid O
hydroperoxide-mediated O
DNA B-Disease
damage I-Disease
in O
cardiovascular B-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
This O
should O
prove O
to O
be O
an O
important O
area O

future O
research. O
