# Abstract
Carbonic O
anhydrase O
isozyme O
XII O
(CA B-Gene
XII) I-Gene
is O
a O
novel O
membrane-associated O
protein O
with O
a O
potential O
role O
in O
von B-Disease
Hippel-Lindau I-Disease
carcinogenesis. I-Disease
Although O
Northern O
blotting O
has O
revealed O
positive O
signal O
for O
CA B-Gene
XII I-Gene
in O
normal O
human B-Species
kidney, B-Disease
this O
is O
the O
first O
study O
to O
demonstrate O
its O
cellular O
and O
subcellular O
localization O
along O
the O
human B-Species
nephron O
and O
collecting O
duct. O
Immunohistochemistry O
with O
a O
polyclonal O
antibody O
(PAb) O
raised O
against O
truncated O
CA B-Gene
XII I-Gene
revealed O
distinct O
staining O
in O
the O
basolateral O
plasma O
membrane O
of O
the O
epithelial O

in O
the O
thick O
ascending O
limb O
of O
Henle O
and O
distal O
convoluted O
tubules, O
and O
in O
the O
principal O

of O
the O

A O
weak O
basolateral O
signal O
was O
also O
detected O
in O
the O
epithelium O
of O
the O
proximal O

tubules. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
normal O
kidney B-Disease
specimens, O
this O
immunohistochemical O
study O
included O
31 O
renal B-Disease
tumors. I-Disease
CA B-Gene
XII I-Gene
showed O
moderate O

in O
most O
oncocytomas B-Disease
and O
clear-cell B-Disease
carcinomas. I-Disease
The O

distribution O
of O
CA B-Gene
XII I-Gene
along O
the O
human B-Species

that O
it O
may O
be O
one O
of O
the O
key O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
normal O
renal O

particularly O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
water O
homeostasis. O
High O
expression O
of O
CA B-Gene
XII I-Gene
in O
some O
renal B-Disease
carcinomas I-Disease
may O
contribute O
to O
its O
role O
