# Abstract
We O
had O
previously O
shown O
that O
the O
cholesterol B-Chemical
esterification O
activity O
of O
lecithin:cholesterol B-Gene
acyltransferase I-Gene
(LCAT) O
is O
destroyed O
by O
oxidation, O
but O
still O
it O
retains O
the O
ability O
to O
hydrolyse O
water-soluble O
substrates. O
This O
suggested O
that O
the O
inactivation O
of O
the O
enzyme O
is O
not O
due O
to O
its O
catalytic O
function, O
but O
due O
to O
a O
loss O
of O
its O
hydrophobic O
binding. O
Since O
recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
a O
tryptophan B-Chemical
residue O
in O
the O
putative O
interfacial O
domain O
(Trp(61)) B-Chemical
is O
critical O
for O
the O
activity, O
we O
determined O
the O
possible O
role O
of O
this O
residue O
in O
the O
oxidative O
susceptibility O
and O
substrate O
specificity O
of O
LCAT O
by O
site-directed O
mutagenesis. O
Deletion O
of O
Trp(61) B-Chemical
resulted O
in O
a O
56% O
loss O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
esterification O
(LCAT) O
activity, O
but O
the O
phospholipase B-Gene
A(2) I-Gene
(PLA(2)) B-Gene
and O
the O
esterase O
activities O
of O
the O
enzyme O
were O
stimulated O
slightly. O
Replacing O
Trp(61) B-Chemical
with O
another O
aromatic O
residue O
[Trp(61)-->Tyr B-ProteinMutation
(W61Y)] B-ProteinMutation
resulted O
in O
an O
increase O
in O
all O
activities O
(14-157%), O
whereas O
replacing O
it O
with O
an O
aliphatic O
residue O
[Trp(61)-->Gly B-ProteinMutation
(W61G)] B-ProteinMutation
caused O
a O
dramatic O
loss O
of O
LCAT O
(-90%) O
and O
PLA(2) B-Gene
(-82%) O
activities, O
but O
not O
the O
esterase O
activity O
(-5%). O
W61Y B-ProteinMutation
was O
the O
most O
sensitive O
to O
oxidation, O
whereas O
W61G B-ProteinMutation
was O
the O
most O
resistant, O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
LCAT O
and O
PLA(2) B-Gene
activities. O
However, O
the O
activities O
which O
do O
not O
involve O
interfacial O
binding, O
namely O
the O
esterase O
activity O
and O
the O
transesterification O
of O
short-chain O
phospholipids, B-Chemical
were O
more O
resistant O
to O
oxidation O
in O
all O
LCATs, O
indicating O
a O
selective O
loss O
of O
the O
interfacial O
binding O
by O
oxidation. O
Furthermore, O
replacing O
the O
two O
cysteines O
(Cys(31) O
and O
Cys(184)) O
in O
the O
Trp(61) B-Chemical
deletion O
mutant O
caused O
additional O
resistance O
of O
the O
enzyme O
to O
oxidizing O
agents, O
showing O
that O
both O
domains O
of O
the O
enzyme O
contribute O
independently O
to O
its O
oxidative O
susceptibility. O
Since O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
truncated O
phospholipids, B-Chemical
generated O
during O
the O
oxidation O
of O
low-density O
lipoproteins, O
does O
not O
require O
the O
interfacial-binding O
domain, O
our O
results O
suggest O
that O
LCAT O
may O
take O
part O
in O
the O
detoxification O
of O
these O
compounds O
even O
after O
the O
loss O
of O
its O
cholesterol B-Chemical
esterification O
function. O
