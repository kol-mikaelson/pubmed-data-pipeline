# Abstract
Methylmercury B-Chemical
(MeHg) B-Chemical
readily O
crosses O
cell O
membrane O
barriers O
to O
reach O
its O
target O
tissue, O
the O
brain. O
Although O
it O
is O
generally O
assumed O
that O
this O
rapid O
transport O
is O
due O
to O
simple O
diffusion, O
recent O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
MeHg B-Chemical
is O
transported O
as O
a O
hydrophilic O
complex, O
and O
possibly O
as O
an O
L-cysteine B-Chemical
complex O
on O
the O
ubiquitous O
L-type O
large O
neutral O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
(LATs). O
To O
test O
this O
hypothesis, O
studies O
were O
carried O
out O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
expressing O
two O
of O
the O
major O
L-type O
carriers O
in O
humans, B-Species
LAT1-4F2 O
heavy O
chain O
(4F2hc) B-Gene
and O
LAT2-4F2hc. O
Oocytes O
expressing O
LAT1-4F2hc O
or O
LAT2-4F2hc O
demonstrated O
enhanced O
uptake O
of O
[(14)C]MeHg B-Chemical
when O
administered O
as O
the O
L-cysteine B-Chemical
or O
D,L-homocysteine B-Chemical
complexes, O
but O
not O
when O
administered O
as O
the O
D-cysteine, B-Chemical
N B-Chemical
-acetyl-L-cysteine, I-Chemical
penicillamine B-Chemical
or O
GSH B-Chemical
complexes. O
Kinetic O
analysis O
of O
transport O
indicated O
that O
the O
apparent O

( O

(m)) O
of O
MeHg-L-cysteine B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
LAT1 B-Gene
and O
LAT2 B-Gene
(98+ O
-8 O
and O
64+ O
-8 O
microM O
respectively) O
were O
comparable O
with O
those O
for O
methionine B-Chemical
(99+ O

and O
161+ O
-11 O
microM), O
whereas O
the O
V O
(max) O
values O
were O
higher O
for O
MeHg-L-cysteine, B-Chemical
indicating O
that O
it O
may O
be O
a O
better O
substrate O
than O
the O
endogenous O
amino O
acid. O
Uptake O
and O
efflux O
of O
[(3)H]methionine B-Chemical
and O
[(14)C]MeHg-L-cysteine B-Chemical
were O
trans O
-stimulated O
by O
leucine B-Chemical
and O
phenylalanine, B-Chemical
but O
not O
by O
glutamate, B-Chemical
indicating O
that O
MeHg-L-cysteine B-Chemical
is O
both O
a O
cis O
- O
and O
trans O
-substrate. O
In O
addition, O
[(3)H]methionine B-Chemical
efflux O
was O
trans O
-stimulated O
by O
leucine B-Chemical
and O
phenylalanine B-Chemical
even O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
an O
inwardly O
directed O
methionine B-Chemical
gradient, O
demonstrating O
concentrative O
transport O
by O
both O
LAT1 B-Gene
and O
LAT2. B-Gene
The O
present O
results O
describe O
a O
major O
molecular O
mechanism O
by O
which O
MeHg B-Chemical
is O
transported O
across O
cell O
membranes O
and O
indicate O
that O
metal B-Chemical
complexes O
may O
form O
a O
novel O
class O
of O
substrates O
for O
amino O
acid O
carriers. O
These O
transport O
proteins O
may O
therefore O
participate O
in O
metal B-Chemical
ion O
homoeostasis O
and O
toxicity. B-Disease
