# Abstract
In O
mammalian O
germ O
cells, O
cAMP B-Chemical
signaling O
is O
dependent O
on O
two O
forms O
of O
adenylyl O
cyclase, O
the O
conventional O
membrane-bound O
ACIII B-Gene
and O
a O
soluble O
form O
of O
adenylyl O
cyclase O
(sAC). O
Recent O
elucidation O
of O
the O
sAC O
sequence O
indicates O
that O
this O
enzyme O
is O
phylogenetically O
distinct O
from O
the O
membrane-bound O
AC, O
does O
not O
interact O
with O
G O
proteins, O
and O
its O
activity O
is O
regulated O
by O
bicarbonate B-Chemical
ions. O
Here O
we O
have O
investigated O
the O
properties O
and O
regulation O
of O
this O
enzyme O
during O
spermatogenesis. O
Two O
different O
transcripts O
encoding O
a O
full-length O
and O
truncated O
sAC O
were O
identified O
by O
reverse O
transcriptase-polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
and O
RNase O
protection O
analysis. O
The O
truncated O
sAC O
transcript O
lacks O
exon O
11 O
with O
a O
premature O
termination O
of O
the O
open O
reading O
frame O
after O
the O
catalytic O
domain. O
Reverse O
transcriptase-polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
with O
testis O
RNA O
from O
adult O
mouse B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
of O
different O
ages, O
as O
well O
as O
RNase O
protection, O
showed O
that O
both O
transcripts O
are O
absent O
at O
11 O
days O
of O
age, O
appear O
between O
20 O
and O
30 O
days O
of O
age, O
and O
are O
retained O
in O
the O
adult O
testis. O
The O
presence O
of O
corresponding O
proteins O
in O
testis, O
germ O
cells, O
and O
spermatozoa O
was O
demonstrated O
by O
fast O
protein O
liquid O
chromatography O
and O
differential O
immunoprecipitation O
with O
full-length O
sAC-specific O
antibodies. O
Bicarbonate B-Chemical
ions O
activated O
both O
sAC O
forms O
and O
increased O
cAMP B-Chemical
levels O
in O
germ O
cells O
isolated O
from O
25- O
and O
50-day-old O
rats B-Species
and O
adult O
rats B-Species
in O
a O
concentration-dependent O
manner. O
These O
findings O
provide O
evidence O
that O
full-length O
and O
truncated O
sAC O
are O
generated O
by O
alternate O
splicing. O
Both O
forms O
are O
active O
in O
spermatids, O
and O
the O
bicarbonate B-Chemical
present O
in O
the O
seminiferous O
tubule O
may O
be O
a O
signal O
that O
regulates O
cAMP B-Chemical
levels O
in O
these O
cells. O
