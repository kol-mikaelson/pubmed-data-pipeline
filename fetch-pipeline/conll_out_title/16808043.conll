# Abstract
Only O
a O
few O
studies O
have O
addressed O
the O
transport O
of O
2-arachidonoylglycerol B-Chemical
(2-AG), B-Chemical
a O
naturally O
occurring O
agonist O
for O
cannabinoid O
receptors. O
Based O
upon O
saturation O
kinetics, O
these O
early O
reports O
have O
proposed O
that O
2-AG B-Chemical
enters O
the O
cell O
by O
a O
specific O
2-AG B-Chemical
transporter, O
via O
the O
putative O
anandamide O
transporter, O
or O
by O
simple O
diffusion. O
In O
this O
review, O
the O
uptake O
of O
2-AG B-Chemical
is O
discussed O
in O
light O
of O
the O
recent O
advances O
that O
have O
been O
made O
for O
anandamide O
transport, O
where O
the O
mechanism O
appears O
to O
be O
rate-limited O
diffusion O
through O
the O
membrane. O
Endocannabinoids O
may O
be O
a O
distinct O
class O
of O
agonists O
since O
they O
are O
hydrophobic O
and O
neutral, O
exhibiting O
similar O
biophysical O
properties O
to O
some O
anesthetics O
that O
freely O
diffuse O
through O
the O
membrane. O
