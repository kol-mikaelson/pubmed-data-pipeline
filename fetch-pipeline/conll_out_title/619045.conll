# Abstract
The O
role O
of O
transamination O
as O
the O
initial O
step O
in O
catabolism O
of O
methionine B-Chemical
in O
the O
rat B-Species
was O
investigated. O
[Methyl-14C] B-Chemical
or O
[1-14C]-L-Methionine B-Chemical
was O
added O
to O
tissue O
homogenates O
and O
transamination O
was O
determined O
from O
the O
counts O
recovered O
in O
a O
precipitable O
phenylhydrazone B-Chemical
following O
treatment O
of O
the O
samples O
with O
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. B-Chemical
Transamination O
of O
methionine B-Chemical
was O
detected O
in O
homogenates O
of O
liver, O
kidney, O
heart, O
brain, O
spleen, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
and O
small O
intestines. O
The O
product O
of O
methionine B-Chemical
transamination O
in O
the O
liver O
was O
identified O
as O
alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate. O
Approximately O
the O
same O
tissue O
distribution O
was O
observed O
for O
the O
conversion O
of O
the O
methyl O
or O
carboxyl O
carbon B-Chemical
of O
methionine B-Chemical
or O
alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate O
to O
CO2. B-Chemical
alpha-Keto-butyrate B-Chemical
could O
be O
used O
as O
a O
co-substrate O
for O
transamination, O
but O
inhibited O
oxidation O
of O
methionine B-Chemical
apparently O
by O
competing O
for O
oxidation O
of O
alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate. O
S-Adenosyl-L-methionine B-Chemical
was O
not O
a O
substrate O
for O
transamination O
in O
the O
liver O
homogenate O
system O
nor O
did O
it O
inhibit O
transamination O
of O
methionine. B-Chemical
Amino-oxyacetic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
inhibited O
transamination O
and O
oxidation O
of O
methionine, B-Chemical
but O
not O
oxidation O
of O
alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyrate. O
These O
observations O
are O
consistent O
with O
transamination O
being O
an O
initial O
step O
in O
methionine B-Chemical
catabolism O
and O
an O
alternate O
pathway O
for O
methionine B-Chemical
oxidation O
which O
does O
not O
involve O
its O
activation O
to O
S-adenosyl-L-methionine. B-Chemical
