# Abstract
Cytochrome O
P4502E B-Gene
(P4502E), B-Gene
the O
major O
ethanol-inducible O
P450 O
metabolizes O
ethanol B-Chemical
to O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
and O
bioactivates O
procarcinogens O
to O
ultimate O
carcinogens. B-Disease
Metabolism O
of O
ethanol B-Chemical
to O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical
in O
the O
brain O
could O
be O
deleterious O
since O
it O
can O
react O
with O
cytoskeletal O
proteins, O
forming O
adducts. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
rats B-Species
were O
administered O
ethanol B-Chemical
chronically O
to O
evaluate O
its O
