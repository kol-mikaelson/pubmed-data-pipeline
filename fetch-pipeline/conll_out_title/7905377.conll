# Abstract
Lovastatin B-Chemical
is O
a O
prodrug O
lactone B-Chemical
whose O
open-chain O
3,5-dihydroxy B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
a O
potent, O
competitive O
inhibitor O
of O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme B-Gene
A I-Gene
reductase, I-Gene
the O
rate-limiting O
enzyme O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
The O
compound O
undergoes O
extensive O
and O
complex O
metabolism O
in O
animals O
and O
humans, B-Species
with O
the O
metabolites O
excreted O
predominantly O
in O
bile. O
Radiochromatograms O
of O
bile O
from O
three O
human B-Species
subjects O
and O
of O
bile O
and O
liver O
homogenates O
from O
mouse, B-Species
rat, B-Species
and O
dog B-Species
displayed O
obvious O
species O
differences. O
Biotransformation O
of O
lovastatin B-Chemical
occurred O
by O
three O
distinct O
routes, O
namely O
hydrolysis O
of O
the O
lactone B-Chemical
ring O
to O
yield O
the O
pharmacologically O
active O
dihydroxy B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
cytochrome O
P-450-mediated O
oxidation O
of O
the O
fused-ring O
system, O
and O
beta-oxidation O
of O
the O
dihydroxy B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
side O
chain. O
The O
first O
two O
reactions O
occurred O
in O
all O
four O
species, O
but O
the O
last O
was O
observed O
in O
mouse B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
only. O
The O
P-450 O
reactions, O
hydroxylation O
and O
a O
novel O
dehydrogenation O
reaction, O
yielded O
a O
6'-hydroxylated O
metabolite O
of O
the O
dihydroxy B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
a O
6'-exomethylene B-Chemical
derivative O
as O
major O
and O
minor O
metabolites, O
respectively, O
in O
the O
bile O
of O
rat B-Species
and O
dog. B-Species
Human B-Species
bile, O
which O
contained O
predominantly O
polar O
metabolites, O
yielded O
these O
metabolites O
in O
similar O
proportions O
only O
after O
mild O
hydrolysis O
at O
pH O
5.0. O
In O
mouse B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
an O
atypical O
beta-oxidation O
of O
the O
dihydroxy B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
side O
chain O
occurred O
to O
give O
a O
pentanoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
derivative O
that O
was O
observed O
in O
liver O
homogenates. O
This O
metabolite O
was O
subsequently O
conjugated O
with O
taurine B-Chemical
and O
excreted O
in O
the O
bile. O
From O
these O
studies, O
cytochrome B-Gene
P-450 I-Gene
oxidation O
is O
the O
primary O
route O
of O
phase O
I O
metabolism O
for O
lovastatin B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
and O
dog, B-Species
but O
beta-oxidation O
plays O
a O
major O
metabolic O
role O
in O
rodents. O
