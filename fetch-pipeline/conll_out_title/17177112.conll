# Abstract
The O
role O
of O
drug O
transporters O
in O
pravastatin B-Chemical
disposition O
is O
underlined O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
pravastatin B-Chemical
does O
not O
undergo O
significant O
cytochrome B-Gene
P-450 I-Gene
(CYP)-mediated O
biotransformation. O
The O
organic B-Gene
anion I-Gene
transporting I-Gene
polypeptide I-Gene
1B1 I-Gene
(OATP1B1), B-Gene
encoded O
by O
SLCO1B1, B-Gene
and O
multidrug B-Gene
resistance-associated I-Gene
protein I-Gene
2 I-Gene
[MRP2 B-Gene
(ABCC2)], B-Gene
are O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
major O
transporters O
involved O
in O
the O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
in O
humans. B-Species
Other O
transporters O
that O
may O
play O
a O
role O
include O
OATP2B1, B-Gene
organic B-Gene
anion I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
3 I-Gene
(OAT3), B-Gene
bile B-Gene
salt I-Gene
export I-Gene
pump I-Gene
(BSEP), B-Gene
and O
the O
breast B-Gene
cancer I-Gene
resistance I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(BCRP). B-Gene
OATP1B1 B-Gene
and O
MRP2 B-Gene
mediate O
the O
hepatic O
uptake O
and O
biliary O
excretion O
of O
pravastatin, B-Chemical
respectively. O
The O
SLCO1B1 B-Gene
and O
ABCC2 B-Gene
polymorphisms O
probably O
contribute O
to O
the O
high O
interindividual O
variability O
in O
pravastatin B-Chemical
disposition. O
Recent O
small O
studies O
have O
characterized O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
SLCO1B1 B-Gene
polymorphism O
on O
pravastatin B-Chemical
in O
humans, B-Species
and O
especially O
the O
c.521T>C B-DNAMutation
single-nucleotide O
polymorphism O
(SNP) O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
important O
determinant O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics. O
Pravastatin B-Chemical
plasma O
concentrations O
may O
be O
up O
to O
100% O
higher O
in O
subjects O
carrying O
the O
c.521C B-DNAMutation
variant, O
as O
found O
in O
the O
*5, O
*15, O
*16, O
and O
*17 O
haplotypes, O
reflecting O
diminished O
OATP1B1-mediated O
uptake O
into O
the O
major O
site O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
elimination, O
the O
liver. O
The O
SLCO1B1 B-Gene
polymorphism O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
similar O
impact O
on O
the O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
single- O
and O
multiple-dose O
pravastatin. B-Chemical
Overall, O
2-5% O
of O
individuals O
in O
various O
populations O
may O
be O
expected O
to O
show O
markedly O
elevated O
plasma O
pravastatin B-Chemical
concentrations O
due O
to O
the O
SLCO1B1 B-Gene
polymorphism. O
Of O
note, O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
SLCO1B1 B-Gene
polymorphism O
on O
statins O
may O
be O
dependent O
on O
ethnicity. O
Although O
individuals O
with O
a O
diminished O
hepatic O
uptake O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
might O
be O
expected O
to O
show O
reduced O
cholesterol-lowering O
efficacy O
due O
to O
lower O
intracellular O
pravastatin B-Chemical
concentrations, O
there O
is O
preliminary O
evidence O
to O
suggest O
that O
the O
SLCO1B1 B-Gene
polymorphism O
is O
not O
a O
major O
determinant O
of O
non-response O
to O
pravastatin. B-Chemical
The O
possible O
consequences O
of O
drug O
transporter O
polymorphisms, O
especially O
the O
SLCO1B1 B-Gene
and O
ABCC2 B-Gene
polymorphisms, O
for O
the O
lipid-lowering O
efficacy O
and O
tolerability O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
in O
various O
ethnic O
groups O
warrant O
further O
study. O
