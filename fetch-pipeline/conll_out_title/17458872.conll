# Abstract
Peroxisomal B-Disease
acyl-coenzyme I-Disease
A I-Disease
(acyl-CoA) I-Disease
oxidase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
an O
autosomal B-Disease
recessive I-Disease

peroxisomal B-Disease

straight-chain I-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
oxidase I-Disease

The O
biochemical O

this O

is O
the O

Although O
some O

published, O
a O
comprehensive O
overview O
of O
the O
clinical, O

mutational O
spectrum O
of O
this O

is O
still O

For O
this O
reason, O
we O
report O
clinical O

for O
a O
cohort O
of O
22 O
patients B-Species

peroxisomal B-Disease

An O

us O

The O

In O
contrast, O

a O
