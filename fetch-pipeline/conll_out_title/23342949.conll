# Abstract
Hippurate, B-Chemical
the O
glycine B-Chemical
conjugate O
of O
benzoic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
is O
a O
normal O
constituent O
of O
the O
endogenous O
urinary O
metabolite O
profile O
and O
has O
long O
been O
associated O
with O
the O
microbial O
degradation O
of O
certain O
dietary O
components, O
hepatic O
function O
and O
toluene B-Chemical
exposure, O
and O
is O
also O
commonly O
used O
as O
a O
measure O
of O
renal O
clearance. O
Here O
we O
discuss O
the O
potential O
relevance O
of O
hippurate B-Chemical
excretion O
with O
regard O
to O
normal O
endogenous O
metabolism O
and O
trends O
in O
excretion O
relating O
to O
gender, O
age, O
and O
the O
intestinal O
microbiota. O
Additionally, O
the O
significance O
of O
hippurate B-Chemical
excretion O
with O
respect O
to O
disease O
states O
including O
obesity, B-Disease
diabetes, B-Disease
gastrointestinal B-Disease
diseases, I-Disease
impaired B-Disease
renal I-Disease
function, I-Disease
psychological B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
and O
autism, B-Disease
as O
well O
as O
toxicity B-Disease
and O
parasitic B-Disease
infection, I-Disease
are O
considered. O
