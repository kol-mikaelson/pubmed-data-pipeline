# Abstract
Islet-specific B-Gene
glucose-6-phosphatase I-Gene
(G6Pase) I-Gene
catalytic I-Gene
subunit-related I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(IGRP) B-Gene
is O
a O
homolog O
of O
the O
catalytic O
subunit O
of O
G6Pase, O
the O
enzyme O
that O
catalyzes O
the O
terminal O
step O
of O
the O
gluconeogenic O
pathway. O
Its O
catalytic O
activity, O
however, O
has O
not O
been O
defined. O
Since O
IGRP B-Gene
gene O
expression O
is O
restricted O
to O
islets, O
this O
suggests O
a O
possible O
role O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
islet O
metabolism O
and, O
hence, O
insulin B-Gene
secretion O
induced O
by O
metabolites. O
We O
report O
here O
a O
comparative O
analysis O
of O
the O
human, B-Species
mouse, B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
IGRP B-Gene
genes. O
These O
studies O
aimed O
to O
identify O
conserved O
sequences O
that O
may O
be O
critical O
for O
IGRP B-Gene
function O
and O
that O
specify O
its O
restricted O
tissue O
distribution. O
The O
single O
copy O
human B-Species
IGRP B-Gene
gene O
has O
five O
exons O
of O
similar O
length O
and O
coding O
sequence O
to O
the O
mouse B-Species
IGRP B-Gene
gene O
and O
is O
located O
on O
human B-Species
chromosome O
2q28-32 O
adjacent O
to O
the O
myosin O
heavy O
chain O
1B O
gene. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
rat B-Species
IGRP B-Gene
gene O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
encode O
a O
protein O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
series O
of O
deletions O
and O
insertions O
in O
the O
coding O
sequence. O
Moreover, O
rat B-Species
IGRP B-Gene
mRNA, O
unlike O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
IGRP B-Gene
mRNA, O
is O
not O
expressed O
in O
islets O
or O
islet-derived O
cell O
lines, O
an O
observation O
that O
was O
traced O
by O
fusion O
gene O
analysis O
to O
a O
mutation O
of O
the O
TATA O
box O
motif O
in O
the O
mouse B-Species
human B-Species
IGRP B-Gene
promoters O
to O
TGTA O
in O
the O
rat B-Species
sequence. O
The O
results O
provide O
a O
framework O
for O
the O
further O
analysis O
of O
the O
molecular O
basis O
for O
the O
tissue-restricted O
expression O
of O
the O
IGRP B-Gene
gene O
and O
the O
identification O
of O
key O
amino O
acid O
sequences O
that O
determine O
its O
biological O
activity. O
