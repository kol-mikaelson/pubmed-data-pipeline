# Abstract
S-adenosylmethionine B-Chemical
(SAM) B-Chemical
is O
the O
sole O
methyl O
donor O
in O
the O
CNS O
where O
it O
is O
involved O
in O
a O
multitude O
of O
biochemical O
reactions. O
Peripherally O
administered O
SAM B-Chemical
has O
been O
shown O
to O
increase O
SAM B-Chemical
levels O
in O
cerebrospinal O
fluid O
and O
is O
reported O
to O
be O
effective O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
numerous O
neurological B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
suggesting O
SAM B-Chemical
crosses O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
(BBB). O
The O
mechanism O
of O
SAM B-Chemical
entry O
into O
the O
brain O
remains O
unknown, O
but O
the O
presence O
of O
adenosyl B-Chemical
and O
methionine B-Chemical
residues O
in O
the O
molecule O
suggests O
probable O
entry O
via O
carrier O
mediated O
transport. O
We O
have O
investigated O
whether O
SAM B-Chemical
utilises O
endogenous O
transport O
systems O
in O
cerebral O
endothelial O
cells, O
using O
RBE4 B-CellLine
cells, O
an O
in O
vitro O
model O
of O
the O
BBB. O
SAM B-Chemical
did O
not O
influence O
the O
transport O
of O
[(3)H]-methionine B-Chemical
and O
only O
marginally O
reduced O
the O
uptake O
of O
[(3)H]-leucine B-Chemical
in O
RBE4 B-CellLine
cells. O
The O
inhibition O
constant O
for O
the O
latter O
was O
2.11+ O
-0.29 O
mM O
(mean+ O
-S.E.M.). O
However, O
increasing O
concentrations O
of O
SAM B-Chemical
strongly O
inhibited O
the O
transport O
of O
[3H]-adenosine B-Chemical
in O
RBE4 B-CellLine
cells O
in O
both O
the O
presence O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
sodium B-Chemical
in O
the O
medium, O
with O
K(i) O
values O
of O
199+ O
-32 O
and O
139+ O
-8.4 O
microM, O
respectively. O
Lineweaver-Burk O
plots O
suggest O
a O
competitive O
mode O
of O
inhibition. O
The O
findings O
suggest O
that O
SAM B-Chemical
is O
not O
recognised O
by O
the O
L-system O
transporter O
for O
large O
neutral O
amino O
acids O
at O
the O
brain O
endothelium. O
A O
significant O
interaction O
with O
the O
transport O
of O
adenosine, B-Chemical
however, O
indicates O
that O
SAM B-Chemical
has O
affinity O
for O
the O
nucleoside O
carrier O
systems; O
this O
is O
within O
the O
range O
of O
K(m) O
values O
of O
natural O
substrates O
and O
suggest O
that O
SAM B-Chemical
may O
enter O
the O
CNS O
via O
the O
Na(+)-independent O
nucleoside O
carrier O
systems O
at O
the O
brain O
capillary O
endothelium. O
