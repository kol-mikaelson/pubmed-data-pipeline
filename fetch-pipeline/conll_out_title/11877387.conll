# Abstract
UDP-glucuronate B-Chemical
decarboxylase O
(UGD) B-Gene
catalyzes O
the O
formation O
of O
UDP-xylose B-Chemical
from O
UDP-glucuronate. B-Chemical
UDP-xylose B-Chemical
is O
then O
used O
to O
initiate O
glycosaminoglycan B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
on O
the O
core O
protein O
of O
proteoglycans. O
In O
a O
yeast O
two-hybrid O
screen O
with O
the O
protein O
kinase O
Akt B-Gene
(protein B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
B), I-Gene
we O
detected O
interactions O
with O
a O
novel O
sequence, O
which O
we O
cloned O
and O
expressed. O
The O
expressed O
protein O
displayed O
UGD B-Gene
activity O
but O
did O
not O
display O
the O
activities O
of O
homologous O
nucleotide B-Chemical
sugar I-Chemical
epimerases I-Chemical
or O
dehydratases. O
We O
did O
not O
detect O
phosphorylation O
of O
UGD B-Gene
by O
Akt B-Gene
nor O
did O
we O
detect O
any O
influence O
of O
Akt B-Gene
on O
UGD B-Gene
activity. O
Effects O
of O
UGD B-Gene
on O
Akt B-Gene
kinase O
activity O
were O
also O
absent. O
Northern O
blot O
and O
Western O
blot O
analyses O
revealed O
the O
presence O
of O
UGD B-Gene
in O
multiple O
tissues O
and O
brain O
regions. O
Subcellular O
studies O
and O
histochemistry O
localized O
UGD B-Gene
protein O

where O
xylosylation O
