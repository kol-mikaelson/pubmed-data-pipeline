# Abstract
Congenital B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
of I-Disease
glycosylation I-Disease
(CDG) B-Disease
comprise O
a O
rapidly O
growing O
group O
of O
inherited B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
in O
which O
glycosylation O
of O
glycoproteins O
is O
defective O
due O
to O
mutations O
in O
genes O
required O
for O
the O
assembly O
of O
lipid-linked B-Chemical
oligosaccharides, I-Chemical

(CDG-I) O
or O

This O

Using O

lectin-staining O
procedure O
for O
detection O
of O
fucosylated O
glycoproteins O

a O
retroviral O

we O
isolated O
a O

complementing O
the O

The O
cDNA O

We O
identified O
two O

Thus O
complementation O
cloning O
allowed O
us O
to O
identify O
the O
human B-Species
GDP-fucose B-Chemical
transporter O

and O
GDP-fucose B-Chemical

as O
a O

a O
new O

of O
CDG. B-Disease
Following O
the O
recent O
recommendations O
for O
the O
nomenclature O
for O
CDG, B-Disease
this O
new O
type O
is O
classified O
as O
CDG-IIc B-Gene
