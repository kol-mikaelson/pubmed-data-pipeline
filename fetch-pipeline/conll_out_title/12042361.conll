# Abstract
The O
presence O
of O
lactate B-Chemical
dehydrogenase I-Gene
in O
skeletal O
muscle O
mitochondria O
was O
investigated O
to O
clarify O
whether O
lactate B-Chemical
is O
a O
possible O
substrate O
for O
mitochondrial O
respiration. O
Mitochondria O
were O
prepared O
from O
100 O
mg O
samples O
of O
human B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
vastus O
lateralis O
muscle. O
All O
fractions O
from O
the O
preparation O
procedure O
were O
assayed O
for O
marker O
enzymes O
and O
lactate B-Chemical
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(LDH). O
The O
mitochondrial O
fraction O
contained O
no O
LDH O
activity O
(detection O
limit O
approximately O
0.05 O
% O
of O
the O
tissue O

and O
the O
distribution O
of O
LDH O
activity O
among O
the O
fractions O
paralleled O
that O
of O
pyruvate B-Chemical
kinase, O
i.e. O
LDH O
was O
fractionated O
as O
a O
cytoplasmic O
enzyme. O
Respiratory O
experiments O
with O
the O
mitochondrial O
fraction O
also O
indicated O
the O
absence O
of O
LDH. O
Lactate B-Chemical
did O
not O
cause O
respiration, O
nor O
did O
it O
affect O
the O
respiration O
of O
pyruvate B-Chemical

malate. O
The O
major O
part O

retained O
in O
the O
isolated O
mitochondria, O
which, O
furthermore, O
showed O
high O
specific O
rates O
of O

respiration. O
This O
excluded O
artificial O
loss O
from O
the O
mitochondria O
of O
all O
activity O
of O
a O
possible O
LDH. O
It O
was O
concluded O
that O
skeletal O

mitochondria O
are O

unable O
to O
