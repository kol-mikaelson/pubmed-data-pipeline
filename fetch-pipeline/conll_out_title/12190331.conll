# Abstract
The O
clinical O
management O
of O
tacrolimus, B-Chemical
a O
macrolide B-Chemical
used O
as O
immunosuppressant O
after O
transplantation, O
is O
complicated O
by O
its O
narrow O
therapeutic O

in O
combination O
with O
inter- O
and O
intraindividually O
variable O
pharmacokinetics. O
As O
a O
substrate O
of O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) I-Gene
3A I-Gene
enzymes O
and O
P-glycoprotein, B-Gene
tacrolimus B-Chemical
interacts O
with O
several O
other O
drugs O
used O
in O
transplantation O
medicine, O
which O
also O
are O
known O
CYP3A B-Gene
and O
or O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
inhibitors O
and O
or O
inducers. O
In O
clinical O
studies, O
CYP3A B-Gene
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
inhibitors O
and O
inducers O
primarily O
affect O
oral O
bioavailability O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
rather O
than O
its O
clearance, O
indicating O
a O
key O
role O
of O
intestinal O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
and O
CYP3A. B-Gene
There O
is O
an O
almost O
complete O
overlap O
between O
the O
reported O
clinical O
drug O
interactions O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
and O
those O
of O
cyclosporin. B-Chemical
However, O
in O
comparison O
with O
cyclosporin, B-Chemical
only O
few O
controlled O
drug O
interaction O
studies O
have O
been O
carried O
out, O
but O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
drug O
interactions O
have O
been O
extensively O
studied O
in O
vitro. O
These O
results O
are O
inconsistent O
and O
are O
of O
poor O
predictive O
value O
for O
clinical O
drug O
interactions O
because O
of O
false O
negative O
results. O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
regulates O
distribution O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
through O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier O
into O
the O
brain O
as O
well O
as O
distribution O
into O
lymphocytes. O
Interaction O
of O
other O
drugs O
with O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
may O
change O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
tissue O
distribution O
and O
modify O
its O
toxicity B-Disease
and O
immunosuppressive O
activity. O
There O
is O
evidence O
that O
ethnic O
and O
gender O
differences O
exist O
for O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
drug O
interactions. O
Therapeutic O

monitoring O

guide O
dosage O
adjustments O
of O
tacrolimus B-Chemical
is O
an O
efficient O
tool O
to O
manage O
drug O
interactions. O
In O
the O
near O
future, O
progress O
can O
be O
