# Abstract
Pitavastatin B-Chemical
(Livazo B-Chemical
, O
Livalo B-Chemical
), O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
(statin), O
is O
indicated O
for O
the O
reduction O
of O
elevated O
total O
cholesterol B-Chemical
(TC) B-Chemical
and O
low-density O
lipoprotein O
cholesterol B-Chemical
(LDL-C) O
levels, O
in O
adult O
patients B-Species
with O
primary O
hypercholesterolaemia B-Disease
and O
mixed O
dyslipidaemia, B-Disease
when O
response O
to O
diet O
and O
other O
non-pharmacological O
measures O
is O
inadequate. O
Pitavastatin B-Chemical
has O
a O
favourable O
pharmacological O
profile O
following O
oral O
administration, O
including O
its O
long O
half-life O
(up O
to O
12 O
hours), O
selective O
uptake O
into O
hepatocytes O
and O
minimal O
metabolism O
by O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) B-Gene
enzymes. O
This O
latter O
property O
decreases O
the O
likelihood O
of O
drug-drug O
interactions O
with O
agents O
that O
are O
metabolized O
by, O
inhibit O
or O
induce O
CYP B-Gene
enzymes. O
Pitavastatin B-Chemical
improved O
the O
lipid B-Chemical
profile O
(including O
LDL-C, O
TC B-Chemical
and O
high-density O
lipoprotein O
cholesterol B-Chemical
levels) O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
hypercholesterolaemia B-Disease
and O
mixed O
dyslipidaemia, B-Disease
according O
to O
large, O
pivotal O
phase O
III O
studies O
of O
up O
to O
60 O
weeks' O
duration. O
In O
these O
trials, O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
for O
12 O
weeks O
was O
noninferior O
to O
simvastatin B-Chemical
and O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
in O
terms O
of O
the O
improvement O
from O
baseline O
in O
LDL-C O
levels. O
In O
similarly O
designed O
trials, O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
improved O
lipid B-Chemical
profiles O
and O
was O
noninferior O
to O
simvastatin B-Chemical
in O
patients B-Species
with O
high O
cardiovascular O
risk O
and O
demonstrated O
significantly O
greater O
LDL-C O
reduction O
than O
pravastatin B-Chemical
in O
elderly O
patients. B-Species
Furthermore, O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
type B-Disease
2 I-Disease
diabetes I-Disease
mellitus, I-Disease
although O
noninferiority O
criteria O
for O
the O
comparison O
with O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
were O
not O
met O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
improvement O
from O
baseline O
in O
LDL-C O
levels, O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
was O
associated O
with O
some O
improvements O
in O
the O
lipid B-Chemical
profile. O
Pitavastatin B-Chemical
also O
demonstrated O
substantial O
lipid-modifying O
effects O
in O
exclusively O
Asian O
populations O
in O
well O
designed O
clinical O
trials. O
Pitavastatin B-Chemical
was O
generally O
well O
tolerated O
in O
clinical O
trials O
of O
up O
to O
60 O
weeks' O
duration, O
with O
a O
tolerability O
profile O
generally O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
and O
simvastatin. B-Chemical
Therefore, O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
appears O
to O
be O
an O
attractive O
alternative O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
primary O
hyperlipidaemia B-Disease
or O
mixed O
dyslipidaemia B-Disease
who O
have O
not O
responded O
adequately O
to O
diet O
and O
other O
non-pharmacological O
measures, O
and O
may O
present O
a O
useful O
treatment O
option O
in O
patients B-Species
requiring O
polypharmacy, O
such O
as O
those O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
cardiovascular B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
Further O
studies O
evaluating O
the O
effects O
of O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
on O
clinical O
endpoints, O
such O
as O
cardiovascular O
morbidity O
and O
mortality, O
are O
required O
to O
confirm O
the O
longer-term O
benefits O
of O
pitavastatin. B-Chemical
