# Abstract
Long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
lipids B-Chemical
serve O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
functions O
in O
mammalian O
homeostasis, O
particularly O
in O
the O
formation O
and O
dynamic O
properties O
of O
biological O
membranes O
and O
as O
fuels O
for O
energy O
production O
in O
tissues O
such O
as O
heart O
and O
skeletal O
muscle. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
long-chain B-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolites O
may O
exert O
toxic O
effects O
on O
cellular O
functions O
and O
cause O
cell O
injury. O
Therefore, O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
into O
the O
cell O
and O
intracellular O
handling O
need O
to O
be O
carefully O
controlled. O
In O
the O
last O
few O
years, O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
regulation O
of O
cellular O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
has O
dramatically O
increased. O
Notably, O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
was O
found O
to O
occur O
by O
a O
mechanism O
that O
resembles O
that O
of O
cellular O
glucose B-Chemical
uptake. O
Thus, O
following O
an O
acute O
stimulus, O
particularly O
insulin B-Gene
or O
muscle B-Disease
contraction, I-Disease
specific O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporters O
translocate O
from O
intracellular O
stores O
to O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
to O
facilitate O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake, O
just O
as O
these O
same O
stimuli O
recruit O
glucose B-Chemical
transporters O
to O
increase O
glucose B-Chemical
uptake. O
This O
regulatory O
mechanism O
is O
important O
to O
clear O
lipids B-Chemical
from O
the O
circulation O
postprandially O
and O
to O
rapidly O
facilitate O
substrate O
provision O
when O
the O
metabolic O
demands O
of O
heart O
and O
muscle O
are O
increased O
by O
contractile O
activity. O
Studies O
in O
both O
humans B-Species
and O
animal O
models O
have O
implicated O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporters O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
diseases O
such O
as O
the O
progression O
of O
obesity B-Disease
to O
insulin B-Disease
resistance I-Disease
and O
type B-Disease

diabetes. I-Disease
As O
a O
result, O
membrane O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporters O
are O
now O
being O
regarded O
as O
a O
promising O
therapeutic O
target O
to O
redirect O
lipid B-Chemical
fluxes O
in O
the O
body O
in O
an O
organ-specific O
fashion. O
