# Abstract
1. O
Rat B-Species
liver O
mitochondria O
can O
accumulate O
choline B-Chemical
against O
a O
concentration O
gradient. O
Maximally O
about O
30 O
nmol O
choline B-Chemical
per O
mg O
mitochondrial O
protein O
are O
found O
in O
the O
matrix O
space. O
2. O
The O
process O
of O
choline B-Chemical
uptake O
is O
biphasic. O
After O
a O
rapid O
uptake O
of O
1.5-15 O
nmol O
per O
mg O
protein, O
a O
slower O
uptake O
occurs O
if O
an O
energy O
supply O
is O
present. O
In O
the O
absence O
of O
energy, O
only O
the O
rapid O
uptake O
is O
found. O
3. O
The O
inhibition O
of O
uncoupler-stimulated O
choline B-Chemical
oxidation O
by O
cations O
is O
the O
result O
of O
an O
inhibition O
of O
choline B-Chemical
uptake. O
