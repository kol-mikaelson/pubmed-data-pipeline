# Abstract
Vitamin B-Chemical
C, I-Chemical
a O
reducing O
agent O
and O
antioxidant, O
is O
a O
cofactor O
in O
reactions O
catalyzed O
by O
Cu(+)-dependent O
monooxygenases O
and O
Fe(2+)-dependent O
dioxygenases. O
It O
is O
synthesized, O
in O
vertebrates O
having O
this O
capacity, O
from O
d-glucuronate. B-Chemical
The O
latter O
is O
formed O
through O
direct O
hydrolysis O
of O
uridine B-Chemical
diphosphate I-Chemical
(UDP)-glucuronate B-Chemical
by O
enzyme(s) O
bound O
to O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
membrane, O
sharing O
many O
properties O
with, O
and O
most O
likely O
identical O
to, O
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. O
Non-glucuronidable O
xenobiotics O
(aminopyrine, B-Chemical
metyrapone, B-Chemical
chloretone B-Chemical
and O
others) O
stimulate O
the O
enzymatic O
hydrolysis O
of O
UDP-glucuronate, B-Chemical
accounting O
for O
their O
effect O
to O
increase O
vitamin B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
formation O
in O
vivo. O
Glucuronate B-Chemical
is O
converted O
to O
l-gulonate B-Chemical
by O
aldehyde B-Gene
reductase, I-Gene
an O
enzyme O
of O
the O
aldo-keto O
reductase O
superfamily. O
l-Gulonate B-Chemical
is O
converted O
to O
l-gulonolactone B-Chemical
by O
a O
lactonase O
identified O
as O
SMP30 B-Gene
or O
regucalcin, B-Gene
whose O
absence O
in O
mice B-Species
leads O
to O
vitamin B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
deficiency. I-Disease
The O
last O
step O
in O
the O
pathway O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
synthesis O
is O
the O
oxidation O
of O
l-gulonolactone B-Chemical
to O
l-ascorbic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
by O
l-gulonolactone B-Chemical
oxidase, O
an O
enzyme O
associated O
with O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
membrane O
and O
deficient O
in O
man, B-Species
guinea B-Species
pig I-Species
and O
other O
species O
due O
to O
mutations O
in O
its O
gene. O
Another O
fate O
of O
glucuronate B-Chemical
is O
its O
conversion O
to O
d-xylulose B-Chemical
in O
a O
five-step O
pathway, O
the O
pentose B-Chemical
pathway, O
involving O
identified O
oxidoreductases O
and O
an O
unknown O
decarboxylase. O
Semidehydroascorbate, B-Chemical
a O
major O
oxidation O
product O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
C, I-Chemical
is O
reconverted O
to O
ascorbate B-Chemical
in O
the O
cytosol O
by O
cytochrome O
b(5) O
reductase O
and O
thioredoxin B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
in O
reactions O
involving O
NADH B-Chemical
and O
NADPH, B-Chemical
respectively. O
Transmembrane O

ascorbate B-Chemical
or O
NADH B-Chemical
as O
electron O

in O
neuroendocrine O
secretory O
vesicles O
and O
in O
the O
extracellular O
medium. O
Dehydroascorbate, B-Chemical
the O
fully O
oxidized O
form O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
C, I-Chemical
is O
reduced O
spontaneously O
by O
glutathione, B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
enzymatically O
in O
reactions O
using O
glutathione B-Chemical
or O
NADPH. B-Chemical
The O
degradation O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
in O
mammals O
is O
initiated O
by O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
dehydroascorbate B-Chemical
to O
2,3-diketo-l-gulonate, B-Chemical
which O
is O
spontaneously O
degraded O
to O
oxalate, B-Chemical
CO(2) B-Chemical
and O
l-erythrulose. B-Chemical
This O
is O
at O
variance O
with O
bacteria O
such O
as O
Escherichia B-Species
coli, I-Species
which O
