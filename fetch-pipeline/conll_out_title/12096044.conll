# Abstract
The O
water B-Chemical
permeability O
of O
biological O
membranes O
has O
been O
a O
longstanding O
problem O
in O
physiology, O
but O
the O
proteins O
responsible O
for O
this O
remained O
unknown O
until O
discovery O
of O
the O
aquaporin B-Gene
1 I-Gene
(AQP1) B-Gene
water B-Chemical
channel O
protein. O
AQP1 B-Gene
is O
selectively O
permeated O
by O
water B-Chemical
driven O
by O
osmotic O
gradients. O
The O
atomic O
structure O
of O
human B-Species
AQP1 B-Gene
has O
recently O
been O
defined. O
Each O
subunit O
of O
the O
tetramer O
contains O
an O
individual O
aqueous O
pore O
that O
permits O
single-file O
passage O
of O
water B-Chemical
molecules O
but O
interrupts O
the O
hydrogen B-Chemical
bonding O
needed O
for O
passage O
of O
protons. O
At O
least O
10 O
mammalian O
aquaporins O
have O
been O
identified, O
and O
these O
are O
selectively O
permeated O
by O
water B-Chemical
(aquaporins) O
or O
water B-Chemical
plus O
glycerol B-Chemical
(aquaglyceroporins). O
The O
sites O
of O
expression O
coincide O
closely O
with O
the O
clinical O
phenotypes--ranging O
from O
congenital O
cataracts O
to O
nephrogenic O
diabetes O
insipidus. O
More O
than O
200 O
members O
of O
the O
aquaporin O
family O
have O
been O
found O
in O
plants, O
microbials, O
invertebrates O
and O
vertebrates, O
and O
their O
importance O
to O
the O
physiology O
of O
these O
organisms O
is O
being O
uncovered. O
