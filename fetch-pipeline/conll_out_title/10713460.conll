# Abstract
The O
nucleotide O
sequence O
of O
Hs O
3-PGDH B-Gene
gene, O
encoding O
human B-Species
3-phosphoglycerate B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
that O
catalyzes O
the O
initiating O

in O
the O
phosphorylated O

has O
been O
determined. O
The O
3-PGDH B-Gene
gene O
has O
a O

encoding O
a O
56.8kDa O

with O
rat-liver O
3-PGDH. B-Gene
Two O
