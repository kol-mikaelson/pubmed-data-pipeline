# Abstract
The O
neutral O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
L O
is O
a O
sodium-independent O
transport O
system O
in O
human B-Species
placenta O
and O
choriocarcinoma B-Disease
cells. O
Recently, O
it O
was O
found O
that O
the O
heterodimer O
composed O
of O
hLAT1 O
(a O
light-chain O
protein) O
and O
4F2 B-Gene
heavy I-Gene
chain I-Gene
(4F2hc), B-Gene
a O
type O
II O
transmembrane O
glycoprotein, O
is O
responsible O
for O
system O
L B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transport. O
We O
found O
that O
the O
mRNAs O
of O
4F2hc B-Gene
and O
hLAT1 O
were O
expressed O
in O
the O
human B-Species
placenta O
and O
a O
human B-Species
choriocarcinoma B-Disease
cell O
line. O
The O
levels O
of O
the O
4F2hc B-Gene
and O
hLAT1 O
proteins O
in O
the O
human B-Species
placenta O
increased O
at O
full O
term O
compared O
with O
those O
at O
midtrimester. O
Immunohistochemical O
data O
showed O
that O
these O
proteins O
were O
localized O
mainly O
in O
the O
placental O
apical O
membrane. O
Data O
from O
leucine B-Chemical
uptake O
experiments, O
Northern O
blot O
analysis, O
and O
immunoblot O
analysis O
showed O
that O
this O
transport O
system O
was O
partially O
regulated O
by O
protein O
kinase O
C O
and O
calcium O
ionophore O
in O
the O
human B-Species
choriocarcinoma B-Disease
cell O
line. O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
heterodimer O
of O
4F2hc B-Gene
and O
hLAT1 O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
placental O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
