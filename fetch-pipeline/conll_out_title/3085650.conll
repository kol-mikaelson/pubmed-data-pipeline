# Abstract
Hindquarters O
from O
starved O
rats B-Species
were O
perfused O
with O
plasma O
concentrations O
of O
amino O
acids, O
but O
without O
other O
added O
substrates. O
Release O
of O
amino O
acids O
was O
similar O
to O
that O
previously O
reported, O
but, O
if O
total O
amino O
acid O
changes O
were O
recorded, O
alanine B-Chemical
and O
glutamine B-Chemical
were O
not O
formed O
in O
excess O
of O
their O
occurrence O
in O
muscle O
proteins. O
In O
protein O
balance O
(excess O
insulin) O
there O
was O
no O
net O
formation O
of O
either O
alanine B-Chemical
or O
glutamine, B-Chemical
even O
though O
the O
branched-chain B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
methionine B-Chemical
were O
consumed. O
If O
[U-14C]valine B-Chemical
was O
present, O
radiolabelled O
3-hydroxyisobutyrate B-Chemical
and, O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent, O
2-oxo-3-methylbutyrate B-Chemical
accumulated O
and O
radiolabel O
was O
incorporated O
into O
citrate-cycle O
intermediates O
and O
metabolites O
closely O
associated O
with O
the O
citrate B-Chemical
cycle O
(glutamine B-Chemical
and O
glutamate, B-Chemical
and, O
to O
a O
smaller O
extent, O
lactate B-Chemical
and O
alanine). B-Chemical
If O
a O
2-chloro-4-methylvalerate B-Chemical
was O
present O
to O
stimulate O
the O
branched-chain O
oxo O
acid O
dehydrogenase, O
flux O
through O
this O
step O
was O
accelerated, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
accumulation O
of O
3-hydroxyisobutyrate, B-Chemical
decreased O
accumulation O
of O
2-oxo-3-methylbutyrate, B-Chemical
and O
markedly O
increased O
incorporation O
of O
radiolabel O
(specific O
and O
total) O
into O
all O
measured O
metabolites O
formed O
after O
3-hydroxyisobutyrate. B-Chemical
It O
is O
concluded O
that: O
amino O
acid O
catabolism O
by O
skeletal O
muscle O
is O
confined O
to O
degradation O
of O
the O
branched-chain B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
methionine B-Chemical
and O
those O
that O
are O
interconvertible O
with O
the O
citrate B-Chemical
cycle; O
amino O
acid O
catabolism O
is O
relatively O
minor O
in O
supplying O
carbon B-Chemical
for O
net O
synthesis O
of O
alanine B-Chemical
and O
glutamine; B-Chemical
and O
partial O
degradation O
products O
of O
the O
branched-chain B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
quantitatively O
significant O
substrates O
released O
from O
muscle O
for O
hepatic O
gluconeogenesis. O
For O
valine, B-Chemical
3-hydroxyisobutyrate B-Chemical
appears O
to O
be O
quantitatively O
the O
most O
important O
intermediate O
released O
from O
muscle. O
A O
side O
path O
for O
inter-organ O
disposition O
of O
the O
branched-chain B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
is O
proposed. O
