# Abstract
Human B-Species
lactate O
dehydrogenases O
(LDH-A4, O
-B4, O
and O
-C4) O
are O
highly O
homologous O
with O
84-89% O
sequence O
similarities O
and O
69-75% O
amino O
acid O
identities. O
Active O
site O
residues O
are O
especially O
conserved. O
Gossypol, B-Chemical
a O
natural O
product O
from O
cotton O
seed, O
is O
a O
non-selective O
competitive O
inhibitor O
of O
NADH B-Chemical
binding O
to O
LDH, O
with O
K(i) O
values O
of O
1.9, O
1.4, O
and O
4.2 O
microM O
for O
LDH-A4, O
-B4, O
and O
-C4, O
respectively. O
However, O
derivatives O
of O
gossypol B-Chemical
and O
structural O
analogs O
of O
gossypol B-Chemical
in O
the O
substituted O
2,3-dihydroxy-1-naphthoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
family O
exhibited O
markedly O
greater O
selectivity O
and, O
in O
many O
cases, O
greater O
potency. O
For O
gossypol B-Chemical
derivatives, O
greater O
than O
35-fold O
selectivity O
was O
observed. O
For O
dihydroxynaphthoic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
with O
substituents O
at O
the O
4- O
and O
7-positions, O
greater O
than O
200-fold O
selectivity O
was O
observed. O
Inhibition O
was O
consistently O
competitive O
with O
the O
binding O
of O
NADH, B-Chemical

By O
comparison, O
a O
series O
of O
N-substituted B-Chemical
oxamic I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
which O
are O
competitive O
inhibitors O
of O
the O
binding O
of O
pyruvate B-Chemical
to O
LDH, O
exhibited O
very O
modest O
selectivity. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
substituted O
dihydroxynaphthoic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
good O
lead O
compounds O
for O
the O
development O
of O
selective O
LDH O
inhibitors. O
Selective O
inhibitors O
of O
LDH-C4 O
targeted O
to O
the O
dinucleotide B-Chemical
fold O
may O
hold O
promise O
as O
male O
antifertility O
drugs. O
Selective O
inhibitors O
of O
LDH-A4 O
and O
-B4 O
may O
be O
useful O
for O
studies O
of O
lactic B-Disease
acidemia I-Disease
associated O
with O
ischemic O
events. O
More O
broadly, O
the O
results O
raise O
the O
question O
of O
the O
general O
utility O
of O
drug O
design O
targeted O
at O
the O
dinucleotide B-Chemical
binding O
sites O
of O
dehydrogenases O
reductases. O
