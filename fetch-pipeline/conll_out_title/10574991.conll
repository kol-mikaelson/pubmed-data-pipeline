Pig-n, B-Gene
a O
mammalian O

# Abstract
Many O
cell O
surface O
proteins O
are O
anchored O
to O
the O
membrane O
via O
a O
glycosylphosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
(GPI) B-Chemical
moiety, O
which O
is O
attached O
to O
the O
C O
terminus O
of O
the O
proteins. O
The O
core O
of O
the O
GPI B-Chemical
anchor O
is O
conserved O
in O
all O
eukaryotes O
but O
is O
modified O
by O
various O
side O
chains. O
We O
cloned O
a O
mouse B-Species
phosphatidylinositol B-Gene
glycan-class I-Gene
N I-Gene
(Pig-n) B-Gene
gene O
that O
encodes O
a O
931amino O
acid O
protein O
expressed O
in O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum, O
which O
is O
homologous O
to O
yeast B-Species
Mcd4p. B-Gene
We O
disrupted O
the O
gene O
in O
F9 B-CellLine
embryonal B-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
cells. O
In O
the O
Pig-n B-Gene
knockout O
cells, O
the O
first O
mannose B-Chemical
in O
the O
GPI B-Chemical
precursors O
was O
not O
modified O
by O
phosphoethanolamine. B-Chemical
Nevertheless, O
further O
biosynthetic O
steps O
continued O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
the O
third O
mannose B-Chemical
and O
the O
terminal O
phosphoethanolamine. B-Chemical
The O
surface O
expression O
of O
Thy-1 B-Gene
was O
only O
partially O
affected, O
indicating O
that O
modification O
of O
the O
first O
mannose B-Chemical
by O
phosphoethanolamine B-Chemical
is O
not O
essential O
for O
attachment O
of O
GPI B-Chemical
anchors O
in O
mammalian O
cells. O
An O
inhibitor O
of O
GPI B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
YW3548 B-Chemical
BE49385A, B-Chemical
inhibited O
transfer O
of O
phosphoethanolamine B-Chemical
to O
the O
first O
mannose B-Chemical
in O
mammalian O
cells O
but O
only O
slightly O
affected O
the O
surface O
expression O
of O
GPI-anchored O
proteins. O
Biosynthesis O
of O
GPI B-Chemical
in O
the O
Pig-n B-Gene
knockout O
cells O
was O
not O
affected O
by O
YW3548 B-Chemical
BE49385A, B-Chemical
and O
yeast B-Species
overexpressing O
MCD4 B-Gene
was O
highly O
resistant O
to O
YW3548 B-Chemical
BE49385A, B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
Pig-n B-Gene
and O
Mcd4p B-Gene
are O
targets O
of O
this O
drug. O
