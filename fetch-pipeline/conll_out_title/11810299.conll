# Abstract
Methylation O
is O
an O
essential O
process O
in O
the O
body. O
Methyl O
groups O
in O
the O
form O
of O
S-adenosylmethionine B-Chemical
are O
used O
for O
the O
synthesis O
of O
many O
essential O
compounds O
(e.g., O
creatine, B-Chemical
phosphatidylcholine, B-Chemical
and O
the O
methylation O
of O
DNA O
in O
gene O
expression). O
Glycine B-Chemical
N-methyltransferase I-Gene
(GNMT) B-Gene
is O
an O
abundant O
enzyme O
in O
liver. O
It O
catalyzes O
the O
methylation O
of O
glycine B-Chemical
by O
using O
S-adenosylmethionine B-Chemical
(AdoMet) B-Chemical
to O
form O
N-methylglycine B-Chemical
(sarcosine) B-Chemical
with O
the O
concommitant O
production O
of O
S-adenosylhomocysteine B-Chemical
(AdoHcy). B-Chemical
It O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
economy O
of O
methyl O
groups O
in O
the O
body. O
The O
function O
of O
GNMT B-Gene
has O
been O
hypothesized O
to O
provide O
an O
alternative O
route O
for O
the O
conversion O
of O
excess O
AdoMet B-Chemical
to O
AdoHcy B-Chemical
in O
order O
to O
preserve O
the O
AdoMet B-Chemical

ratio. O
GNMT B-Gene
is O
also O
inhibited O
by O
a O
specific O
form O
of O
folate, B-Chemical
5-methyltetrahydrofolate B-Chemical
pentaglutamate. I-Chemical
As O
such, O
GNMT B-Gene
participates O
in O
a O
regulatory O
scheme O
that O
links O
the O
de O
novo O
synthesis O
of O
methyl O
groups O
to O
the O
availability O
of O
dietary O
methionine. B-Chemical
This O
hypothesis O
can O
now O
be O
tested O
in O
man. B-Species
We O
report O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
two O
Italian O

are O
compound O
heterzygotes O
in O
the O
gene O
that O
encodes O
GNMT. B-Gene

evidence O
of O
mild O
liver B-Disease

Each O
bears O
the O
same O
two O
missense O
mutations, O
one O

exon O
1 O
(Leu49Pro) B-ProteinMutation
and O
the O
second O
in O
exon O
4 O
(His176Asn). B-ProteinMutation
Restriction O

diverse O

that O
these O
mutations O
are O
not O
attributable O
to O
a O
common O
polymorphism. O
