# Abstract
We O
reported O
that O
the O
activities O
of O
phospholipase B-Gene
A2, I-Gene
phosphocholine O
cytidylyltransferase O
and O
phosphoethanolamine O
cytidylyltransferase, O
key O
phospholipid B-Chemical
metabolic O
enzymes, O
are O
low O
in O
substantia O
nigra O
of O
normal O
human B-Species
brain O
and O
that O
this O
might O
reduce O
the O
ability O
of O
nigral O
neurons O
to O
repair O
damage O
to O
cell O
membranes. O
To O
determine O
whether O
adaptive O
changes O
in O
nigral O
phospholipid B-Chemical

can O
occur O
in O
idiopathic B-Disease
Parkinson's B-Disease

we O
compared O
activities O
of O
11 O
catabolic O
and O
anabolic O
enzymes O
in O
autopsied O
brain O
of O
10 O
patients B-Species

Nigral O

activities O
were O

Our O
data O
indicate O
that O
the O
normally O

of O

in O
the O
substantia O

disease, I-Disease
is O
increased O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
disorder. O
We O
suggest O
that O
pharmacotherapies O
which O
augment O
this O
compensatory O
response O
might O
have O
utility O
as O
a O
treatment O
for O
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
