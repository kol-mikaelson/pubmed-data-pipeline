# Abstract
Increased O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
medium-chain B-Chemical
dicarboxylic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
is O
a O
general O

metabolism. I-Disease
The O
physiological O
role O
of O
the O
metabolic O
pathways O
involved O
in O
dicarboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
production O
has O
been O
a O
subject O
of O
controversy. O
In O
the O
present O
investigation, O
the O
existence O
of O
3-hydroxyadipic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
3,6-lactone, I-Chemical
possibly O
representing O
a O
metabolic O
intermediate O
in O
the O
beta-oxidation O
of O
adipic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
succinic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
has O
been O
demonstrated. O
The O
identity O
of O
this O
compound O
was O
established O
by O
electron-impact O
mass O

of O
its O
trimethylsilyl O
derivative O
and O
by O
comparison O
with O
synthetic O
authentic O
samples. O
3-Hydroxyadipic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
3,6-lactone I-Chemical
is O
present O
in O
almost O
every O
urine O
sample O
we O
have O
examined. O
In O

observed O
in O
the O
adults. O
During O
fasting, O
the O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
this O
compound O
increased O
with O
time. O
It O
reached O
19.1 O

the O

of O
the O

The O

were O
even O
higher; O
urinary O

hours. O
The O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
the O
lactone B-Chemical
is O
closely O
correlated O
(r2 O

with O
that O
