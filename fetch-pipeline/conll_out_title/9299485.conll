# Abstract
In O
addition O
to O
playing O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
AIDS, B-Disease
HIV B-Species
nef O
induces O
down-regulation O
of O
CD4 B-Gene
expression O
and O
TCR B-Gene
signaling O
and O
also O
regulates O
the O
sorting O
pathway O
in O
host O
T O
cells. O
To O
elucidate O
the O
Nef O
function O
in O
HIV B-Species
progression, O
we O
searched O
for O
a O
cellular O
component O
which O
interacts O
with O
Nef. O
A O
human B-Species
cDNA O
encoding O
a O
novel O
acyl-CoA O
thioesterase O
(hACTE-III) B-Gene
was O
isolated O
as O
an O
HIV B-Species
nef-binding O
protein O
by O
yeast B-Species
two-hybrid O
system. O
hACTE-III B-Gene
is O
homologous O
to O
E. B-Species
coli I-Species
thioesterase O
II O
but O
to O
none O
of O
the O
mammalian B-Species
thioesterases B-Chemical
and O
therefore O
belongs O
to O
a O
new O
type. O
hACTE-III B-Gene
exhibits O
enzymatic O
specificity O
for O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acyl-CoAs. I-Chemical
The O
hACTE-III-binding O
region O
within O
Nef O
is O
localized O
in O
the O
central O
region O
(amino O
acids O
109-152). O
hACTE-III B-Gene
greatly O
enhances O
its O
enzymatic O
activity O
upon O
direct O
binding O
to O
Nef. O
Considering O
that O
either O
Nef-overexpression O
or O
impaired O
fatty O
acid O
regulation O
induces O
alteration O
of O
subcellular O
morphology, O
the O
augmented O
hACTE-III B-Gene
function O
by O
Nef-binding O
might O
induce O
dysfunction O
of O
T O
cells. O
