# Abstract
Glycoprotein-associated O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
(gpaAT) B-Gene
are O
permease-related O
proteins O
that O
require O
heterodimerization O
to O
express O
their O
function. O
So O
far, O
four O
vertebrate O
gpaATs B-Gene
have O
been O
shown O
to O
associate O
with O
4F2hc B-Gene
CD98 B-Gene
for O
functional O
expression, O
whereas O
one O
gpaAT B-Gene
specifically O
associates O
with O
rBAT. B-Gene
In O
this O
study, O
we O
characterized O
a O
novel O
gpaAT, B-Gene
LAT2, B-Gene
for O
which O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
cDNAs O
were O
identified O
by O
expressed O
sequence O
tag O
data O
base O
searches. O
The O
encoded O
ortholog O
proteins O
are O
531 O
and O
535 O
amino O
acids O
long O
and O
92% O
identical. O
They O
share O
52 O
and O
48% O
residues O
with O
the O
gpaATs B-Gene
LAT1 B-Gene
and O
y(+)LAT1, O
respectively. O
When O
mouse B-Species
LAT2 B-Gene
and O
human B-Species
4F2hc B-Gene
cRNAs O
were O
co-injected O
into O
Xenopus B-Species
oocytes, O
disulfide-linked O
heterodimers O
were O
formed, O
and O
an O
L-type B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
was O
induced, O
which O
differed O
slightly O
from O
that O
produced O
by O
LAT1-4F2hc: O
the O
apparent O
affinity O
for O
L-phenylalanine B-Chemical
was O
higher, O
and O
L-alanine B-Chemical
was O
transported O
at O
physiological O
concentrations. O
In O
the O
presence O
of O
an O
external O
amino O
acid O
substrate, O
LAT2-4F2hc O
also O
mediated O
amino O
acid O
efflux. O
LAT2 B-Gene
mRNA O
is O
expressed O
mainly O
in O
kidney O
and O
intestine, O
whereas O
LAT1 B-Gene
mRNA O
is O
expressed O
widely. O
Immunofluorescence O
experiments O
showed O
colocalization O
of O
4F2hc B-Gene
and O
LAT2 B-Gene
at O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
of O
kidney O
proximal O
tubules O
and O
small O
intestine O
epithelia. O
In O
conclusion, O
LAT2 B-Gene
forms O
with O
LAT1 B-Gene
a O
subfamily O
of O
L-type B-Gene
gpaATs. I-Gene
We O
propose O
that O
LAT1 B-Gene
is O
involved O
in O
cellular O
amino O
acid O
uptake, O
whereas O
LAT2 B-Gene
plays O
a O
role O
in O
epithelial O
amino O
acid O
(re)absorption. O
