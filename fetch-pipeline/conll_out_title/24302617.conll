# Abstract
We O
have O
demonstrated O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
suitability O
of O
fluorosurfactant-capped O
spherical O
gold O
nanoparticles O
as O
HPLC O
postcolumn O
colorimetric O
reagents O
for O
the O
direct O
assay O
of O
cysteine, B-Chemical
homocysteine, B-Chemical
cystine, B-Chemical
and O
homocystine. B-Chemical
The O
success O
of O
this O
work O
was O
based O
on O
the O
use O
of O
an O
on-line O
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine B-Chemical
reduction O
column O
for O
cystine B-Chemical
and O
homocystine. B-Chemical
Several O
parameters O
affecting O
the O
separation O
efficiency O
and O
the O
postcolumn O
colorimetric O
detection O
were O
thoroughly O
investigated. O
Under O
the O
optimized O
conditions, O
cysteine, B-Chemical
homocysteine, B-Chemical
cystine, B-Chemical
and O
homocystine B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
urine O
and O
plasma O
samples O
were O
determined. O
Detection O
limits O
for O
cysteine, B-Chemical
homocysteine, B-Chemical
cystine, B-Chemical
and O
homocystine B-Chemical
ranged O
from O
0.16-0.49 O
muM. O
The O
accuracy O
in O
terms O
of O
recoveries O
ranged O
between O
94.0-102.1%. O
This O
proposed O
method O
was O
rapid, O
inexpensive, O
and O
simple. O
