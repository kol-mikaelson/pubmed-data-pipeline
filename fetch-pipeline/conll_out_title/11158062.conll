# Abstract
The O
mitochondrial O
enzyme O
25-hydroxyvitamin B-Gene
D(3)-1 I-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
(1 B-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase) I-Gene
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
calcium B-Chemical
homeostasis O
by O
catalyzing O
synthesis O
of O
the O
active O
form O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
D, I-Chemical
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin B-Chemical
D(3), I-Chemical
in O
the O
kidney. O
However, O
enzyme O
activity O
assays O
indicate O
that O
1 B-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
is O
also O
expressed O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
extrarenal O
tissues; O
recent O
cloning O
of O
cDNAs O
for O
1 B-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
in O
different O
species O
suggests O
that O
a O
similar O
gene O
product O
is O
found O
at O
both O
renal O
and O
extrarenal O
sites. O
Using O
specific O
complementary O
ribonucleic O

and O
antisera O
to O
1 B-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase, I-Gene
we O
have O
previously O
reported O
the O
distribution O
of O

and O
protein O
for O
the O
enzyme O
along O
the O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species

Here O
we O
describe O
further O
immunohistochemical O
and O
Western O

that O
detail O
for O
the O
first O
time O
the O
extrarenal O
distribution O
of O
1 B-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
in O
both O
normal O
and O
diseased O
tissues. O
Specific O
staining O
for O
1 B-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
was O
detected O
in O
skin O
(basal O
keratinocytes, O
hair O
follicles), O
lymph O
nodes O
(granulomata), O
colon O
(epithelial O

and O
parasympathetic O

(islets), O
adrenal O

brain O
(cerebellum O
and O
cerebral O
cortex), O
and O
placenta O
(decidual O
and O
trophoblastic O
cells). O
Further O
studies O
using O
psoriatic B-Disease

highlighted O
overexpression O
of O
1 B-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
throughout O
the O
dysregulated O
stratum O
spinosum. O
Increased O

of O
skin O

was O
also O
associated O
with O

In O

from O
these O
patients B-Species
1 B-Gene

observed O
in O

positive O
for O
the O
surface O
antigen O

(macrophages). O
The O
data O
presented O
here O
confirm O
the O
presence O
of O
protein O
for O
1 B-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
in O
several O
extrarenal O
tissues, O
such O
as O
skin, O
placenta, O
and O
lymph O
nodes. O
The O
function O
of O
this O
enzyme O
at O
novel O
extrarenal O
sites, O
such O
as O
adrenal O
medulla, O
brain, O
pancreas, O
and O
colon, O
remains O
to O
be O
determined. O
However, O
the O
discrete O
patterns O
of O
staining O
in O
these O
tissues O
emphasizes O
a O
possible O
role O
for O
1 B-Gene
alpha-hydroxylase I-Gene
as O
an O
intracrine O
modulator O
of O
