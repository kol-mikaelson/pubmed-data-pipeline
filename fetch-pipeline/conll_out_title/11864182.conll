# Abstract
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
compare O
four O
vancomycin-containing O
agar B-Chemical
media O
for O
the O
isolation O
of O
glycopeptide-resistant O
enterococci B-Disease
(GRE) O
from O
clinical O
fecal O
specimens: O
kanamycin---aesculin---azide O
(KAA) B-Chemical
agar; B-Chemical
bile---aesculin---polymixin O
(BAP) B-Chemical
agar; B-Chemical
aztreonam---amphotericin O
blood O
(CBAA) B-Chemical
agar; B-Chemical
and O
neomycin B-Chemical
blood I-Chemical
(CBN) B-Chemical
agar. B-Chemical
METHODS: O
Fecal O
specimens O
from O
125 O
patients B-Species
were O
inoculated O
onto O
each O
medium. O
Media O
were O
examined O
for O
enterococci B-Disease
after O
incubation O
for O
up O
to O
48 O
h. O
Enterococci B-Disease
were O
identified O
to O
species O
level, O
and O
glycopeptide B-Chemical
phenotypes O
were O
determined O
by O
measuring O
minimum O
inhibitory O
concentrations O
of O
vancomycin B-Chemical
and O
teicoplanin. B-Chemical
RESULTS: O
GRE O
were O
isolated O
from O
44 O
125 O
samples. O
Enterococcus B-Species
faecalis I-Species
and O
Enterococcus B-Species
faecium I-Species
isolates, O
expressing O
glycopeptide B-Chemical
resistance O
of O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
media O
tested O
in O
this O
study, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
CBN B-Chemical
medium, I-Chemical
detected O
at O
least O
75% O
of O
patients B-Species
colonized O
by O
GRE. O
Further O
development O
of O
BAP, B-Chemical
CBAA B-Chemical
and O
KAA B-Chemical
media O
is O
warranted O
to O
improve O
growth O
and O
selectivity. O
