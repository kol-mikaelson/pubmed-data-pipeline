# Abstract
Immunoblotting O
of O
isolated O
mitochondria O
from O
rat B-Species
heart, O
liver, O
kidney, O
and O
brain O
with O
antibodies O
made O
against O
N- O
and O
C-terminal O
peptide O
sequences O
of O
the O
creatine B-Chemical
transporter, O
together O
with O
in O
situ O
immunofluorescence O
staining O
and O
immunogold O
electron O
microscopy O
of O
adult O
rat B-Species
myocardium, O
revealed O
two O
highly O
related O
polypeptides O
with O
molecular O
masses O
of O
approximately O
70 O
and O
approximately O
55 O
kDa O
in O
mitochondria. O
These O
polypeptides O
were O
localized O
by O
immunoblotting O
of O
inner O
and O
outer O
mitochondrial O
membrane O
fractions, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
immunogold O
labeling O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
inner O
membrane. O
In O
addition, O
a O
novel O
creatine B-Chemical
uptake O
via O
a O
mitochondrial O
creatine B-Chemical
transport O
activity O
was O
demonstrated O
by O
[(14)C]creatine B-Chemical

studies O
with O
isolated O

rat B-Species
liver, O

kidney O
showing O
a O
saturable O
low O

creatine B-Chemical

which O
was O
largely O
inhibited O
in O
a O
concentration-dependent O
manner O
by O
the O
sulfhydryl-modifying O
reagent O
NEM, B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
by O
the O
addition O
of O
the O
above O
anti-creatine O
transporter O
antibodies O
to O
partially O
permeabilized O
mitochondria. O
Mitochondrial O
creatine B-Chemical
transport O
was O
to O
a O
significant O
part O
dependent O
on O
the O
energetic O
state O
of O
mitochondria O
and O
was O
inhibited O
by O
arginine, B-Chemical
and O
to O
some O
extent O
also O
by O
lysine, B-Chemical
but O
not O
by O
other O
creatine B-Chemical
analogues O
and O
related O
compounds. O
The O
existence O
of O
an O
active O
creatine B-Chemical
uptake O
mechanism O
in O
mitochondria O
indicates O
that O
not O
only O
creatine B-Chemical
kinase O
isoenzymes, O
but O
also O
creatine B-Chemical
transporters O
and O
thus O
a O
certain O
proportion O
of O
the O
creatine B-Chemical
kinase O
substrates, O
might O
be O
subcellularly O
compartmentalized. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
mitochondria, O
shown O
here O
to O
possess O
creatine B-Chemical
transport O
activity, O
may O
harbor O
such O
a O
creatine B-Chemical
phosphocreatine B-Chemical
pool. O
