# Abstract
Upon O
fertilisation O
by O
sperm, O
mammalian O
eggs O
are O
activated O
by O
a O
series O
of O
intracellular O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
oscillations O
that O
are O
essential O
for O
embryo O
development. O
The O
mechanism O
by O
which O
sperm O
induces O
this O
complex O
signalling O
phenomenon O
is O
unknown. O
One O
proposal O
is O
that O
the O
sperm O
introduces O
an O
exclusive O
cytosolic O
factor O
into O
the O
egg O
that O
elicits O
serial O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
release. O
The O
'sperm O
factor' O
hypothesis O
has O
not O
been O
ratified O
because O
a O
sperm-specific O
protein O
that O
generates O
repetitive O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
transients O
and O
egg O
activation O
has O
not O
been O
found. O
We O
identify O
a O
novel, O
sperm-specific O
phospholipase O
C, O
PLC B-Gene
zeta, I-Gene
that O
triggers O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
oscillations O
in O
mouse B-Species
eggs O
indistinguishable O
from O
those O
at O
fertilisation. O
PLC B-Gene
zeta I-Gene
removal O
from O
sperm O
extracts O
abolishes O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
release O
in O
eggs. O
Moreover, O
the O
PLC B-Gene
zeta I-Gene
content O
of O
a O
single O
sperm O
was O
sufficient O
to O
produce O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
oscillations O
as O
well O
as O
normal O
embryo O
development O
to O
blastocyst. O
Our O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
sperm O
PLC B-Gene
zeta I-Gene
as O
the O
molecular O
trigger O
for O
development O
of O
a O
fertilised O
egg O
into O
an O
embryo. O
