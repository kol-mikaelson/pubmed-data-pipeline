# Abstract
Studies O
on O
the O
mechanism O
and O
enzymology O
of O
metabolic O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
isomerization O
constituted O
the O
focus O
of O
this O
investigation. O
Comparative O
in O
vivo O
studies O
revealed O
that O
this O
biotransformation O
proceeded O
via O
a O
proton O
abstraction O
mechanism O
in O
all O
tested O
species O
of O
mammals, O
which O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
the O
previous O
reports. O
Direct O
evidence O
supporting O
this O
conclusion O
stemmed O
from O
the O
in O
vitro O
epimerization O
of O
ibuprofen-CoA B-Chemical
thioester I-Chemical
in O
rat B-Species
liver O
homogenates. O
Chemically O
synthesized O
(R)-ibuprofen-CoA B-Chemical
thioester I-Chemical
was O
rapidly O
transformed O
to O
its O
(S)-counterpart O
by O
subcellular O
hepatic O
preparations. O
Examination O
of O
this O
epimerase O
activity O
in O
various O
rat B-Species
tissue O
homogenates O
indicated O
that O
this O
enzyme O
was O
highly O
tissue O
specific. O
This O
biochemical O
reaction O
mainly O
took O
place O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
kidney, O
whereas O
low O
levels O
of O
enzyme O
activity O
were O
associated O
with O
other O
tissues. O
Nevertheless, O
the O
liver O
and O
kidney O
homogenates O
failed O
to O
invert O
(R)-ibuprofen B-Chemical
directly O
even O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
all O
the O
necessary O
cofactors. O
Presumably, O
the O
failure O
to O
characterize O
this O
bioconversion O
was O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
enzymatic O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
synthesis O
in O
these O
homogenates. O
It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
the O
'2-arylpropionyl-CoA B-Gene
epimerase' I-Gene
catalyzed O
the O
transformation O
from O
either O
direction O
and O
with O
high O
turnover O
rates. O
The O
catalytic O
efficiency O
of O
(S)-ibuprofen B-Chemical
CoA I-Chemical
epimerization O
appeared O
to O
be O
greater O
than O
that O
of O
the O
(R)-counterpart. O
These O
in O
vitro O
findings O
suggest O
that O
the O
step O
of O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
formation O
assume O
a O
pivotal O
role O
in O
controlling O
the O
stereoselectivity O
and O
efficiency O
of O
the O
in O
vivo O
metabolism. O
As O
the O
responsible O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
synthetase(s) O
in O
different O
species O
of O
animals O
may O
exert O
the O
reaction O
with O
different O
degrees O
of O
enantiomeric O
preference O
and O
efficiency, O
the O
resulting O
stereochemical O
outcome O
and O
metabolic O
rates O
of O
this O
bioinversion O
vary O
accordingly. O
Consequently, O
in O
guinea B-Species
pigs, I-Species
this O
biotransformation O
proceeds O
in O
both O
directions O
with O
nearly O
equal O
efficiency, O
whereas O
it O
is O
virtually O
unidirectional O
and O
slow O
in O
humans. O
Currently, O
the O
purification O
and O
characterization O
of O
this O
novel O
'2-arylpropionyl-CoA B-Gene
epimerase' I-Gene
from O
rat B-Species
livers O
constitute O
the O
focus O
of O
this O
investigation. O
