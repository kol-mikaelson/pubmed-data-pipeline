# Abstract
UNLABELLED: O
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
an O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitor O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
hypercholesterolaemia. B-Disease
The O
lipid-lowering O
efficacy O
of O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
has O
been O
demonstrated O
in O
a O
number O
of O
large O
multicentre, O
randomised O
clinical O
trials. O
Earlier O
studies O
used O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
at O
relatively O
low O
dosages O
of O
< O
or O
=0.3mg O
orally O
once O
daily, O
but O
more O
recent O
studies O
have O
focused O
on O
dosages O
of O
0.4 O
or O
0.8 O
mg O
day O
currently O
recommended O
by O
the O
US O
Food O
and O
Drug O
Administration O
(FDA). O
Along O
with O
modest O
improvements O
in O
serum O
levels O
of O
triglycerides B-Chemical
and O
high O
density O
lipoprotein O
(HDL)-cholesterol, O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
0.4 O
to O
0.8 O
mg O
day O
achieved O
marked O
reductions O
in O
serum O
levels O
of O
low O
density O
lipoprotein O
(LDL)-cholesterol O
(33.4 O
to O
44.0%) O
and O
total O
cholesterol B-Chemical
(23.0 O
to O
30.8%). O
These O
ranges O
included O
results O
of O
a O
pivotal O
North O
American O
trial O
in O
almost O
1000 O
patients B-Species
with O
hypercholesterolaemia. B-Disease
In O

8-week O

[NCEP] O
target O
levels O

achieved O
in O
84% O
of O
patients B-Species
randomised O
to O
receive O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
0.8 O
mg O
day, O
73% O
of O
those O
treated O
with O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
0.4 O
mg O

and O

of O

Among O
patients B-Species
with O
baseline O
serum O
LDL-cholesterol O
levels O
meeting O
NCEP O
guidelines O
for O
starting O
pharmacotherapy, O
75% O
achieved O
target O
LDL-cholesterol O
levels O
with O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
0.8 O

day. O
In O
90% O
of O
all O
patients B-Species
receiving O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
0.8 O
mg O
day, O
LDL-cholesterol O
levels O
were O
reduced O
by O
23.9 O
to O
58.4% O
(6th O
to O
95th O
percentile). O
Various O
subanalyses O
of O
clinical O
trials O
with O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
indicate O
that O
the O
greatest O
lipid-lowering O
response O
can O
be O
expected O
in O
women B-Species
and O
elderly O
patients. B-Species
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
generally O
well O
tolerated O
and O
adverse O
events O
have O
usually O
been O
mild O
and O
transient. O
The O
overall O
incidence O
and O
nature O
of O
adverse O
events O
reported O
with O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
in O
clinical O
trials O
was O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
placebo. O
The O
most O
frequent O
adverse O
events O
associated O
with O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
were O
headache, B-Disease
GI B-Disease
disturbances, I-Disease
asthenia, B-Disease
pharyngitis B-Disease
and O
rhinitis. B-Disease
In O
the O
large O
pivotal O
trial, O
significant O
elevations O
in O
serum O
levels O
of O
creatine O
kinase O
and O
transaminases O
were O
reported O
in O
a O
small O
proportion O
of O
patients B-Species
receiving O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
but O
not O
in O
placebo O
recipients. O
As O
with O
other O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors, O
rare O
reports O
of O
myopathy B-Disease
and O
rhabdomyolysis B-Disease
have O
occurred O
with O
cerivastatin, B-Chemical
although O
gemfibrozil B-Chemical
or O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
were O
administered O
concomitantly O
in O
most O
cases. O
Postmarketing O
surveillance O
studies O
in O
the O
US O
have O
been O
performed. O
In O
3 O
mandated O
formulary O
switch O
conversion O
studies, O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
was O
either O
equivalent O
or O
superior O
to O
other O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors, O
including O
atorvastatin, B-Chemical
in O
reducing O
serum O
LDL-cholesterol O
levels O
or O
achieving O
NCEP O
target O
levels. O
Pharmacoeconomic O
data O
with O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
are O
limited, O
but O
analyses O
conducted O
to O
date O
in O
the O
US O
and O
Italy O
suggest O
that O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
compares O
favourably O
with O
other O
available O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors O
in O
terms O
of O
its O
cost O
per O
life-year O
gained. O
CONCLUSION: O
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
a O
well O
tolerated O
and O
effective O
lipid-lowering O
agent O
for O
patients B-Species
with O
hypercholesterolaemia. B-Disease
When O
given O
at O
dosages O
currently O
recommended O
by O
the O
FDA O
in O
the O
US, O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
achieves O
marked O
reductions O
in O
serum O
levels O
of O
LDL-cholesterol, O
reaching O
NCEP O
target O
levels O
in O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
patients. B-Species
Thus, O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
provides O
a O
useful O
(and O
potentially O
cost O
effective) O
alternative O
to O
other O
currently O
available O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors O
as O
a O
first-line O
agent O
for O
hypercholesterolaemia. B-Disease
