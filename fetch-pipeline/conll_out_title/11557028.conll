# Abstract
System O
L O
is O
a O
major O
nutrient O
transport O
system O
responsible O
for O
the O
transport O
of O
large O
neutral O
amino O
acids O
including O
several O
essential B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
We O
previously O
identified O
a O
transporter O
(L-type B-Gene
amino I-Gene
acid I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
1: I-Gene
LAT1) B-Gene
subserving O
system O
L O
in O
C6 B-CellLine
rat B-Species
glioma I-CellLine
cells O
and O
demonstrated O
that O
LAT1 B-Gene
requires O
4F2 O
heavy O
chain O
(4F2hc) O
for O
its O
functional O
expression. O
Since O
its O
oncofetal O
expression O
was O
suggested O
in O
the O
rat B-Species
liver, O
it O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
LAT1 B-Gene
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
cell O
growth O
and O
proliferation. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
have O
examined O
the O
function O
of O
human B-Species
LAT1 B-Gene
(hLAT1) O
and O
its O
expression O
in O
human B-Species
tissues O
and O
tumor B-Disease
cell O
lines. O
When O
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
oocytes O
with O
human B-Species
4F2hc O
(h4F2hc), O
hLAT1 O
transports O
large O
neutral O
amino O
acids O
with O
high O
affinity O
(K(m)= O
approximately O
15- O
approximately O
50 O
microM) O
and O
L-glutamine B-Chemical
and O
L-asparagine B-Chemical
with O
low O
affinity O
(K(m)= O
approximately O
1.5- O
approximately O
2 O
mM). O
hLAT1 O
also O
transports O
D-amino B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
such O
as O
D-leucine B-Chemical
and O
D-phenylalanine. B-Chemical
In O
addition, O
we O
show O
that O
hLAT1 O
accepts O
an O
amino O
acid-related O
anti-cancer O
agent O
melphalan. B-Chemical
When O
loaded O
intracellularly, O
L-leucine B-Chemical
and O
L-glutamine B-Chemical
but O
not O
L-alanine B-Chemical
are O
effluxed O
by O
extracellular O
substrates, O
confirming O
that O
hLAT1 O
mediates O
an O
amino O
acid O
exchange. O
hLAT1 O
mRNA O
is O
highly O
expressed O
in O
the O
human B-Species
fetal O
liver, O
bone O
marrow, O
placenta, O
testis O
and O
brain. O
We O
have O
found O
that, O
while O
all O
the O
tumor B-Disease
cell O
lines O
examined O
express O
hLAT1 O
messages, O
the O
expression O
of O
h4F2hc O
is O
varied O
particularly O
in O
leukemia B-Disease
cell O
lines. O
In O
Western O
blot O
analysis, O
hLAT1 O
and O
h4F2hc O
have O
been O
confirmed O
to O
be O
linked O
to O
each O
other O
via O
a O
disulfide B-Chemical
bond O
in O
T24 B-CellLine
human B-Species
bladder B-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
cells. O
Finally, O
in O
in O
vitro O
translation, O
we O
show O
that O
hLAT1 O
is O
not O
a O
glycosylated O
protein O
even O
though O
an O
N-glycosylation O
site O
has O
been O
predicted O
in O
its O
extracellular O
loop, O
consistent O
with O
the O
property O
of O
the O
classical O
4F2 O
light O
chain. O
The O
properties O
of O
the O
hLAT1 O
h4F2hc O
complex O
would O
support O
the O
roles O
of O
this O
transporter O
in O
providing O
cells O
with O
essential B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
for O
cell O
growth O
and O
cellular O
responses, O
and O
in O
distributing O
amino O
acid-related O
compounds. O
