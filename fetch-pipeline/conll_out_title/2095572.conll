which O
is O
a O
monolayer O

grown O
onto O
a O
porous O
polycarbonate O
membrane, O
was O
used O
to O
study O
the O
mechanism O
of O
transcellular O
transport O
of O
an O
antihypertensive O
agent, O
L-alpha-methyldopa B-Chemical
(L-alpha-MD). B-Chemical
The O
results O
showed O
that O
the O
transport O
of O
L-alpha-MD B-Chemical
was O
pH, O
glucose, B-Chemical
concentration, O
and O
temperature O
dependent, O
and O
it O
could O
be O
inhibited O
by O
metabolic O

(e.g., O
2,4-dinitrophenol) B-Chemical
and O

(e.g., O
L-phenylalanine) B-Chemical
which O
have O
an O

The O

These O
