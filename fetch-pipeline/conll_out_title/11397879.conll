# Abstract
Sulfation O
is O
an O
important O
mechanism O
for O
regulating O
the O
biological O
activity O
of O
numerous O
hormones O
and O
neurotransmitters O
in O
man. O
Here O
we O
have O
investigated O
the O
ontogeny O
of O
sulfotransferases O
(SULT) O
and O
sulfatase B-Gene
(ARS) B-Gene
involved O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
thyroid O
hormone O
and O
dopamine. B-Chemical
SULT1A1 B-Gene
enzyme O
activity O
was O
lower O
in O
postnatal O
liver O
and O
lung O
than O
in O
fetal O
tissues. O
Hepatic O
SULT1A3 B-Gene
(dopamine) B-Chemical
was O
expressed O
at O
high O
levels O
early O
in O
development, O
but O
decreased O
substantially O
in O
late O
fetal O
early O
neonatal O
liver O
and O
was O
essentially O
absent O
from O
the O
adult O
liver. O
In O
lung, O
significant O
SULT1A3 B-Gene
activity O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
fetus, O
but O
neonatal O
levels O
were O
considerably O
lower. O
In O
brain, O
the O
highest O
activity O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
choroid O
plexus O
for O
SULT1A1, B-Gene
with O
low O
and O
widespread O
activity O
for O
both O
SULT1A1 B-Gene
and O
SULT1A3 B-Gene
in O
other O
brain O
regions. O
SULT O
activity O
with O
3,3'-diiodothyronine B-Chemical
(3,3'-T(2)) B-Chemical
as O
substrate O
was O
measured O
in O
all O
tissues O
and O
correlated O
significantly O
with O
SULT1A1 B-Gene
activity O
(4-nitrophenol), B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
SULT1A1 B-Gene
is O
primarily O
responsible O
for O
the O
sulfation O
of O
this O
iodothyronine. B-Chemical
The O
developmental O
expression O
of O
SULT1A3 B-Gene
and O
SULT1A1 B-Gene
in O
liver O
and O
brain O
was O
confirmed O
by O
immunoblot, O
and O
immunohistochemistry O
of O
developing O
liver O
showed O
substantial O
expression O
of O
these O
proteins O
in O
hemopoietic O
cells O
in O
fetal O
liver. O
We O
also O
detected O
low O
activity O
for O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
3,3'-T(2) B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
by O
ARS, B-Gene
although O
there O
was O
less O
distinction O
between O
fetal O
and O
neonatal O
samples O
than O
with O
SULT O
activities. O
We O
have O
therefore O
shown O
that O
the O
developing O
fetus O
has O
substantial O
sulfation O
capacity. O
Sulfation O
may O
therefore O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
homeostasis O
of O
hormones O
and O
other O
endogenous O
compounds O
as O
well O
as O
in O
detoxification O
in O
the O
fetus, O
particularly O
as O
other O
conjugating O
enzyme O
systems, O
such O
as O
the O
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, O
are O
not O
expressed O
at O
significant O
levels O
until O
the O
neonatal O
period. O
