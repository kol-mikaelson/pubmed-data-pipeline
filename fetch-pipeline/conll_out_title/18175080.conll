# Abstract
Short-chain-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase B-Disease
(SCAD) B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
is O
an O
inborn B-Disease
error I-Disease
of I-Disease
mitochondrial I-Disease
fatty I-Disease
acid I-Disease
metabolism I-Disease
caused O
by O
rare O
mutations O
as O

susceptibility O
variations O
in O
the O
SCAD O
gene. O
We O
describe O
the O
case O
of O
a O
23-year-old O
male O
patient B-Species
who O
had O
growth O
and O
mental B-Disease
retardation, I-Disease
recurrent O
vomiting, B-Disease
fever B-Disease
and O
seizures B-Disease
since O
infancy. O
Urinary O
