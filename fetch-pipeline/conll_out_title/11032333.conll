# Abstract
We O
investigated O
the O
quantitative O
expression O
of O
the O
human B-Species
glucose-6-phosphate B-Gene
translocase I-Gene
gene O
(G6PT1) B-Gene
and O
its O
splicing O
variants O
in O
human B-Species
tissues. O
The O
G6PT1 B-Gene
gene O
was O
strongly O
expressed O
in O
liver, O
kidney O
and O
haematopoietic O
progenitor O
cells, O
which O
might O
explain O
major O
clinical O
symptoms O
such O
as O
hepatomegaly, B-Disease
nephromegaly B-Disease
and O
neutropenia B-Disease

Reverse O
transcriptase-mediated O
PCR O
amplification O
of O
G6PT1 B-Gene
cDNA O
revealed O
several O
splicing O

in O
tissue-specific O
manners. O
The O

isoform, O
which O
has O
an O

6 O
and O
8, O
was O

identified O
in O

and O
skeletal O
muscle. O
A O
new O
splicing O

although O
less O
prominent O
in O
quantity O
and O
lacking O
polypeptide O

corresponding O
to O
exons O

and O
3, O
may O

in O
leukocytes O
and O
haematopoietic O
progenitors. O
In O
conclusion, O
the O
G6PT1 B-Gene
gene O
was O
expressed O
in O
various O
tissues, O
