# Abstract
In O
mammals, O
the O
catabolic O
pathway O
of O
phenylalanine B-Chemical
and O
tyrosine B-Chemical
is O
found O
in O
liver O
(hepatocytes) O
and O
kidney O
(proximal O
tubular O
cells). O
There O
are O
well-described O
human B-Species
diseases O
associated O
with O
deficiencies O
of O
all O
enzymes O
in O
this O
pathway O
except O
for O
maleylacetoacetate B-Chemical
isomerase I-Gene
(MAAI), B-Gene
which O
converts O
maleylacetoacetate B-Chemical
(MAA) B-Chemical
to O
fumarylacetoacetate B-Chemical
(FAA). B-Chemical
MAAI B-Gene
is O
also O
known O
as O
glutathione B-Chemical
transferase O
zeta O
(GSTZ1). B-Gene
Here, O
we O
describe O
the O
phenotype O
of O
mice B-Species
with O
a O
targeted O
deletion O
of O
the O
MAAI B-Gene
(GSTZ1) B-Gene
gene. O
MAAI-deficient B-Disease
mice B-Species
accumulated O
FAA B-Chemical
and O
succinylacetone B-Chemical
in O
urine O
but O
appeared O
otherwise O
healthy. O
This O
observation O
suggested O
that O
either O
accumulating O
MAA B-Chemical
is O
not O
toxic O
or O
an O
alternate O
pathway O
for O
MAA B-Chemical
metabolism O
exists. O
A O
complete O
redundancy O
of O
MAAI B-Gene
could O
be O
ruled O
out O
because O
substrate O
overload O
of O
the O
tyrosine B-Chemical
catabolic O
pathway O
(administration O
of O
homogentisic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
phenylalanine, B-Chemical
or O
tyrosine) B-Chemical
resulted O
in O
renal B-Disease
and I-Disease
hepatic I-Disease
damage. I-Disease
However, O
evidence O
for O
a O
partial O
bypass O
of O
MAAI B-Gene
activity O
was O
also O
found. O
Mice B-Species
doubly O
mutant O
for O
MAAI B-Gene
and O
fumarylacetoacetate B-Gene
hydrolase I-Gene
(FAH) B-Gene
died O
rapidly O
on O
a O
normal O
diet, O
indicating O
that O
MAA B-Chemical
could O
be O
isomerized O
to O
FAA B-Chemical
in O
the O
absence O
of O
MAAI. B-Gene
Double O
mutants O
showed O
predominant O
renal B-Disease
injury, I-Disease
indicating O
that O
this O
organ O
is O
the O
primary O
target O
for O
the O
accumulated O
compound(s) O
resulting O
from O
MAAI B-Gene
deficiency. I-Disease
A O
glutathione-mediated O
isomerization O
of O
MAA B-Chemical
to O
FAA B-Chemical
independent O
of O
MAAI B-Gene
enzyme O
was O
demonstrated O
in O
vitro. O
This O
nonenzymatic O
bypass O
is O
likely O
responsible O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
phenotype O
in O
nonstressed O
MAAI B-Gene
mutant O
mice. B-Species
