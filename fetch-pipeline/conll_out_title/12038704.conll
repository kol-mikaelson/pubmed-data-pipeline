# Abstract
It O
has O
been O
hypothesized O
that O
the O
ratio O
of O
urinary O
2-hydroxyestrone B-Chemical
to O
16alpha-hydroxyestrone B-Chemical
(2-OHE1 B-Chemical
16alpha-OHE1 B-Gene
represents O
a O
biomarker O
for O
breast B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
risk; O
the O
lower O
the O
ratio O
the O
higher O
the O
risk. O
We O
obtained O
early O
morning O
urine O
samples O
from O
70 O
'high O
risk' O
premenopausal O
women B-Species
who O
had O
a O
first O
degree O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
and O
27 O
'low O
risk' O
women B-Species
with O
no O
such O
history. O
Five O
estrogen O
metabolites O
in O
urine O
were O
determined: O
2-OHE1, B-Chemical
16alpha-OHE1, B-Gene
estrone B-Chemical
(E1), B-Chemical
estradiol B-Chemical
(E2), B-Chemical
and O
estriol B-Chemical
(E3) B-Chemical
conjugates. O
We O
compared O
geometric O
mean O
levels O
of O
each O
metabolite O
adjusted O
for O
age O
and O
weight. O
'High O
risk' O
women B-Species
did O
not O
have O
elevated O
levels O
of O
any O
of O
these O
metabolites. O
Instead, O
we O
observed O
decrements O
of O
3-27% O
in O
women B-Species
with O
a O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
compared O
with O
women B-Species
without O
such O
history, O
this O
difference O
was O
statistically O
significant O
for O

OHE1, O
and O
16alpha-OHE1. B-Gene
The O
ratio O
of O
2-OHE1 B-Chemical
16alpha-OHE1 B-Gene
was O
identical O
in O
women B-Species
with O
and O
without O
a O
family O
history O
of O
breast B-Disease
cancer. I-Disease
These O
results O
were O
unchanged, O
when O
additionally O
adjusted O
for O
recent O
intake O
of O
alcohol B-Chemical
or O
cruciferous O
vegetables. O
Our O
data O
suggest O
that O
among O
premenopausal O
women, B-Species
family O
history O
is O
not O
associated O
with O
higher O
urinary O
estrogen O
levels O
or O
a O
lower O
