# Abstract
In O
this O
report, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
Na+ B-Gene
Ca2+ B-Chemical
exchanger I-Gene
activity O
in O
a O
human B-Species
megakaryocytic O
cell O
line O
(CHRF-288 B-CellLine
cells) O
is O
K+ O
dependent, O
similar O
to O
the O
properties O
previously O
described O
for O
Na+ O
Ca2+ B-Chemical
exchange O
activity O
in O
human B-Species
platelets. O
With O
the O
use O
of O
RT-PCR O
techniques O
and O
mRNA, O
the O
exchanger O
expressed O
in O
CHRF-288 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
found O
to O
be O
identical O
to O
that O
expressed O
in O
human B-Species
retinal O
rods. O
Northern O

analysis O
of O
the O
mRNA O
for O
the O
human B-Species
retinal O
rod O
exchanger O
in O
CHRF-288 B-CellLine
cells O
revealed O
a O
major O
transcript O
at O
5.8 O
kb O
with O
two O
minor O
bands O
at O
4.9 O
and O
6.8 O
kb. O
mRNA O
for O
the O
retinal O
rod O
exchanger O
was O
also O
identified O
in O
human B-Species
platelets. O
Using O
Ba2+ B-Chemical
influx O
as O
a O
measure O
of O
Na+ O
Ca2+ B-Chemical
exchange O
activity O
in O
human B-Species
platelets, O
we O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
exchange O
activity O
is O
driven O
by O
the O
transmembrane O
gradient O
for O
K+ O
as O
well O
as O
that O
for O
Na+. O
We O
propose O
that O
the O
K+ O
dependence O
of O
the O
platelet O
Na+ B-Gene
Ca2+ B-Chemical
exchanger I-Gene
could O
make O
platelets O
especially O
sensitive O
to O
daily O
fluctuations O
in O
salt O
intake. O
