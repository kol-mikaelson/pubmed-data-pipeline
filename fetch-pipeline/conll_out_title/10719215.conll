# Abstract
Various O
cDNAs O
that O
encode O
overlapping O
portions O
of O
the O
full-length O
human B-Species
brain O
glutaminase B-Gene
(GA) B-Gene
cDNA O
were O
cloned O
and O
sequenced. O
The O
overall O
nucleotide O
sequence O
of O
hGA O
has O
a O
very O
high O
degree O
of O
identity O
with O
that O
of O
the O
rat B-Species
kidney-type O
GA B-Gene
cDNA O
(77.4%) O
and O
the O
known O
portion O
of O
the O
cDNA O
that O
encodes O
the O
5.0-kb O
porcine O
GA B-Gene
mRNA O
(81.1%). O
The O
identity O
is O
even O
more O
remarkable O
at O
the O
amino O
acid O
level, O
particularly O
in O
the O
C-terminal O
half O
where O
the O
three O
proteins O
share O
a O
99.7% O
sequence O
identity. O
The O
hGA O
cDNA O
encodes O
a O
73,427-Da O
protein O
that O
contains O
an O
N-terminal O
mitochondrial O
targeting O
signal O
and O
retains O
the O
primary O
proteolytic O
cleavage O
site O
characterized O
for O
the O
cytosolic O
precursor O
of O
the O
rat B-Species
renal O
mitochondrial O
glutaminase. B-Gene
The O
entire O
coding O
region O
was O
assembled O
through O
the O
use O
of O
unique O
restriction O
sites O
and O
cloned O
into O
a O
baculovirus. O
Sf9 B-CellLine
cells O
infected O
with O
the O
recombinant O
virus O
express O
high O
levels O
of O
properly O
processed O
and O
active O
glutaminase. B-Gene
Thus, O
expression O
of O
the O
isolated O
hGA O
cDNA O
should O
provide O
a O
means O
to O
purify O
large O
amounts O
of O
the O
mitochondrial O
glutaminase, B-Gene
a O
protein O
that O
catalyzes O
a O
key O
reaction O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
glutamine O
and O
the O
synthesis O
of O
important O
excitatory O
and O
inhibitory O
neurotransmitters. O
