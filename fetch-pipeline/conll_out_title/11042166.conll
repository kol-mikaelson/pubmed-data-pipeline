# Abstract
We O
have O
isolated O
three O
types O
of O
cDNAs O
encoding O
novel O
beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases O
(designated O
beta3Gn-T2, B-Gene
-T3, O
and O
-T4) O
from O
human B-Species
gastric O
mucosa O
and O
the O
neuroblastoma B-Disease
cell O
line O
SK-N-MC. B-CellLine
These O
enzymes O
are O
predicted O
to O
be O
type O
2 O
transmembrane O
proteins O
of O
397, O
372, O
and O
378 O
amino O
acids, O
respectively. O
They O
share O
motifs O
conserved O
among O
members O
of O
the O
beta1,3-galactosyltransferase O
family O
and O
a O
beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase O
(designated O
beta3Gn-T1), B-Gene
but O
show O
no O
structural O
similarity O
to O
another O
type O
of O
beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase O
(iGnT). B-Gene
Each O
of O
the O
enzymes O
expressed O
by O
insect B-CellLine
cells O
as O
a O
secreted O
protein O
fused O
to O
the O
FLAG O
peptide O
showed O
beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase O
activity O
for O
type B-Chemical
2 I-Chemical
oligosaccharides I-Chemical
but O
not O
beta1,3-galactosyltransferase O
activity. O
These O
enzymes O
exhibited O
different O
substrate O
specificity. O
Transfection O
of O
Namalwa B-CellLine
KJM-1 I-CellLine
cells O
with O
beta3Gn-T2, B-Gene
-T3, O
or O
-T4 O
cDNA O
led O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
poly-N-acetyllactosamines B-Chemical
recognized O
by O
an O
anti-i-antigen O
antibody O
or O
specific O
lectins. O
The O
expression O
profiles O
of O
these O
beta3Gn-Ts O
were O
different O
among O
35 O
human B-Species
tissues. O
beta3Gn-T2 B-Gene
was O
ubiquitously O
expressed, O
whereas O
expression O
of O
beta3Gn-T3 B-Gene
and O
-T4 O
was O
relatively O
restricted. O
beta3Gn-T3 B-Gene
was O
expressed O
in O
colon, O
jejunum, O
stomach, O
esophagus, O
placenta, O
and O
trachea. O
beta3Gn-T4 O
was O
mainly O
expressed O
in O
brain. O
These O
results O
have O
revealed O
that O
several O
beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases O
form O
a O
family O
with O
structural O
similarity O
to O
the O
beta1,3-galactosyltransferase O
family. O
Considering O
the O
differences O
in O
substrate O
specificity O
and O
distribution, O
each O
beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase O
may O
play O
different O
roles. O
