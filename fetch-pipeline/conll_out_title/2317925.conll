# Abstract
Prolidase B-Gene
I O
(EC O
3.4.13.9) O
was O
purified O
to O
homogeneity O
from O
the O
erythrocytes O
of O
a O
normal O
human B-Species
(control) O
and O
the O
patient's O
mother, O
and O
prolidase B-Gene
II O
from O
erythrocytes O
of O
a O
control O
and O
the O
patient's O
mother, O
and O
prolidase B-Gene
from O
the O
patient's O
erythrocytes O
was O
also O
highly O
purified. O
The O
various O
properties O
of O
the O
patient's O
prolidase B-Gene
were O
compared O
to O
those O
of O
prolidase B-Gene
from O
a O
control O
and O
the O
patient's O
mother. O
Prolidase B-Gene
I O
from O
a O
control O
and O
the O
patient's O
mother O
had O
a O
molecular O

of O
about O
112,000, O
and O
was O
composed O
of O
two O
subunits O
with O
an O
identical O
molecular O
weight O
of O
56,000. O

reduced O
about O
30% O

the O
patient's O
prolidase B-Gene
had O
a O
molecular O
