# Abstract
Gliclazide, B-Chemical
1-(3-azabicyclo[3,3,0]oct-3-yl)-3-(4-methylphenylsulphonyl)urea, B-Chemical
was O
orally O
administered O
to O
five O
healthy O
male O
volunteers O
at O
a O
dose O
of O
40 O
mg. O
Urine O
contained O
seven O
metabolites O
classified O
into O
two O
types O
according O
to O
the O
site O
of O
biotransformation. O
Two O
major O
metabolites, O
1-(3-azabicyclo[3,3,0]oct-3-yl)-3-(4-carboxyphenylsulphonyl)urea O
and O
1-(3-azabiyclo[3,3,0]oct-3-yl)-3-(4-hydroxymethyl-phenylsulphon O
yl)urea, O
of O
the O
first O
type O
were O
oxidized O
at O
the O
methyl O
group O
of O
the O
tolyl O
group. O
Five O
metabolites O
of O
the O
second O
type O
including O
two O
glucuronides O
were O
hydroxylated O
at O
a O
specific O
site O
in O
the O
azabicyclo-octyl O
ring O
(b O
beta, O
7 O
beta O
and O
7 O
alpha). O
The O
molecular O
conformation O
of O
this O
type O
of O
metabolites O
could O
explain O
the O
existence O
of O
conjugates O
of O
the O
beta-hydroxy O
groups O
in O
the O
azabicyclo-octyl O
ring O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
those O
of O
the O
alpha-hydroxy O
group. O
Only O
the O
unchanged O
drug O
was O
detected O
in O
plasma. O
The O
peak O
concentration O
at O
four O
hours O
after O
dosing O
was O
2.6 O
+ O
- O
0.2 O
microgram O
ml, O
and O
the O
elimination O
half-life O
in O
plasma O
was O
8.1 O

1.1 O
hours O
which O
was O
apparently O
determined O
by O
the O
rate O
of O
metabolism. O
Identified O
metabolites O
excreted O
in O
urine O
accounted O
for O
45% O
of O
the O
dose O
in O
24h O
and O
61% O
in O
96h, O
indicating O
that O
this O
was O
the O
major O
excretory O
route. O
