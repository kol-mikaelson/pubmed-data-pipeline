# Abstract
The O
reaction O
of O
cholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
CoA B-Chemical
and O
ATP B-Chemical
to O
yield O
cholyl-CoA B-Chemical
was O
investigated O
by O
kinetic O
analysis O
of O
the O
reaction O
as O
catalysed O
by O
guinea B-Species
pig I-Species
liver O
microsomes. O
The O
enzyme O
has O
an O
absolute O
requirement O
for O
divalent O
cation O
for O
activity O
so O
all O
kinetic O
analyses O
were O
carried O
out O
in O
excess O
Mn2+. B-Chemical
A O
trisubstrate B-Chemical
kinetic O
analysis O
was O
conducted O
by O
varying, O
one O

a O
time O
ATP B-Chemical
cholate B-Chemical
and O
CoA. B-Chemical
Both O
ATP B-Chemical
and O
cholate B-Chemical
gave O
parallel O
double O
reciprocal O
plots O
versus O
CoA, B-Chemical
which O
indicates O
a O
ping-pong O
mechanism O
with O
either O
pyrophosphate B-Chemical
or O
AMP B-Chemical
leaving O
prior O
to O
the O
binding O
of O
CoA. B-Chemical
Addition O
of O
pyrophosphate B-Chemical
to O
the O
assays O
changed O
the O
parallel O
plots O
to O
intersecting O
ones; O
addition O
of O
AMP B-Chemical
did O
not. O
This O
indicates O
that O
pyrophosphate B-Chemical
is O
the O
first O
product. O
The O
end-product, O
AMP, B-Chemical
was O
a O
competitive O
inhibitor O
versus O
ATP, B-Chemical
as O
was O
cholyl-CoA B-Chemical
at O
saturating O
concentrations O
of O
cholate. B-Chemical
Both O
AMP B-Chemical
and O
cholyl-CoA B-Chemical
were O
uncompetitive O
inhibitors O
versus O
CoA. B-Chemical
Based O
on O
this O
information, O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
the O
reaction O
follows O
a O
bi O
uni O
uni O
bi O
ping-pong O
mechanism O
with O
ATP B-Chemical
binding O
first, O
and O
with O
the O
release O
of O
the O
final O
products, O
AMP B-Chemical
and O
cholyl-CoA, B-Chemical
being O
random. O
CoA B-Chemical
showed O
substrate O
inhibition O
at O
high O
but O
non-saturating O
concentrations O
and O
this O
inhibition O
was O
competitive O
versus O
ATP, B-Chemical
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
predicted O
ping-pong O
mechanism. O
The O
ability O
of O
cholyl-CoA, B-Chemical
but O
not O
cholate B-Chemical
or O
CoA, B-Chemical
to O
bind O
with O
high O
affinity O
to O
the O
free O
enzyme O
was O
suggestive O
of O
a O
high O
affinity O
of O
the O
enzyme O
for O
the O
thioester O
link. O
