# Abstract
We O
showed O
in O
human B-Species
melanoma B-Disease
cells O
tryptophan O
hydroxylase O
(TPH) O
and O
hydroxyindole O
methyltransferase O
genes O
expression O
with O
the O
sequential O
enzymatic O
activities O
of O
TPH, O
serotonin B-Gene
(Ser) I-Gene
N-acetyltransferase I-Gene
and O
hydroxyindole O
methyltransferase. O
The O
presence O
of O
the O
products O
Ser, O
5OH-tryptophan, B-Chemical
N-acetylserotonin, B-Chemical
melatonin B-Chemical
(Mel), B-Chemical
5-methoxytryptamine B-Chemical
and O
5-methoxytryptophol B-Chemical
was O
documented O
by O
liquid O
chromatography-mass O
spectrometry. O
Thus, O
human B-Species
melanoma B-Disease
cells O
can O
synthesize O
