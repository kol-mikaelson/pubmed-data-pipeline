# Abstract
We O
have O
reported O
fatty B-Chemical
alcohol I-Chemical
synthesis O
accompanied O
by O
chain O
elongation O
in O
liver O
peroxisomes O
(Biochim. O
Biophys. O
Acta, O
1346, O
38 O
(1997)). O
In O
the O
present O
experiment, O
we O
studied O
what O
kind O
of O
acyl-CoA(s) B-Chemical
destined O
to O
be O
utilized O
as O
primer O
for O
fatty B-Chemical
alcohol I-Chemical
synthesis O
accumulate(s) O
during O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation. O
Peroxisomes O
were O
prepared O
from O
rat B-Species
liver O
treated O
with O
clofibrate, B-Chemical
a O
peroxisome O
proliferator, O
and O
incubated O
with O
[U-14C]palmitate, B-Chemical
in O
order O
to O
investigate O
acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
after O
beta-oxidation. O
At O
1 O
mM O
concentration, O
MgATP B-Chemical
activated O
beta-oxidation, O
but O
inhibited O
beta-oxidation O
at O
concentrations O
higher O
than O
1 O
mM. O
After O
incubation O
of O
peroxisomes O
with O
palmitate, B-Chemical
various O
acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
were O
formed. O
Among O
medium-chain O
labelled O
acyl-CoAs, B-Chemical
octanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
was O
mainly O
detected. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
octanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
accumulates O
during O
beta-oxidation O
of O
palmitate. B-Chemical
When O
peroxisomes O
were O
incubated O
with O
[9,10-(3)H]palmitate B-Chemical
and O
[9,10-(3)H]stearate, B-Chemical
among O
medium-chain O
acyl-CoAs, B-Chemical
octanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
and O
decanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
were O
primarily O
detected, O
respectively, O
suggesting O
the O
occurrence O
of O
at O
least O
4 O
cycles O
of O
beta-oxidation O
of O
both O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
by O
peroxisomes. O
