# Abstract
The O
introduction O
of O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
(MS O
MS) O
has O
made O
it O
possible O
to O
screen O
for O
very-long-chain B-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
(VLCAD) B-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
To O
confirm O
the O
diagnosis O
in O
cases O
with O
an O
abnormal O
profile O
of O
blood O
acylcarnitines, B-Chemical
we O
developed O
a O
new O
enzymatic O
assay O
method O
for O
determining O
dehydrogenase O
activity O
toward O
palmitoyl-CoA B-Chemical
(C16:0) B-Chemical
in O
lymphocytes. O
Using O
this O
method, O
the O
production O
of O
2-hexadecenoyl-CoA B-Chemical
(C16:1) B-Chemical
by O
crude O
cell O
lysates O
can O
be O
directly O
quantified O
using O
high O
performance O
liquid O
chromatography O
(HPLC). O
We O
applied O
the O
assay O
to O
7 O
myopathic B-Disease
patients, B-Species
7 O
hypoglycemic B-Disease
patients, B-Species
and O
2 O
presymptomatic O
newborns O
with O
elevated O
levels O
of O
tetradecenoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(C14:1 B-Chemical
AC) I-Chemical
in O
blood, O
and O
found O
impaired O
VLCAD O
activity O
in O
all O
of O
the O
7 O
myopathic B-Disease
patients B-Species
and O
both O
of O
the O
2 O
newborns. O
All O
of O
the O
7 O
hypoglycemic B-Disease
patients B-Species
had O
normal O
level O
of O
the O
enzyme O
activity. O
Results O
of O
the O
ACADVL B-Gene
gene O
analysis O
were O
in O
consistent O
with O
the O
enzymatic O
diagnosis. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
MS O
MS-based O
screening O
for O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
using O
blood O
C14:1 B-Chemical
AC I-Chemical
as O
the O
indicator O
may O
show O
a O
considerably O
high O
false-positive O
rate O
in O
selective O
screening O
of O
symptomatic O
patients. B-Species
Our O
practical O
enzymatic O
assay O
can O
be O
a O
useful O
test O
for O
the O
accurate O
diagnosis O
of O
VLCAD B-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
cases O
screened O
by O
