# Abstract
The O
gut O
microbiota O
is O
well O
known O
to O
affect O
host O
metabolic O
phenotypes. O
The O
systemic O
effects O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
on O
host O
metabolism O
are O
generally O
evaluated O
via O
the O
comparison O
of O
germfree O
and O
conventional O
mice, B-Species
which O
is O
impossible O
to O
perform O
for O
humans. B-Species
Hence, O
it O
remains O
difficult O
to O
determine O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiota O
on O
human B-Species
metabolic O
phenotypes. O
We O
demonstrate O
that O
a O
constraint-based O
modeling O
framework O
that O
simulates O
"germfree" O
and O
"ex-germfree" O
human B-Species
individuals O
can O
partially O
fill O
this O
gap O
and O
allow O
for O
in O
silico O
predictions O
of O
systemic O
human-microbial O
co-metabolism. O
To O
this O
end, O
we O
constructed O
the O
first O
constraint-based O
host-microbial O
community O
model, O
comprising O
the O
most O
comprehensive O
model O
of O
human B-Species
metabolism O
and O
11 O
manually O
curated, O
validated O
metabolic O
models O
of O
commensals, O
probiotics, O
pathogens, O
and O
opportunistic O
pathogens. O
We O
used O
this O
host-microbiota O
model O
to O
predict O
potential O
metabolic O
host-microbe O
interactions O
under O
4 O
in O
silico O
dietary O
regimes. O
Our O
model O
predicts O
that O
gut O
microbes O
secrete O
numerous O
health-relevant O
metabolites O
into O
the O
lumen, O
thereby O
modulating O
the O
molecular O
composition O
of O
the O
body O
fluid O
metabolome. O
Our O
key O
results O
include O
the O
following: O
1. O
Replacing O
a O
commensal O
community O
with O
pathogens O
caused O
a O
loss O
of O
important O
host O
metabolic O
functions. O
2. O
The O
gut O
microbiota O
can O
produce O
important O
precursors O
of O
host O
hormone O
synthesis O
and O
thus O
serves O
as O
an O
endocrine O
organ. O
3. O
The O
synthesis O
of O
important O
neurotransmitters O
is O
elevated O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
gut O
microbiota. O
4. O
Gut O
microbes O
contribute O
essential O
precursors O
for O
glutathione, O
taurine, O
and O
leukotrienes. O
This O
computational O
modeling O
framework O
provides O
novel O
insight O
into O
complex O
metabolic O
host-microbiota O
interactions O
and O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
powerful O
tool O
with O
which O
to O
generate O
novel, O
non-obvious O
hypotheses O
regarding O
host-microbe O
co-metabolism. O
