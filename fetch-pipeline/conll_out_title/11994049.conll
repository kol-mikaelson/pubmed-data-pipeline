# Abstract
The O
final O
two O
enzymes O
in O
the O
CoA B-Chemical
biosynthetic O
pathway, O
phosphopantetheine O
adenylyltransferase O
(PPAT; O
EC O
2.7.7.3) O
and O
dephospho-CoA B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
(DPCK; B-Gene
EC O
2.7.1.24), O
are O
separate O
proteins O
in O
prokaryotes, O
but O
exist O
as O
a O
bifunctional O
enzyme O
in O
pig B-Species
liver. O
In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
have O
obtained O
sequence O
information O
from O
purified O
pig-liver O
enzyme, O
and O
identified O
the O
corresponding O
cDNA O
in O
a O
number O
of O
species. O
The O
human B-Species
gene O
localizes O
to O
chromosome O
17q12-21 O
and O
contains O
regions O
with O
sequence O
similarity O
to O
the O
monofunctional O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
DPCK B-Gene
and O
PPAT. O
The O
recombinant O
564-amino-acid O
human B-Species
protein O
confirmed O
the O
associated O
transferase O
and O
kinase O
activities, O
and O
gave O
similar O
kinetic O

to O
the O
wild-type O
pig B-Species
enzyme. O
