# Abstract
OBJECTIVE: O
To O
review O
the O
cytochrome O
P450 O
system O
and O
associated O
metabolic O
differences O
between O
the O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors. O

SYNTHESIS: O
The O
cytochrome O
P450 O
enzymes, O
which O
can O
be O
divided O
into O
families, O
subfamilies, O
and O
isoenzymes, O
act O
as O
a O
major O
catalyst O
for O
drug O
oxidation O
in O
the O
liver. O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
is O
a O
major O
enzyme, O
accounting O
for O
about O
60% O
of O
drug O
metabolic O
capacity O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
70% O
of O
such O
function O
in O
the O
intestine. O
Lovastatin, B-Chemical
simvastatin, B-Chemical
and O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
are O
substrates O
of O
CYP3A4, B-Gene
whereas O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
is O
metabolized O
by O
CYP2C9. B-Gene
Pravastatin B-Chemical
is O
not O
extensively O
metabolized O
by O
either O
of O
these O
isoenzymes; O
rather, O
it O
is O
transported O
into O
hepatocytes O
by O
a O
sodium-independent, O
carrier-mediated O
uptake O
system O
that O
normally O
transports O
bile B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
Compared O
with O
other O
statins, O
pravastatin B-Chemical
thus O
has O
a O
reduced O
potential O
for O
drug O
interactions O
with O
other O
substrates, O
inhibitors, O
or O
inducers O
of O
the O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
and O
CYP2C9 B-Gene
systems. O
CONCLUSION: O
Pharmacists O
must O
understand O
the O
functions O
of O
these O
enzymes O
to O
identify O
potential O
drug O
interactions, O
especially O
in O
high-risk O
patient B-Species
populations, O
and O
to O
make O
appropriate O
therapeutic O
recommendations O
that O
prevent O
or O
minimize O
adverse O
clinical O
outcomes. O
