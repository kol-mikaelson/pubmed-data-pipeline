# Abstract
Sialic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
participate O
in O
many O
important O
biological O
recognition O
events, O
yet O
eukaryotic O
sialic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
biosynthetic O
genes O
are O
not O
well O
characterized. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
have O
identified O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
gene O
based O
on O
homology O
to O
the O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
sialic B-Gene
acid I-Gene
synthase I-Gene
gene O
(neuB). O
The O
human B-Species
gene O
is O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
and O
encodes O
a O
40-kDa O
enzyme. O
The O
gene O
partially O
restores O

a O
neuB-negative O

the O
human B-Species
