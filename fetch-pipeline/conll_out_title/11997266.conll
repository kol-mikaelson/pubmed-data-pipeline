# Abstract
Although O
the O
reduced O
folate B-Chemical
carrier O
RFC1 B-Gene
and O
the O
thiamine B-Chemical
transporters O
THTR-1 B-Gene
and O
THTR-2 B-Gene
share O
approximately O
40% O
of O
their O
identity O
in O
protein O
sequence, O
RFC1 B-Gene
does O
not O
transport O
thiamine B-Chemical
and O
THTR-1 B-Gene
and O
THTR-2 B-Gene
do O
not O
transport O
folates. B-Chemical
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
transport O
of O
thiamine B-Chemical
monophosphate I-Chemical
(TMP), B-Chemical
an O
important O
thiamine B-Chemical
metabolite O
present O
in O
plasma O
and O
cerebrospinal O
fluid, O
is O
mediated O
by O
RFC1 B-Gene
in O
L1210 B-CellLine
murine B-Species
leukemia I-Species
cells. O
Transport O
of O
TMP B-Chemical
was O
augmented O
by O
a O
factor O
of O
five O
in O
cells O
(R16) B-CellLine
that O
overexpress O
RFC1 B-Gene
and O
was O
markedly O
inhibited O
by O
methotrexate, B-Chemical
an O
RFC1 B-Gene
substrate, O
but O
not O
by O
thiamine. B-Chemical
At O
a O
near-physiological O
concentration O
(50 O
nM), O
TMP B-Chemical
influx O
mediated O
by O
RFC1 B-Gene
in O
wild-type O
L1210 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
approximately O
50% O
of O
thiamine B-Chemical
influx O
mediated O
by O
thiamine B-Chemical
transporter(s). O
Within O
1 O
min, O
the O
majority O
of O
TMP B-Chemical
transported O
into O
R16 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
hydrolyzed O
to O
thiamine B-Chemical
with O
a O
component O
metabolized O
to O
thiamine B-Chemical
pyrophosphate, I-Chemical
the O
active O
enzyme O
cofactor. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
RFC1 B-Gene
may O
be O
one O
of O
the O
alternative O
transport O
routes O
available O
for O
TMP B-Chemical
in O
some O
tissues O
when O
THTR-1 B-Gene
