# Abstract
We O
have O
isolated O
a O
cDNA O
from O
human B-Species
placenta, O
which, O
when O
expressed O
heterologously O
in O
mammalian O
cells, O
mediates O
the O
transport O
of O
the O
water-soluble O
vitamin O
thiamine. B-Chemical
The O
cDNA O
codes O
for O
a O
protein O
of O
497 O
amino O
acids O
containing O
12 O
putative O
transmembrane O
domains. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
indicates O
that O
this O
transporter O
is O
widely O
expressed O
in O
human B-Species
tissues. O
When O
expressed O
in O
HeLa B-CellLine
cells, O
the O
cDNA O
induces O
the O
transport O
of O
thiamine B-Chemical

in O
a O
Na(+)-independent O
manner. O
The O
cDNA-mediated O
transport O
of O
thiamine B-Chemical
is O
stimulated O
by O
an O
outwardly O
directed O
H(+) O
gradient. O
Substrate O
specificity O
assays O
indicate O
that O
the O
transporter O
is O
specific O
to O
thiamine. B-Chemical
Even O
though O
thiamine B-Chemical
is O
an O
organic O
cation, O
the O
cDNA-induced O
thiamine B-Chemical
transport O
is O
not O
inhibited O
by O
other O
organic O
cations. O
Similarly, O
thiamine B-Chemical
is O
not O
a O
substrate O
for O
the O
known O
members O
of O
mammalian O
organic O
cation O
transporter O
family. O
The O
thiamine B-Chemical
transporter O
gene, O
located O
on O
human B-Species
chromosome O
1q24, O
consists O
of O
6 O
exons O
and O
is O
most O
likely O
the O
gene O
defective O
in O
the O
metabolic O
disorder, O
thiamine-responsive O
megaloblastic O
anemia. O
At O
the O
level O
of O
amino O
acid O
sequence, O
the O
thiamine B-Chemical
transporter O
is O
most O
closely O
related O
to O
the O
reduced-folate O
transporter O
and O
thus O
represents O
the O
second O
member O
of O
the O
folate O
transporter O
family. O
