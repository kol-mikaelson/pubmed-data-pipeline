# Abstract
Endothelial O

release O
several O
compounds, O
including O
prostacyclin, B-Chemical
NO, O
and O
endothelium-derived B-Chemical
hyperpolarizing I-Chemical
factor I-Chemical
(EDHF), B-Chemical
that O
mediate O
the O
vascular O
effects O
of O
vasoactive B-Chemical
hormones. I-Chemical
The O
identity O
of O
EDHF B-Chemical
remains O
unknown. O
Since O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
causes O
endothelium-dependent O
relaxations O
of O

through O
its O
metabolism O
to O
epoxyeicosatrienoic B-Chemical

we O
wondered O
if O
the O
EETs B-Chemical
represent O
EDHFs. O
Precontracted O

an O

The O

These O
