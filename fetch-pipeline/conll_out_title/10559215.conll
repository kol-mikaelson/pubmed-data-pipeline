retinaldehyde, B-Chemical
propionaldehyde, B-Chemical

octanaldehyde B-Chemical
from O
four O
human B-Species

were O

The O
tissue O

from O
human B-Species
liver O
and O
kidney O
were O
the O
same, O
indicating O
presence O
of O
the O

enzymes O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
and O
kidney. O
Moreover, O
in O
both O
organs O
the O

NAD(+)-dependent O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical

copurified O
with O
the O
propionaldehyde B-Chemical

octanaldehyde B-Chemical
activities; O
in O
both O
organs O
the O
major O
NAD(+)-dependent O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical
activity O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
E1 O
isozyme O
(coded O
for O
by O
aldh1 B-Gene
gene) O
of O
human B-Species
aldehyde O

A O
small O
amount O
of O
NAD(+)-dependent O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical

was O
associated O
with O
the O
E2 O
isozyme O
(product O

of O

Some O
NAD(+)-independent O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical

in O
both O
organs O
was O
associated O
with O
aldehyde B-Gene

which O
could O
be O
easily O
separated O
from O
dehydrogenases. O
Employing O
cellular B-Gene
retinoid-binding I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(CRBP), B-Gene
purified O
from O
human B-Species
liver, O
demonstrated O
that O
E1 O
isozyme O
(but O
not O
E2 O
isozyme) O
could O
utilize O
CRBP-bound O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical
as O
substrate, O
a O
feature O
thought O
to O
be O
specific O
to O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical
dehydrogenases. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
report O
of O
CRBP-bound O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical
functioning O
as O
substrate O
for O
aldehyde O

of O

Thus, O
it O
is O
concluded O
that O
in O
the O

organism, O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical

(coded O

and O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
E1 O
isozyme O
may O
be O
more O
important O
to O
alcoholism B-Disease
than O
the O
acetaldehyde-metabolizing O
enzyme, O

because O
competition O
between O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical

could O
result O
in O
