# Abstract
We O
subcloned O
human B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
full-length O
cDNAs O
of O
a O
novel O
subtype O
of O
glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate B-Gene
amidotransferase I-Gene
(GFAT), B-Gene
which O
was O
designated O
GFAT2 B-Gene
(the O
previously O
reported O
GFAT B-Gene
was O
named O
GFAT1). B-Gene
Both O

GFAT2 B-Gene
proteins O
deduced O
from O
their O
open O

composed O
of O
682 O

between O
the O
human B-Species
GFAT2 B-Gene
and O
the O

2%, O
respectively. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
using O
probe O
specific O

human B-Species
GFAT1 B-Gene

GFAT2 B-Gene
showed O
that O
major O

in O
both O
the O
human B-Species

subtypes. O
The O

revealed O
different O
tissue O

between O
GFAT1 B-Gene
and O
GFAT2: B-Gene
GFAT1 B-Gene
was O
more O
highly O
expressed O
in O
the O
placenta, O
pancreas, O
and O
testis O
than O
GFAT2; B-Gene
GFAT2 B-Gene
was O
expressed O
throughout O
the O
central O
nervous O
system, O
especially O
in O
the O
spinal O
cord, O
but O
GFAT1 B-Gene
expression O
was O
weak. O
The O
locus O
was O
mapped O
to O
human B-Species
chromosome O
5q O
and O
mouse B-Species
chromosome B-Chromosome

where O
a O
synteny O
between O
