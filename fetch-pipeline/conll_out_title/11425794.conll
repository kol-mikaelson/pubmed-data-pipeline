# Abstract
The O

oligosaccharide B-Chemical
donor O
for O
protein O
N-glycosylation O
in O
eukaryotes, O
Glc3Man9GlcNAc(2)-P-P-dolichol, B-Chemical
is O
synthesized O
in O
two O

on O
both O
leaflets O
of O
the O
rough O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
(ER). O
There O
is O
good O
evidence O
that O
the O
level O

(Dol-P) B-Chemical
is O
one O
rate-controlling O

in O
the O
first O

of O
the O

process. O
In O
the O
current O
topological O

it O
is O
proposed O
that O
ER O
proteins O
(flippases) O
then O
mediate O
the O

of O

The O
