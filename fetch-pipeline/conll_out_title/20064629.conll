# Abstract
Peroxisomes O
play O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
cellular O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism O
as O
exemplified O
by O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
number O
of O
genetic B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
in O
humans B-Species
caused O
by O
the O
impaired O
function O
of O
one O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism. O
Key O
pathways O
in O
which O
peroxisomes O
are O
involved O
include: O
(1.) O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
beta-oxidation; O
(2.) O
etherphospholipid B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
and O
(3.) O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
alpha-oxidation. O
In O
this O
paper O
we O
will O
describe O
these O
different O
pathways O
in O
some O
detail O
and O
will O
provide O
an O
overview O
of O
peroxisomal B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
of O
metabolism O
and O
in O
addition O
discuss O
the O
toxicity O
of O
the O
intermediates O
of O
peroxisomal O
metabolism O
as O
they O
accumulate O
in O
the O
different O
peroxisomal O
deficiencies. O
