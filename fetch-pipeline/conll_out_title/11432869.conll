# Abstract
Glutamate B-Chemical
is O
the O
major O
excitatory O
neurotransmitter O
in O
the O
mammalian O
central O
nervous O
system. O
Packaging O
and O
storage O
of O
glutamate B-Chemical
into O
glutamatergic O
neuronal O
vesicles O
requires O
ATP-dependent O
vesicular O
glutamate B-Chemical
uptake O
systems, O
which O
utilize O
the O
electrochemical O
proton O
gradient O
as O
a O
driving O
force. O
VGLUT1, B-Gene
the O
first O
identified O
vesicular O
glutamate B-Chemical
transporter, O
is O
only O
expressed O
in O
a O
subset O
of O
glutamatergic O
neurons. O
We O
report O
here O
the O
molecular O

and O
functional O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
glutamate B-Chemical
transporter, O
VGLUT2, B-Gene
from O
mouse B-Species
brain. O
VGLUT2 B-Gene
has O
all O
major O
functional O
characteristics O
of O
a O
synaptic O
vesicle O
glutamate B-Chemical
transporter, O
including O
ATP B-Chemical
dependence, O
chloride B-Chemical
stimulation, O
substrate O
specificity, O
and O
substrate O
affinity. O
It O
has O
75 O
and O
79% O
amino O
acid O

with O
human B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
VGLUT1, B-Gene
respectively. O
However, O
expression O
patterns O
of O
VGLUT2 B-Gene
in O
brain O
are O
different O
from O
that O
of O
VGLUT1. B-Gene
In O
addition, O
VGLUT2 B-Gene
activity O
is O
dependent O
on O
both O
membrane O
potential O
and O
pH O
gradient O
of O
the O
electrochemical O
proton O
gradient, O
whereas O
VGLUT1 B-Gene
is O
primarily O
dependent O
on O
only O
membrane O
potential. O
The O
presence O
of O
VGLUT2 B-Gene
in O
brain O
regions O
lacking O
VGLUT1 B-Gene
suggests O
that O
the O
two O
isoforms O
together O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
vesicular O
glutamate B-Chemical
transport O
in O
glutamatergic O
neurons. O
