# Abstract
The O
myriad O
functions O
of O
lipids B-Chemical
as O
signalling O
molecules O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
fields O
in O
contemporary O
pharmacology, O
with O
a O
host O
of O
compounds O
recognized O
as O
mediators O
of O
communication O
within O
and O
between O
cells. O
The O
N-acyl B-Chemical
conjugates I-Chemical
of I-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
neurotransmitters O
(NAANs) B-Chemical
have O
recently O
come O
to O
prominence O
because O
of O
their O
potential O
roles O
in O
the O
nervous O
system, O
vasculature O
and O
the O
immune O
system. O
NAAN B-Chemical
are O
compounds O
such O
as O
glycine, B-Chemical
GABA B-Chemical
or O
dopamine B-Chemical
conjugated O
with O
long B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
More O
than O
70 O
endogenous O
NAAN B-Chemical
have O
been O
reported O
although O
their O
physiological O
role O
remains O
uncertain, O
with O
various O
NAAN B-Chemical
interacting O
with O
a O
low O
affinity O
at O
G B-Gene
protein I-Gene
coupled I-Gene
receptors I-Gene
(GPCR) B-Gene
and O
ion O
channels. O
Regardless O
of O
their O
potential O
physiological O
function, O
NAAN B-Chemical
are O
of O
great O
interest O
to O
pharmacologists O
because O
of O
their O
potential O
as O
flexible O
tools O
to O
probe O
new O
sites O
on O
GPCRs, O
transporters O
and O
ion O
channels. O
NAANs B-Chemical
are O
amphipathic O
molecules, O
with O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
potential O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
headgroup O
moieties, O
a O
combination O
which O
provides O
a O
rich O
source O
of O
potential O
ligands O
engaging O
novel O
binding O
sites O
and O
mechanisms O
for O
modulation O
of O
membrane O
proteins O
such O
as O
GPCRs, O
ion O
channels O
and O
transporters. O
The O
unique O
actions O
of O
subsets O
of O
NAAN B-Chemical
on O
voltage-gated O
calcium O
channels O
and O
glycine B-Chemical
transporters O
indicate O
that O
the O
wide O
variety O
of O
NAAN B-Chemical
may O
provide O
a O
readily O
exploitable O
resource O
for O
defining O
new O
pharmacological O
targets. O
Investigation O
of O
the O
physiological O
roles O
and O
pharmacological O
potential O
of O
these O
simple O
lipid O
conjugates O
is O
in O
its O
infancy, O
and O
we O
believe O
that O
there O
is O
much O
to O
be O
learnt O
from O
their O
careful O
study. O
