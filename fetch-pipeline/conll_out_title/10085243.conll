# Abstract
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
(GPI) B-Chemical
is O
used O
as O
a O
membrane O
anchor O
by O
many O
eukaryotic O
cell-surface O
proteins. O
The O
second O
step O
of O
GPI B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
is O
de-N-acetylation O
of O
N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
(GlcNAc-PI). B-Chemical
We O
have O

Here O
we O
show O
that O
recombinant O

The O

These O
results O
indicate O
that O
GlcNAc-PI B-Chemical
de-N-acetylase O
is O
conserved O
between O
mammals O
and O
yeasts B-Species
and O
that O
the O

is O
also O
indispensable O
in O
yeasts. B-Species
