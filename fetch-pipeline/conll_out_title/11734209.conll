# Abstract
Yeast B-Species
co-expressing O
human B-Species
elongase O
and O
desaturase O
genes O
were O
used O
to O
investigate O
whether O
the O
same O
desaturase O
gene O
encodes O
an O
enzyme O
able O
to O
desaturate O
n-3 B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
n-6 I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
with O
the O
same O
or O
different O
carbon B-Chemical

length. O
The O
results O
clearly O
demonstrated O
that O
a O
single O
human B-Species
Delta5 B-Gene
desaturase I-Gene
is O
active O
on O
20:3n-6 B-Chemical
and O
20:4n-3. O
Endogenous O
Delta6 B-Gene
desaturase I-Gene
substrates O
were O
generated O
by O
providing O
to O
the O
yeast B-Species
radiolabelled O
20:4n-6 O
or O
20:5n-3 O
which, O
through O
two O
sequential O
elongations, O
produced O
24:4n-6 B-Chemical
and O
24:5n-3, B-Chemical
respectively. O
Overall, O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
a O
single O
human B-Species
Delta6 B-Gene
desaturase I-Gene
is O
active O
