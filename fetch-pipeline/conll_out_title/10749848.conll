# Abstract
Unconjugated O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
must O
be O
activated O
to O
their O
CoA B-Chemical
thioesters I-Chemical
before O
conjugation O

taurine B-Chemical
or O
glycine B-Chemical
can O
occur. O
A O
human B-Species
homolog O
of O
very B-Gene
long-chain I-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
synthetase, I-Gene
hVLCS-H2, O
has O
two O
requisite O
properties O
of O
a O
bile O
acid:CoA O
ligase, O
liver O
specificity O
and O
an O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
subcellular O
localization. O
We O
investigated O
the O
ability O
of O
this O
enzyme O
to O
activate O
the O
primary O
bile B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
cholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
to O
its O
CoA B-Chemical
derivative. O
When O
expressed O
in O
COS-1 B-CellLine
cells, O
hVLCS-H2 O
exhibited O
cholate:CoA B-Gene
ligase I-Gene
(choloyl-CoA O
synthetase) O
activity O
with O
both O
non-isotopic O
and O
radioactive O
assays. O
Other O
long- B-Gene
and I-Gene
very I-Gene
long-chain I-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
synthetases I-Gene
were O
incapable O
of O
activating O
cholate. B-Chemical
Endogenous O
choloyl-CoA O
synthetase O
activity O
was O
also O
detected O
in O
liver-derived O
HepG2 B-CellLine
cells O
but O
not O
in O
kidney-derived O
COS-1 B-CellLine
cells. O
Our O
results O
are O
consistent O
with O
a O
role O
for O
hVLCS-H2 O
in O
the O
re-activation O
and O
re-conjugation O
