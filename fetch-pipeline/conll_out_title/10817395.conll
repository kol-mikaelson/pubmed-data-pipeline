# Abstract
In O
human B-Species
liver O
homogenate O
the O
formation O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acid-CoA I-Chemical
thioesters I-Chemical
is O
localized O
both O
to O
the O
microsomal O
fraction O
catalysed O
by O
an O
ATP-dependent O
synthetase O
and O
to O
the O
peroxisomal O
fraction O
catalysed O
by O
the O
thiolase O
in O
the O
last O
step O
of O
the O
beta-oxidative O
cleavage O
of O
the O
5beta-cholestanoyl O
side O
chain. O
The O

acid-CoA:amino I-Gene

N-acyltransferase I-Gene
catalyse O
the O

of O

CoA-activated O
bile B-Chemical

with O
taurine B-Chemical
or O
glycine B-Chemical
prior O
to O
secretion O
into O
bile. O
The O
formation O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acid-CoA I-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
is O
considered O
the O
rate-limiting O
step O
in O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
amidation. O
So O
far, O
a O
bile B-Chemical
acid-CoA I-Chemical
cleaving O
activity O
has O
not O
been O
assessed O
in O
the O
research O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
amidation O
in O
human B-Species
liver. O
In O
this O
work, O
a O
bile B-Chemical
acid-CoA I-Chemical
cleaving O
activity O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
at O
a O
rate O
that O
may O
influence O
the O
concentration O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acid-CoA I-Chemical
thioesters, I-Chemical
free O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
amidated O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
within O
the O
hepatocyte. O
Recently, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O
free O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
formed O
by O
the O
thioesterase, O
is O
the O
physiological O
ligand O
of O
the O
farnesoid O
X O
receptor. O
A O
multiorganelle O
distribution O
of O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acid-CoA I-Chemical
hydrolytic O
activity O
was O
found. O
In O
the O
postnuclear O
fraction O
of O
human B-Species
liver O
homogenate, O
apparent O
Km O
and O
Vmax O
for O
the O
cleavage O
of O
choloyl-CoA B-Chemical
were O
7.7 O
x O
10-5 O
mol O
L O
and O
3.6 O
nmol O
x O
mg-1 O
x O
min-1 O
respectively. O
The O
corresponding O
values O
for O
chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA B-Chemical
cleavage O
were O
7.1 O
x O
10-5 O
mol O
L O
and O
4.8 O
nmol O
x O
mg-1 O
x O
min-1. O
Hydrolytic O
activities O
were O
detected O
in O
the O
microsomal O
and O
the O
peroxisomal O
fractions O
where O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acid-CoA I-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
are O
formed O
as O
well O
as O
in O
cytosol O
housing O
the O
N-acyltransferase O
activity. O
Compared O
to O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acid-CoA I-Chemical
synthetase O
activities, O
the O
hydrolytic O
activities O
were O
considerably O
higher, O
both O
in O
the O
postnuclear O
fraction O
and O
in O
the O
microsomal O
fraction. O
The O
thioesterase O
activities O
were O
in O
the O
same O
range O
as O
detected O
for O
the O
N-acyltransferase O
activities O
both O
in O
the O
postnuclear O
fraction O
and O
in O
the O
cytosolic O
fraction. O
The O
mere O
presence O
of O
thioesterase O
in O
microsomes, O
peroxisomes O
and O
cytosol O
seems O
counterproductive O
to O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
amidation. O
The O
thioesterases O
may O
have O
an O
indirect O
regulatory O
function O
on O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthesis O
and O
are O
important O
for O
the O
regulation O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthesis O
by O
providing O
free O
chenodeoxycholic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
the O
most O
potent O
activator O
of O
the O
farnesoid O
