# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Dietary O
behenic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(22:0) O
is O
poorly O
absorbed. O
Because O
of O
its O
low O
bioavailability O
compared O
with O
other O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
because O
of O
its O
very O
long O

length, O
the O
effect O
of O
dietary O
behenic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(behenate) B-Chemical
on O

assumed O
to O
be O
neutral. O
OBJECTIVE: O
The O
objective O
was O
to O
establish O
the O
cholesterol-raising O
potential O
of O
behenic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
by O
comparing O
the O
effects O
on O
lipid B-Chemical
and O
lipoprotein O
concentrations O
of O
a O
specially O
formulated O
fat O
enriched O
with O
behenic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
with O
those O
of O
palm B-Chemical
oil I-Chemical
(rich O
in O
palmitic B-Chemical
acid; I-Chemical
16:0) O
and O
high-oleic O
acid O
sunflower O
oil O
(rich O
in O
cis B-Chemical
oleic B-Chemical
acid; I-Chemical

DESIGN: O
In O
a O
randomized, O
crossover, O
metabolic-ward O
study, O
7 O
mildly O
hypercholesterolemic B-Disease
men B-Species
were O
fed O
3 O
natural-food O
diets O
supplemented O
with O
behenate B-Chemical
oil, I-Chemical
palm B-Chemical
oil, I-Chemical
or O
high-oleic O

sunflower O
oil. O
Mean O
serum O

lipoprotein O
concentrations O
and O
plasma O
triacylglycerol B-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical

composition O
were O
determined O
from O

period. O
RESULTS: O
Behenate B-Chemical
oil I-Chemical
produced O
mean O

of O
total O

palm B-Chemical
oil I-Chemical
(5.84+ O
-0.7 O
and O
4.42+ O
-0.7 O
mmol O

respectively) O
but O
significantly O
higher O

those O
produced O
by O
high-oleic O

sunflower O
oil O
(5.12+ O
-0.5 O

There O
were O
no O
significant O

concentrations. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Despite O
its O
low O
bioavailability O
compared O
with O
oleic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
behenic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
a O
cholesterol-raising O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
in O
humans B-Species
and O
is O
therefore O
not O
a O
