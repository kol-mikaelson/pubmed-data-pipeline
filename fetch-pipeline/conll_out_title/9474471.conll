# Abstract
The O
new O
loop O
diuretic O
torasemide B-Chemical
belongs O
to O
the O
pyridine B-Chemical
sulfonylurea I-Chemical
class. O
It O
is O
well O
absorbed O
and O
yields O
a O
bioavailablity O
of O
about O
80% O
in O
healthy O
individuals, O
even O
higher O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
oedema. B-Disease
This O
is O
roughly O
double O
that O
of O
the O
'classical' O
loop O
diuretic O
furosemide B-Chemical
(frusemide) B-Chemical
[26 O
to O
65%]. O
Torasemide B-Chemical
is O
highly O
bound O
to O
protein O
(99%) O
as O
is O
furosemide. B-Chemical
The O
volume O
of O
distribution O
of O
torasemide B-Chemical
was O
determined O
as O
0.2 O
L O
kg O
as O
compared O
with O
0.11 O
to O
0.18 O
L O
kg O
for O
furosemide. B-Chemical
Torasemide B-Chemical
undergoes O
extensive O
hepatic O
metabolism; O
only O
20% O
of O
the O
parent O
drug O
is O
recovered O
unchanged O
in O
the O
urine. O
For O
comparison O
only O
10 O
to O
20% O
of O
furosemide B-Chemical
undergoes O
phase O
II O
metabolisation O
(to O
the O
glucuronide). B-Chemical
In O
chronic B-Disease
renal I-Disease
failure I-Disease
the O
renal O
clearance O
of O
torasemide B-Chemical
decreased O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
decrease O
of O
the O
patients' B-Species
glomerular O
filtration O
rate, O
whereas O
the O
total O
plasma O
clearance O
(3 O
times O
that O
of O
the O
renal O
clearance) O
appeared O
to O
be O
independent O
of O
renal O
function. O
As O
expected, O
the O
renal O
excretion O
of O
torasemide B-Chemical
metabolites O
is O
significantly O
retarded O
in O
renal B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
The O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
torasemide B-Chemical
are O
significantly O
influenced O
by O
liver B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
Total O
plasma O
clearance O
of O
torasemide B-Chemical
was O
reduced O
to O
about O
half O
of O
that O
found O
in O
the O
control O
group, O
yielding O
an O
increase O
in O
elimination O
half-life. O
A O
greater O
than O
normal O
fraction O
of O
torasemide B-Chemical
was O
recovered O
in O
the O
urine O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
cirrhosis. B-Disease
In O
contrast, O
the O
kinetics O
of O
furosemide B-Chemical
appeared O
to O
depend O
more O
on O
kidney O
function O
than O
on O
liver B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
The O
pharmacodynamics O
of O
torasemide B-Chemical
are O
principally O
the O
same O
as O
those O
reported O
from O
conventional O
loop O
diuretics O
due O
to O
their O
interference O
with O
one O
binding O
site O
in O
the O
thick O
ascending O
limb O
of O
Henle's O
loop, O
the O
Na+:K+:2Cl- O
carrier. O
The O
maximum O
natriuretic O
effect O
of O
all O
loop O
diuretics O
amounts O
to O
about O
3 O
mmol O
Na+ O
min. O
Members O
of O
this O
class O
differ, O
however, O
with O
respect O
to O
their O
intravenous O
potency O
or O
affinity O
for O
the O
receptor, O
respectively: O
bumetanide B-Chemical
> O
piretanide B-Chemical
> O
torasemide B-Chemical
> O
furosemide. B-Chemical
So O
far, O
the O
only O
loop O
diuretic O
which O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
effectively O
lower O
high O
blood O
pressure O
is O
torasemide. B-Chemical
This O
effect O
occurs O
at O
the O
low O
dose O
of O
2.5 O
mg O
day. O
