# Abstract
Oleate B-Chemical
stimulates O
glucose B-Chemical
production O
and O
concomitantly O
decreases O
lactate B-Chemical
and O
pyruvate B-Chemical
production O
by O
rat B-Species
hepatocyte O
suspensions O
incubated O
with O
dihydroxyacetone B-Chemical
as O
substrate. O
The O
actions O
of O
oleate B-Chemical
could O
be O
blocked O
by O
D-(+)dodecanoylcarnitine, B-Chemical
which O
inhibits O
transport O
of O
the O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
into O
the O
mitochondria O
and O
the O
subsequent O
oxidation. O
beta-Hydroxybutyrate, B-Chemical
but O
not O
acetoacetate, B-Chemical
also O
stimulated O
glucose B-Chemical
synthesis O
and O
inhibited O
lactate B-Chemical
and O
pyruvate B-Chemical
production. O
Furthermore, O
both O
beta-hydroxybutyrate B-Chemical
and O
oleate B-Chemical
stimulated O
oxygen B-Chemical
consumption O
to O
the O
same O
extent. O
This O
suggests O
that O
oleate B-Chemical
stimulates O
glucose B-Chemical
production O
by O
the O
provision O
of O
energy O
subsequent O
to O
mitochondrial O
beta-oxidation O
of O
the O
fatty B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
The O
content O
of O
ATP B-Chemical
itself O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
effects O
of O
oleate. B-Chemical
Crossover O
analysis O
of O
the O
gluconeogenic O

implicated O
a O
site O
of O
oleate B-Chemical
action O
between O
fructose B-Chemical
1,6-bisphosphate I-Chemical
and O
fructose B-Chemical
6-phosphate, I-Chemical
suggesting O
phosphofructokinase O
and O
or O
fructose-bisphosphatase O
as O
possible O
regulatory O
sites. O
Coupled O
with O
the O
finding O
that O
intracellular O
citrate B-Chemical
accumulates O
upon O
addition O
of O
oleate B-Chemical
or O
beta-hydroxybutyrate, B-Chemical
but O
not O
acetoacetate, B-Chemical
the O
results O
suggest O
that O
citrate B-Chemical
inhibition O
of O
phosphofructokinase O
accounts O
for O
the O
redirection O
of O
carbon B-Chemical
flow O
from O
lactate B-Chemical
and O
pyruvate B-Chemical
formation O
and O
towards O
that O

glucose. B-Chemical
