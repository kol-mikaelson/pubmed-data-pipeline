# Abstract
Lysosomal O
enzymes O
sialidase O
(alpha-neuraminidase), O
beta-galactosidase, B-Gene
and O
N-acetylaminogalacto-6-sulfate O
sulfatase O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
catabolism O
of O
glycolipids, B-Chemical
glycoproteins, O
and O
oligosaccharides. B-Chemical
Their O
functional O

in O
the O
cell O
depends O
on O
their O
association O
in O
a O
multienzyme O
complex O

lysosomal O
carboxypeptidase, O
cathepsin B-Gene
A. I-Gene
We O
review O
the O

that O
the O
integrity O
of O
the O
complex O
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
at O
different O
stages O
of O
biogenesis O
of O
lysosomal O
enzymes, O
including O
intracellular O
sorting O
and O
proteolytic O
processing O
of O
their O
precursors. O
The O
complex O
plays O
a O
protective O
role O
for O
all O
components, O
extending O
their O
half-life O
in O
the O
lysosome O

and O
for O
sialidase, O
the O
