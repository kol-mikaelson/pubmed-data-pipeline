# Abstract
Catabolism O
of O
alpha-ketoisocaproate B-Chemical
in O
liver O
is O
mediated O
by O
cytosolic O
alpha-ketoisocaproate B-Chemical
dioxygenase O
(KICD) O
and O
mitochondrial O
branched-chain B-Gene
alpha-keto I-Gene
acid I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
complex I-Gene
(BCKDC). B-Gene
The O
latter O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
main O
pathway O
of O
the O
KIC B-Chemical
catabolism. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
measured O
the O
activities O
of O
KICD O
and O
BCKDC B-Gene
in O
human B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
livers. O
The O
KICD O
activity O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
was O
0.9 O
mU O
g O
tissue, O
which O
was O
14.2% O
of O
the O
total O
activity O
of O
BCKDC, B-Gene
and O
that O
in O
rat B-Species
liver O
was O
4.2 O
mU O
g O
tissue, O
which O
was O
only O
1.0% O
of O
the O
total O
activity, O
suggesting O
that O
KICD O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
plays O
a O
relatively O
important O
role O
in O
the O
alpha-ketoisocaproate B-Chemical
catabolism. O
The O
KICD O
activity O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
was O
significantly O
increased O
by O
cirrhosis. B-Disease
In O
rat B-Species
liver, O
the O
enzyme O
activity O
was O
markedly O
increased O
by O
physical O
training O
and O
streptozotocin-induced O
diabetes, B-Disease
but O
not O
by O
feeding O
of O
a O
diet O
rich O
in O
branched-chain O
amino O
acids, O
although O
BCKDC B-Gene
activity O
was O
increased O
by O
feeding O
of O
the O
diet. O
