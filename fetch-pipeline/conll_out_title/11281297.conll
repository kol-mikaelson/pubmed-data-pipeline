# Abstract
The O
heme B-Chemical
biosynthetic O
and O
catabolic O
pathways O
generate O
pro- O
and O
antioxidant O
compounds, O
and O
consequently, O
influence O
cellular O
sensitivity O
to O
oxidants. O
Heme B-Chemical
precursors O
(delta-aminolevulinic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
porphyrins) B-Chemical
generate O
reactive B-Chemical
oxygen B-Chemical
species I-Chemical
(ROS), B-Chemical
from O
autoxidation O
and O
photochemical O
reactions, O
respectively. O
Heme, B-Chemical
an O
essential O
iron B-Chemical
chelate, O
serves O
in O
respiration, O
oxygen B-Chemical
transport, O
detoxification, O
and O
signal O
transduction O
processes. O
The O
potential O
toxicity B-Disease
of O
heme B-Chemical
and O
hemoproteins O
points O
to O
a O
critical O
role O
for O
heme B-Chemical
degradation O
in O
cellular O
metabolism. O
The O
heme B-Chemical
oxygenases O
(HOs) O
provide O
this O
function O
and O
participate O
in O
cellular O
defense. O
This O
hypothesis O
emerges O
from O
the O
observation O
that O
the O
activation O
of O
HO-1 B-Gene
is O
an O
ubiquitous O
cellular O
response O
to O
oxidative O
stress. O
The O
reaction O
products O
of O
HO B-Disease
activity, O
biliverdin, B-Chemical
and O
its O
subsequent O
metabolite O
bilirubin, B-Chemical
have O
antioxidant O
properties. O
Furthermore, O
iron B-Chemical
released O
from O
HO B-Disease
activity O
stimulates O
ferritin O
synthesis, O
which O
ultimately O
provides O
an O
iron B-Chemical
detoxification O
mechanism O
that O
may O
account O
for O
long-term O
cytoprotection O
observed O
after O
HO B-Disease
induction. O
However, O
such O
models O
have O
overlooked O
potential O
pro-oxidant O
consequences O
of O
HO B-Disease
activity. O
The O
HO B-Disease
reaction O
releases O
iron, B-Chemical
which O
could O
be O
involved O
in O
deleterious O
reactions O
that O
compete O
with O
iron B-Chemical
reutilization O
and O
sequestration O
pathways. O
Indeed, O
the O
induction O
of O
HO B-Disease
activity O
may O
have O
both O
pro- O
and O
antioxidant O
sequelae O
depending O
on O
cellular O
redox O
potential, O
and O
the O
metabolic O
fate O
of O
the O
heme B-Chemical
iron. I-Chemical
