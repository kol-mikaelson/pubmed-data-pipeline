# Abstract
There O
is O
an O
autocrine O

between O
eicosanoid B-Chemical

cytokine O

with O
the O

of O
prostaglandin B-Chemical
E2 I-Chemical
(PGE2) B-Chemical

A2 I-Chemical
(TXA2) B-Chemical
being O
one O
of O
the O
determinants O
of O
the O
level O
of O
cytokine O

In O
monocytes, O
cyclooxygenase O
type O

(COX-1) O
activity O
appears O
to O
favor O
TXA2 B-Chemical
production O
and O
COX-2 B-Gene
activity O
appears O
to O
favor O
PGE2 B-Chemical
production. O
This O
has O
led O
to O
speculation O
regarding O
possible O
linkage O
of O
COX O
isozymes O
with O
PGE B-Chemical
and O
TXA B-Gene

We O
have O
studied O
the O
kinetics O
of O
PGE2 B-Chemical
and O
TXA2 B-Chemical
synthesis O
under O
conditions O
that O
rely O
on O
COX-1 B-Gene
or I-Gene
-2 I-Gene
activity. O
With O
small O

endogenously O
generated O
prostaglandin B-Chemical
H2 I-Chemical
(PGH2), B-Chemical
TXA2 B-Chemical
synthesis O
was O
greater O

PGE2. B-Chemical
With O

PGH2, B-Chemical
PGE2 B-Chemical
synthesis O
was O
greater O

TXA2. B-Chemical
Also, O
TXA B-Gene
synthase I-Gene
was O
saturated O
at O
lower O
substrate O
concentrations O
than O
PGE B-Chemical
synthase. O
This O
pattern O
was O
observed O
irrespective O
of O
whether O
PGH2 B-Chemical
was O
produced O
by O
COX-1 O
or O
COX-2 B-Gene
or O
whether O
it O

Furthermore, O

inhibitor O
SKF86002 B-Chemical
was O
greater O
for O
PGE2 B-Chemical

for O
TXA2. B-Chemical
It O
is O
proposed O
that O
different O
kinetics O
of O
PGE B-Chemical

TXA B-Gene

account O

These O
