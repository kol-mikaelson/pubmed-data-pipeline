# Abstract
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase O
(UGT) O
enzymes O
catalyze O
the O
transfer O
of O
the O
glucuronide B-Chemical
group O
from O
UDP-glucuronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
several O
exogenous O
or O
endogenous O
compounds, O
including O
steroid B-Chemical
hormones. I-Chemical
Although O
it O
is O
widely O
recognized O
that O
the O
liver O
is O
a O
major O
site O
of O
steroid B-Chemical
glucuronidation, O
RT-PCR O
analysis O
has O
shown O
the O
expression O
of O
UGT2B O
transcripts O
in O
extrahepatic O
steroid B-Chemical
target O
tissues O
such O
as O
the O
prostate. O
Measurement O
of O
androgen O
metabolites O
in O
human B-Species
prostate O
revealed O
high O
levels O
of O
C(19) B-Chemical
steroid I-Chemical
glucuronides I-Chemical
such O
as O
androsterone B-Chemical
glucuronide I-Chemical
and O
3alpha-diol B-Chemical
glucuronide, I-Chemical
thus O
suggesting O
an O
important O
role O
of O
UGT2B O
enzymes O
in O
androgen O
metabolism. O
To O
investigate O
the O
cellular O
localization O
of O
UGT2B O
expression O
in O
the O
human B-Species
prostate, O
the O
present O
in O
situ O
hybridization O
studies O
demonstrated O
the O
presence O
of O
UGT2B O
transcripts O
in O
epithelial O
cells O
lining O
the O
acinii. O
All O
basal O
cells O
were O
intensively O
labeled, O
whereas O
the O
luminal O
secretory O
cells O
were O
moderately O
labeled. O
To O
confirm O
these O
results, O
an O
immunohistological O
analysis O
was O
performed O
using O
a O
specific O
anti-UGT2B O
antibody. O
The O
presence O
of O
UGT2B O
proteins O
was O
observed O
in O
both O
basal O
and O
luminal O
cells O
of O
prostate O
epithelium, O
in O
fibrocytes O
of O
stroma O
and O
blood O
vessels, O
and O
in O
endothelial O
cells O
of O
blood O
vessels. O
Using O
a O
specific O
anti-UGT2B17 O
antibody, O
the O
expression O
of O
this O
androsterone-conjugating O
UGT O
enzyme O
was O
found O
exclusively O
in O
basal O
cells O
of O
the O
epithelium. O
These O
results O
demonstrate O
the O
expression O
of O
androgen-conjugating O
UGT2B O
enzymes O
in O
human B-Species
prostatic O
epithelium. O
Moreover, O
they O
show O
for O
the O
first O
time O
a O
cell O
type-specific O
expression O
of O
an O
UGT2B O
isoform. O
