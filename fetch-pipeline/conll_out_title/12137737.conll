# Abstract
The O
process O
of O
N-linked O
glycosylation O
of O
secretory O
proteins O
is O
characterized O
by O
enzymatic O
reactions O
occurring O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
(ER) O
membrane. O
On O
either O
side O
multiple O
glycosyltransferases O
participate O
in O
the O
stepwise O
addition O
of O
monosaccharides B-Chemical
to O
core O
oligosaccharide B-Chemical
unit O
that O
is O
attached O
to O
the O
lipid B-Chemical
carrier O
dolichyl B-Chemical
pyrophosphate. I-Chemical
Cytoplasm-oriented O
glycosyltransferases O
use O
nucleotide-activated O
sugars B-Chemical
as O
substrates, O
whereas O
lumen-oriented O
transferases O
that O
act O
later O
in O
the O
pathway O
make O
use O
of O
dolichyl O
phosphate-linked O
monosaccharides. B-Chemical
The O
completely O
assembled O
core O
oligosaccharide B-Chemical
is O
transferred O
to O
proteins O
on O
the O
lumenal O
side O
of O
the O
ER. O
The O
topological O
organization O
of O
this O
biosynthetic O
pathway O
requires O
the O
translocation O
of O
lipid-linked B-Chemical
mono- I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
oligo-saccharides I-Chemical
across O
the O
ER O
membrane. O
The O
transfer O
of O
the O
substrates O
and O
intermediates O
depend O
on O
specific O
translocators, O
i.e. O
so O
called O
flippases. O
