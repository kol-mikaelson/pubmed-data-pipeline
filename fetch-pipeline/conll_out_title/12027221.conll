Bicarbonate B-Chemical
transporter O
polypeptides O
are O
encoded O
by O
at O
least O
two O
gene O
families, O
SLC4 O
and O
SLC26. O
The O
SLC4 O
gene O
family O
includes O
at O
least O
three O
Na()+)-independent O
chloride-bicarbonate O
exchanger O
genes O
and O
multiple O
Na(+)-bicarbonate O
cotransporter O
and O
Na(+)-dependent O
anion O
exchanger O
genes. O
The O
most O
extensively O
studied O
among O
them O
are O
the O
Na(+)-independent O
anion O
exchangers, O
AE1, B-Gene
AE2, B-Gene
and O
AE3, B-Gene
all O
of O
which O
are O
expressed O
in O

The O
AE1 B-Gene
gene O
encodes O
eAE1 O

AE2 B-Gene
can O
also O
be O

by O
ammonium B-Chemical

are O
not O

by O
the O

Structure-function O
studies O
of O
recombinant O
proteins O
involving O
chimeras, O

have O
delineated O
regions O
of O
AE2 B-Gene
which O
are O
important O
in O

These O
include O
regions O
of O
the O
transmembrane O
