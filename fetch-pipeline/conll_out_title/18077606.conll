# Abstract
The O
expression O
pattern O
of O
the O
electroneutral O
Na(+)-HCO(3)(-)cotransporter O
NBCn1 B-Gene
(slc4a7) B-Gene
was O
investigated O
by O
beta-galactosidase B-Gene
staining O
of O
mice B-Species
with O
a O
LacZ O
insertion O
into O
the O
NBCn1 B-Gene
gene. O
This O
method O
is O
of O
particular O
value O
because O
it O
is O
independent O
of O
immunoreactivity. O
We O
find O
that O
the O
NBCn1 B-Gene
promoter O
is O
active O
in O
a O
number O
of O
tissues O
where O
NBCn1 B-Gene
has O
previously O
been O
functionally O
or O
immunohistochemically O
identified, O
including O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
blood O
vessels O
(vascular O
smooth O
muscle O
cells O
and O
endothelial O
cells), O
kidney O
thick O
ascending O
limb O
and O
medullary O
collecting O
duct O
epithelial O
cells, O
the O
epithelial O
lining O
of O
the O
kidney O
pelvis, O
duodenal O
enterocytes, O
choroid O
plexus O
epithelial O
cells, O
hippocampus, O
and O
retina. O
Kidney O
corpuscles, O
colonic O
mucosa, O
and O
nonvascular O
smooth O
muscle O
cells O
(from O
the O
urinary O
bladder, O
trachea, O
gastrointestinal O
wall, O
and O
uterus) O
were O
novel O
areas O
of O
promoter O
activity. O
Atrial O
but O
not O
ventricular O
cardiomyocytes O
were O
stained. O
In O
the O
brain, O
distinct O
layers O
of O
the O
cerebral O
cortex O
and O
cerebellar O
Purkinje O
cells O
were O
stained O
as O
was O
the O
dentate O
nucleus. O
No O
staining O
of O
skeletal O
muscle O
or O
cortical O
collecting O
ducts O
was O
observed. O
RT-PCR O
analyses O
confirmed O
the O
expression O
of O
NBCn1 B-Gene
and O
beta-galactosidase B-Gene
in O
selected O
tissues. O
Disruption O
of O
the O
NBCn1 B-Gene
gene O
resulted O
in O
reduced O
NBCn1 B-Gene
expression, O
and O
in O
bladder O
smooth O
muscle O
cells, O
reduced O
amiloride-insensitive O
Na(+)-dependent O
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical
influx O
was O
observed. O
Furthermore, O
disruption O
of O
the O
NBCn1 B-Gene
gene O
resulted O
in O
a O
lower O
intracellular O
steady-state O
pH O
of O
bladder O
smooth O
muscle O
cells O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
CO(2) B-Chemical
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical
but O
not O
in O
its O
nominal O
absence. O
We O
conclude O
that O
NBCn1 B-Gene
has O
a O
broad O
expression O
profile, O
supporting O
previous O
findings O
based O
on O
immunoreactivity, O
and O
suggest O
several O
new O
tissues O
where O
NBCn1 B-Gene
may O
be O
important. O
