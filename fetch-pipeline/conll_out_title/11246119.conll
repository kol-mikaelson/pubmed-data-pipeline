# Abstract
Epidemiological O

Not O

In O
this O
work, O
we O
explore O
the O
possibility O
that O
alcohol B-Chemical
were O
activated O
to O
acetaldehyde B-Chemical

free B-Chemical
radicals I-Chemical
in O

However, O
hydroxylated O

suggesting O
either O
that O

that O

No O

such O

Results O
suggest O
that O
bioactivation O

a O
carcinogen, O
such O

acetaldehyde, B-Chemical

potentially O

This O
