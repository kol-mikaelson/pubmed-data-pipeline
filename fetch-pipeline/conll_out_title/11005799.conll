# Abstract
Arylamine O
N:-acetyltransferase O
(NAT) B-Gene
was O
first O
identified O
as O
the O
inactivator O
of O
the O
anti-tubercular O
drug O
isoniazid. B-Chemical
The O
enzyme O
was O
shown O
to O
catalyse O
the O
transfer O
of O
an O
acetyl O
group O
from O
acetyl-CoA B-Chemical
to O
the O
terminal O
nitrogen B-Chemical
of O
the O
hydrazine B-Chemical
drug. O
The O
rate O
of O
inactivation O
of O
isoniazid B-Chemical
was O
polymorphically O
distributed O
in O
the O
population O
and O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
examples O
of O
pharmacogenetic O
variation. O
NAT B-Gene
was O
identified O
recently O
in O
Mycobacterium B-Species
tuberculosis I-Species
and O
is O
a O
candidate O
for O
modulating O
the O
response O
to O
isoniazid. B-Chemical
Genome O
sequences O
have O
revealed O
many O
homologous O
members O
of O
this O
unique O
family O
of O
enzymes. O
The O
first O
three-dimensional O
structure O
of O
a O
member O
of O
the O
NAT B-Gene
family O
identifies O
a O
catalytic O
triad O
consisting O
of O
aspartate, O
histidine B-Chemical
and O
cysteine O
proposed O
to O
form O
the O
activation O
mechanism. O
So O
far, O
all O
procaryotic O
NATs O
resemble O
the O
human B-Species
enzyme O
which O
acetylates O
isoniazid B-Chemical
(NAT2). B-Gene
Human B-Species
NAT2 B-Gene
is O
characteristic O
of O
drug-metabolizing O
enzymes: O
it O
is O
found O
in O
liver O
and O
intestine. O
In O
humans B-Species
and O
other O
mammals, O
there O
are O
up O
to O
three O
different O
isoenzymes. O
If O
only O
one O
isoenzyme O
is O
present, O
it O
is O
like O
human B-Species
NAT1. B-Gene
Human B-Species
NAT1 B-Gene
and O
its O
murine B-Species
equivalent O
specifically O
acetylate O
the O
folate B-Chemical
catabolite O
p-aminobenzoylglutamate. B-Chemical
NAT1 B-Gene
and O
its O
murine B-Species
homologue O
each O
have O
a O
ubiquitous O
tissue O
distribution O
and O
are O
expressed O
early O
in O
development O
at O
the O
blastocyst O
stage. O
During O
murine B-Species
embryonic O
development, O
NAT B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
the O
developing O
neural O
tube. O
The O
proposed O
endogenous O
role O
of O
NAT B-Gene
in O
folate B-Chemical
metabolism, O
and O
its O
multi-allelic O
nature, O
indicate O
that O
its O
role O
in O
development O
should O
be O
assessed O
further. O
