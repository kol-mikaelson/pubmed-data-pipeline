# Abstract
Amino O
acid O
transporters O
are O
proteins O
that O
transport O
amino O
acids O
across O
the O
membrane. O
We O
report O
here O
the O
isolation O
and O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
cDNA O
clone O
encoding O
a O
protein O
of O
547 O
amino O
acids. O
This O
protein O
shares O
approximately O
50% O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
homology O
with O
the O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
mouse B-Species
mNAT B-Gene
and O
its O
orthologs, O
rat B-Species
SN1 B-Gene
and O
human B-Species
g17, B-Gene
and O
mouse B-Species
GlnT O
ATA1 O
and O
ATA2. B-Gene
Expression O
of O
this O
cRNA O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
oocytes O
revealed O
that O
the O
strongest O
transport O
activities O
were O
specific O
for O
l-alanine. B-Chemical
In O
addition, O
hNAT3 O
is O
a O
Na(+)- O
and O
pH-dependent, O
low-affinity O
transporter O
and O
partially O
tolerates O
substitution O
of O
Na(+) O
by O
Li(+). O
Since O
this O
protein O
has O
sequence O
and O
functional O
similarities O
to O
the O
previously O
identified O
system O
N O
amino O
acid O
transporters, O
we O
named O
this O
protein O
hNAT3. O
The O
genomic O
DNA O
sequence O
encoding O
the O
transcript O
of O
hNAT3 O
spans O
over O
14 O
kb O
with O
16 O
exons O
and O
15 O
introns. O
Using O
fluorescence O
in O
situ O
hybridization, O
we O
mapped O
the O
hNAT3 O
gene O
to O
human B-Species
chromosome O
12q12-q13. O
By O
RT-PCR O
of O
embryonic O
and O
adult O
human B-Species
tissues, O
hNAT3 O
was O
detected O
to O
be O
predominantly O
expressed O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
to O
a O
much O
lesser O
extent O
in O
the O
muscle, O
kidney, O
and O
pancreas. O
The O
data O
obtained O
in O
this O
study O
are O
likely O
to O
offer O
critical O
clues O
for O
identification O
of O
amino O
acid O
transporter-associated O
diseases. O
