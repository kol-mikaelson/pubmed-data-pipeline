# Abstract
We O
report O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
CHILD B-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
(MIM B-Disease
308050), I-Disease
an O
X-linked O
dominant, O
male-lethal O
trait O
characterized O
by O
an O
inflammatory B-Disease
nevus I-Disease
with O
striking O
lateralization O
and O
strict O
midline O
demarcation, O
as O
well O
as O
ipsilateral O
hypoplasia B-Disease
of O
the O
body O
is O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
gene O
NSDHL B-Gene
located O
at O
Xq28 B-Chromosome
(NAD(P)H O
steroid O
dehydrogenase-like O
protein) O
encoding O
a O
3beta-hydroxysteroid O

functioning O
in O
the O
cholesterol B-Chemical

pathway. O
SSCA O

6 O
patients B-Species

as O
well O
as O
a O

mutations O
potentially O
impairing O
protein O

This O

is O
distinct O

but O
shares O
various O
clinical O
and O
biochemical O
findings O
with O
chondrodysplasia B-Disease
punctata I-Disease
(CDPX2, B-Gene
MIM B-Disease
302960). I-Disease
CDPX2 B-Gene
is O
due O

mutations O
affecting O
a O
delta8-delta7 B-Gene
sterol I-Gene

(EBP, B-Gene
emopamil B-Gene

downstream O
of O
NSDHL B-Gene

in O
the O
patients B-Species

us O
demonstrating O
that O
CHILD B-Disease

for O
the O
study O
of O
CHILD B-Disease

a O
further O
human B-Species
