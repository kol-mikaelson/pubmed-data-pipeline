# Abstract
Concentrations O
of O
monoamine B-Chemical
metabolites O
(MM) O
in O
lumbar O
cerebrospinal O
fluid O
(CSF) O
have O
been O
used O
extensively O
as O
indirect O
estimates O
of O
monoamine B-Chemical
turnover O
in O
the O
brain. O
We O
investigated O
possible O
relationships O
between O
a O
putative O
functional O
promoter O
polymorphism O
in O
the O
monoamine B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
A I-Gene
(MAOA) B-Gene
gene O
and O
CSF O
concentrations O
of O
homovanillic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(HVA), B-Chemical
5-hydroxyindoleacetic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(5-HIAA), B-Chemical
and O
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol B-Chemical
(MHPG) B-Chemical
in O
healthy O
volunteers O
(n=88). O
Among O
women B-Species
(n=37), O
those O
carrying O
at O
least O
one O
copy O
of O
the O
alleles O
associated O
with O
more O
efficient O
transcription O
displayed O
higher O
concentrations O
of O
HVA B-Chemical
(p=0.01) O
and O
5-HIAA B-Chemical
(p=0.01). O
In O
men B-Species
(n=51), O
however, O
there O
was O
a O
tendency O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction. O
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
MAOA B-Gene

may O
participate O
differentially O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
and O
serotonin B-Chemical
turnover O
rates O
under O
presumed O
steady O
state O
in O
the O
central O
nervous O
system. O
The O
results O
should O
be O
interpreted O
with O
caution O
until O
