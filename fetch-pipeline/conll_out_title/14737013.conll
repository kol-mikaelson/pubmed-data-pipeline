the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
elucidate O
the O
expression O

(hOAT1) B-Gene
and O
hOAT3 B-Gene
in O
the O
choroid O

of O
the O
human B-Species
brain O
and O
their O
interactions O
with O
neurotransmitter O
metabolites O
using O
stable O

lines. O
Immunohistochemical O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
hOAT1 B-Gene
and O
hOAT3 B-Gene
are O
expressed O
in O
the O

and O
cytoplasm O
of O
human B-Species
