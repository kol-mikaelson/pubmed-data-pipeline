# Abstract
Renal O
organic B-Chemical
anion I-Chemical
transport O
systems O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
elimination O
of O
drugs, O
toxic O
compounds, O
and O
their O
metabolites, O
many O
of O
which O
are O
potentially O
harmful O
to O
the O
body. O
The O
renal O
proximal O
tubule O
is O
the O
primary O
site O
of O
carrier-mediated O
transport O
from O
blood O
to O
urine O
of O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
anionic O
substrates. O
Recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
organic B-Chemical
anion I-Chemical
secretion O
in O
renal O
proximal O
tubule O
is O
mediated O
by O
distinct O
sodium-dependent O
and O
sodium-independent O
transport O
systems. O
Knowledge O
of O
the O
molecular O
identity O
of O
these O
transporters O
and O
their O
substrate O
specificity O
has O
increased O
considerably O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
by O
cloning O
of O
various O
carrier O
proteins. O
However, O
a O
number O
of O
fundamental O
questions O
still O
have O
to O
be O
answered O
to O
elucidate O
the O
participation O
of O
the O
cloned O
transporters O
in O
the O
overall O
tubular O
secretion O
of O
anionic O
xenobiotics. O
This O
review O
summarizes O
the O
latest O
knowledge O
on O
molecular O
and O
pharmacological O
properties O
of O
renal O
organic B-Chemical
anion I-Chemical
transporters O
and O
homologs, O
with O
special O
reference O
to O
their O
nephron O
and O
plasma O
membrane O
localization, O
transport O
characteristics, O
and O
substrate O
and O
inhibitor O
specificity. O
A O
number O
of O
the O
recently O
cloned O
transporters, O
such O
as O
the O
p-aminohippurate O
dicarboxylate O
exchanger O
OAT1, B-Gene
the O
anion O
sulfate O
exchanger O
SAT1, B-Gene
the O
peptide O
transporters O
PEPT1 B-Gene
and O
PEPT2, B-Gene
and O
the O
nucleoside O
transporters O
CNT1 B-Gene
and O
CNT2, B-Gene
are O
key O
proteins O
in O
organic B-Chemical
anion I-Chemical
handling O
that O
possess O
the O
same O
characteristics O
as O
has O
been O
predicted O
from O
previous O
physiological O
studies. O
The O
role O
of O
other O
cloned O
transporters, O
such O
as O
MRP1, B-Gene
MRP2, B-Gene
OATP1, B-Gene
OAT-K1, O
and O
OAT-K2, O
is O
still O
poorly O
characterized, O
whereas O
the O
only O
information O
that O
is O
available O
on O
the O
homologs O
OAT2, O
OAT3, O
OATP3, O
and O
MRP3-6 O
is O
that O
they O
are O
expressed O
in O
the O
kidney, O
but O
their O
localization, O
not O
to O
mention O
their O
function, O
remains O
to O
be O
elucidated. O
