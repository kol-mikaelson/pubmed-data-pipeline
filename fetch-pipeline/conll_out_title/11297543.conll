# Abstract
Glutaredoxin B-Gene
(Grx) B-Gene
is O
a O
glutathione-dependent O
hydrogen B-Chemical
donor O
for O
ribonucleotide O
reductase. O
Today O
glutaredoxins O
are O
known O
as O
a O
multifunctional O
family O
of O
GSH-disulfide-oxidoreductases O
belonging O
to O
the O
thioredoxin B-Gene
fold O
superfamily. O
In O
contrast O
to O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
yeast, B-Species
a O
single O
human B-Species
glutaredoxin B-Gene
is O
known. O
We O
have O
identified O
and O
cloned O
a O
novel O
18-kDa O
human B-Species
dithiol B-Chemical
glutaredoxin, B-Gene
named O
glutaredoxin-2 B-Gene
(Grx2), B-Gene
which O
is O
34% O
identical O
to O
the O
previously O
known O
cytosolic O
12-kDa O
human B-Species
Grx1. B-Gene
The O
human B-Species
Grx2 B-Gene
sequence O
contains O
three O
characteristic O
regions O
of O
the O
glutaredoxin B-Gene
family: O
the O
dithiol B-Chemical
disulfide B-Chemical
active O
site, O
CSYC, O
the O
GSH B-Chemical
binding O
site, O
and O
a O
hydrophobic O
surface O
area. O
The O
human B-Species
Grx2 B-Gene
gene, O
located O
at O
chromosome O
1q31.2--31.3, O
consisted O
of O
five O
exons O
that O
were O
transcribed O
to O
a O
0.9-kilobase O
human B-Species
Grx2 B-Gene
mRNA O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
in O
several O
tissues. O
Two O
alternatively O
spliced O
Grx2 B-Gene
mRNA O
isoforms O
that O
differed O
in O
their O
5' O
region O
were O
identified. O
These O
corresponded O
to O
alternative O
proteins O
with O
a O
common O
125-residue O
C-terminal O
Grx B-Gene
domain O
but O
with O
different O
N-terminal O
extensions O
of O
39 O
and O
40 O
residues, O
respectively. O
The O
125-residue O
Grx B-Gene
domain O
and O
the O
two O
full-length O
variants O
were O
expressed O
in O
E. B-Species
coli I-Species
and O
exhibited O
GSH-dependent O
hydroxyethyl B-Chemical
disulfide I-Chemical
and O
dehydroascorbate B-Chemical
reducing O
activities. O
Western O
blot O
analysis O
of O
subcellular O
fractions O
from O
Jurkat B-CellLine
cells O
with O
a O
specific O
anti-Grx2 O
antibody O
showed O
that O
human B-Species
Grx2 B-Gene
was O
predominantly O
located O
in O
the O
nucleus O
but O
also O
present O
in O
the O
mitochondria. O
We O
further O
showed O
that O
one O
of O
the O
mRNA O
isoforms O
corresponding O
to O
Grx2a O
encoded O
a O
functional O
N-terminal O
mitochondrial O
translocation O
signal. O
