# Abstract
The O
transporter-mediated O
uptake O
of O
drugs O
from O
blood O
into O
hepatocytes O
is O
a O
prerequisite O
for O
intrahepatic O
drug O
action O
or O
intracellular O
drug O
metabolism O
before O
excretion. O
Therefore, O
uptake O
transporters, O
e.g., O
members O
of O
the O
organic O
anion O
transporting O
polypeptide O
(OATP) O
family O
are O
important O
determinants O
of O
drug O
pharmacokinetics. O
Highly O
and O
almost O
exclusively O
expressed O
in O
hepatocytes O
are O
the O
OATP O
family O
members O
OATP1B1 B-Gene
(SLCO1B1) B-Gene
and O
OATP1B3 B-Gene
(SLCO1B3). B-Gene
Drug O
substrates O
of O
OATP1B1 B-Gene
and O
OATP1B3 B-Gene
include O
antibiotics O
and O
HMG-CoA O
reductase O
inhibitors O
(statins). O
It O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
administration O
of O
two O
or O
more O
drugs O
that O
are O
substrates O
for O
these O
hepatic O
uptake O
transporters O
may O
lead O
to O
transporter-mediated O
drug-drug O
interactions, O
resulting O
in O
altered O
transport O
kinetics O
for O
drug O
substrates. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
investigated O
whether O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
(NSAIDs) O
and O
paracetamol B-Chemical
interact O
with O
OATP1B1 B-Gene
and O
OATP1B3 B-Gene
using O
the O
standard O
substrate O
BSP B-Chemical
and O
the O
drug O
substrate O
pravastatin. B-Chemical
Using O
human B-Species
embryonic O
kidney O
cells O
stably O
expressing O
OATP1B1 B-Gene
or O
OATP1B3, B-Gene
we O
demonstrated O
that O
bromosulfophthalein B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
inhibited O
by O
diclofenac, B-Chemical
ibuprofen. B-Chemical
and O
lumiracoxib. B-Chemical
Of O
interest, O
pravastatin B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
stimulated O
by O
these O
NSAIDs, O
and O
for O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
we O
determined O
activation O
constants O
(EC50 O
values) O
of O
64.0 O
and O
93.1 O
muM O
for O
OATP1B1- B-Gene
and O
OATP1B3-mediated O
uptake, O
respectively. O
Furthermore, O
we O
investigated O
whether O
NSAIDs O
were O
also O
substrates O
for O
OATP1B1 B-Gene
and O
OATP1B3 B-Gene
and O
demonstrated O
that O
only O
diclofenac B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
transported O
by O
OATP1B3, B-Gene
whereas O
all O
other O
NSAIDs O
investigated O
were O
not O
substrates O
for O
these O
uptake O
transporters. O
These O
results O
demonstrated O
that O
drugs O
may O
interact O
with O
transport O
proteins O
by O
allosteric O
mechanisms O
without O
being O
substrates O
and, O
therefore, O
not O
only O
uptake O
inhibition O
but O
also O
allosteric-induced O
modulation O
of O
transport O
function O
may O
be O
an O
important O
mechanism O
in O
transporter-mediated O
drug-drug O
interactions. O
