# Abstract
Prostaglandin B-Chemical
glycerol I-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
(PG-Gs) B-Chemical
and O
prostaglandin B-Chemical
ethanolamides I-Chemical
(PG-EAs) B-Chemical
are O
generated O
by O
the O
action O
of O
cyclooxygenase-2 B-Gene
on O
the O
endocannabinoids B-Chemical
2-arachidonylglycerol B-Chemical
(2-AG) B-Chemical
and O
arachidonylethanolamide, B-Chemical
respectively. O
These O
novel O
eicosanoids B-Chemical
may O
have O
unique O
pharmacological O
properties O
and O
or O
serve O
as O
latent O
sources O
of O
prostaglandins B-Chemical
at O
sites O
remote O
from O
their O
tissue O
of O
origin. O
Therefore, O
we O
investigated O
the O
metabolism O
of O
PG-Gs B-Chemical
and O
PG-EAs B-Chemical
in O
vitro O
and O
in O
vivo. O
PGE(2)-G B-Chemical
was O

hydrolyzed O
in O
rat B-Species

to O
generate O
PGE(2) B-Chemical

but O
was O
only O
slowly O
metabolized O
in O
human B-Species

(t(1 O

10 O

An O
intermediate O
extent O
of O
metabolism O
of O
PGE(2)-G B-Chemical
was O
observed O
in O
human B-Species
whole O

(t(1 O

approximately O
7 O
min). O
The O
parent O
arachidonylglycerol, B-Chemical
2-AG, B-Chemical
and O
the O
more O
stable O
regioisomer, O
1-AG, B-Chemical
also O
were O
much O
more O
rapidly O
metabolized O
in O
rat B-Species
plasma O
compared O
with O
human B-Species
plasma. O
PGE(2)-EA B-Chemical
was O
not O
significantly O
hydrolyzed O
in O
plasma, O
undergoing O
slow O
dehydration O
isomerization O
to O
PGB(2)-EA. B-Chemical
Both O
PGE(2)-G B-Chemical
and O
PGE(2)-EA B-Chemical
were O
stable O
in O
canine, B-Species
bovine, B-Species
and O
human B-Species
cerebrospinal O
fluid. O
Human B-Species
15-hydroxyprostaglandin B-Gene

the O
enzyme O
responsible O
for O
the O
initial O

PG B-Chemical
inactivation O
in O
vivo, O
oxidized O
both O
PGE(2)-G B-Chemical
and O
PGE(2)-EA B-Chemical
less O
efficiently O
than O
the O
free O
acid. O
The O
sterically O
hindered O
glyceryl B-Chemical
prostaglandin I-Chemical
was O
the O
poorest O
substrate O
examined O
in O
the O
E O
series. O
Minimal O
15-hydroxyprostaglandin B-Gene

oxidation O
of O
PGF(2 B-Chemical
alpha)-G I-Chemical
was O
observed. O
PGE(2)-G B-Chemical
and O
PGE(2)-EA B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics O
were O
assessed O
in O
rats. B-Species
PGE(2)-G B-Chemical
was O
not O
detected O
in O
plasma O
5 O
min O
following O
an O
intravenous O
dose O
of O
2 O
mg O
kg. O
However, O
PGE(2)-EA B-Chemical
was O
detectable O
up O
to O
2 O
h O
following O
an O
identical O
dose, O
displaying O
a O
large O
apparent O
volume O
of O
distribution O
and O
a O
half-life O
of O
over O
6 O
min. O
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
endocannabinoid-derived O
PG-like O
compounds O
may O
be O
sufficiently O
stable O
in O
humans B-Species
to O
exert O
actions O
systemically. O
Furthermore, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
the O
rat B-Species
is O
not O
an O
adequate O
model O
for O
investigating O
the O
biological O
activities O
of O
2-arachidonylglycerol B-Chemical
or O
glyceryl B-Chemical
prostaglandins I-Chemical
in O
humans. B-Species
