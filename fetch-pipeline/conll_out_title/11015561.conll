# Abstract
Three O
human B-Species
glutaminase B-Gene
(hGA) O
isoforms O
were O
identified, O
two O
of O
which O
represent O
isoforms O
previously O
unidentified O
in O
any O
species. O
One O
isoform O
contains O
an O
open O
reading O
frame O
with O
high O
homology O
with O
the O
rat B-Species
kidney-type B-Gene
glutaminase, B-Gene
suggesting O
that O
this O
isoform O
represents O
the O
human B-Species
kidney-type B-Gene
glutaminase, B-Gene
hKGA. O
A O
second O
isoform, O
termed O
hGAC, O
contains O
an O
open O
reading O
frame O
that O
matches O
hKGA O
except O
for O
a O
unique O
COOH-terminal O
amino O
acid O
sequence. O
In O
addition, O
a O
third O
human B-Species
glutaminase B-Gene
isoform O
was O
identified O
from O
a O
computer O
search O
and O
on O
further O
analysis O
was O
found O
to O
represent O
an O
additional O
unique O
isoform, O
hGAM. O
hKGA O
is O
expressed O
predominantly O
in O
brain O
and O
kidney O
but O
not O
in O
liver, O
hGAC O
is O
expressed O
principally O
in O
cardiac O
muscle O
and O
pancreas O
but O
not O
in O
liver O
or O
brain, O
and O
hGAM O
is O
expressed O
solely O
in O
cardiac O
and O
skeletal O
muscle. O
hGAC O
is O
the O
predominant O
isoform O
expressed O
by O
a O
human B-Species
breast B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
cell O
line O
that O
exhibits O
a O
high O
rate O
of O
glutamine B-Chemical
utilization O
and O
glutaminase B-Gene
activity. O
Genomic O
Southern O
analysis O
as O
well O
as O
isolation O
and O
analysis O
of O
five O
glutaminase B-Gene
genomic O
clones O
suggested O
that O
all O
three O
hGA O
isoforms O
originate O
from O
the O
same O
locus O
and O
therefore O
represent O
mRNA O
species O
that O
are O
produced O
by O
tissue-specific O
alternative O
splicing O
of O
a O
single O
pre-mRNA. O
Furthermore, O
an O
RT-PCR O
assay O
was O
developed O
that O
can O
be O
used O
to O
easily O
differentiate O
between O
hKGA O
and O
hGAC O
mRNA O
species. O
