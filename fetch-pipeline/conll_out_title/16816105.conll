# Abstract
Intracellular O
concentrations O
of O
the O
four O
deoxyribonucleoside B-Chemical
triphosphates I-Chemical
(dNTPs) B-Chemical
are O
closely O
regulated, O
and O
imbalances O
in O
the O
four O
dNTP B-Chemical
pools O
have O
genotoxic O
consequences. O
Replication O
errors O
leading O
to O
mutations O
can O
occur, O
for O
example, O
if O
one O
dNTP B-Chemical
in O
excess O
drives O
formation O
of O
a O
non-Watson-Crick O
base O
pair O
or O
if O
it O
forces O
replicative O
DNA O

elongation O
past O
a O
mismatch O
before O
DNA O
polymerase O
can O
correct O
the O
error O
by O
3' O
exonuclease O
proofreading. O
This O
review O
focuses O
on O
developments O
since O
1994, O
when O
the O
field O
was O
last O
reviewed O
comprehensively. O
Emphasis O
is O
placed O
on O
the O
following O
topics: O
1) O
novel O
aspects O
of O
dNTP B-Chemical
pool O
regulation, O
2) O
dNTP B-Chemical
pool O
asymmetries O
as O
mutagenic O
determinants, O
3) O
dNTP B-Chemical
metabolism O
and O
hypermutagenesis O
of O
retroviral O
genomes, O
4) O
dNTP B-Chemical
metabolism O
and O
mutagenesis O
in O
the O
mitochondrial O
genome, O
5) O
chemical O
modification O
of O
nucleotides O
as O
a O
premutagenic O
event, O
6) O
relationships O
between O
dNTP B-Chemical
metabolism, O
genome O
stability, O
aging, O
and O
cancer. O
