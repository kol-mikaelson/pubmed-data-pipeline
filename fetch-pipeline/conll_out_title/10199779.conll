# Abstract
Sulfation O
is O
an O
important O
pathway O
of O
thyroid O
hormone O
metabolism O
that O
facilitates O
the O
degradation O
of O
the O
hormone O
by O
the O
type B-Gene
I I-Gene
iodothyronine B-Chemical
deiodinase, I-Gene
but O
little O
is O
known O
about O
which O
human B-Species
sulfotransferase O
isoenzymes O
are O
involved. O
We O
have O
investigated O
the O
sulfation O
of O
the O
prohormone O
T4, O
the O
active O
hormone O
T3, B-Chemical
and O
the O

and O
3,3'-diiodothyronine B-Chemical

known O
as O
phenol-preferring O

respectively. O

The O

was O
inhibited O
by O
the O
other O
iodothyronines B-Chemical

manner. O
The O

These O

Of O
the O

SULT1A1 B-Gene
clearly O
shows O
the O
highest O
affinity O
for O
both O
iodothyronines B-Chemical

but O
it O
remains O
to O

established O
whether O
it O
is O
the O

thyroid O

in O
human B-Species
