The O

# Abstract
Maternal O
duplications O
of O
the O
imprinted O
15q11-13 B-Chromosome
domain O
result O
in O
an O
estimated O
1%-2% O
of O
autism-spectrum B-Disease
disorders, I-Disease
and O
linkage O
to O
autism B-Disease
has O
been O
identified O
within O
15q12-13. B-Chromosome
UBE3A, B-Gene
the O
Angelman B-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
gene, O
has, O
to O
date, O
been O
the O
only O
maternally O
expressed, O
imprinted O
gene O
identified O
within O
this O
region, O
but O
mutations O
have O
not O
been O
found O
in O
autistic B-Disease
patients. B-Species
Here O
we O
describe O
the O
characterization O
of O
ATP10C, B-Gene
a O
new O
human B-Species
imprinted O
gene, O
which O
encodes O
a O
putative O
protein O
homologous O
to O
the O
mouse B-Species
aminophospholipid-transporting O
ATPase O
Atp10c. B-Gene
ATP10C B-Gene
maps O
within O
200 O
kb O
distal O
to O
UBE3A B-Gene
and, O
like O
UBE3A, B-Gene
also O
demonstrates O
imprinted, O
preferential O
maternal O
expression O
in O
human B-Species
brain. O
The O
location O
and O
imprinted O
expression O
of O
ATP10C B-Gene
thus O
make O
it O
a O
candidate O
for O
chromosome O
15-associated O
autism B-Disease
and O
suggest O
that O
it O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
Angelman B-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
phenotype. O
