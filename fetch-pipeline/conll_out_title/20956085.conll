# Abstract
Tetrahydrobiopterin B-Chemical
(BH(4)) B-Chemical
is O
synthesized O
de O
novo O
in O
particular O
cells, O
but O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
systemic O
or O
local O
BH(4) B-Chemical
deficiency, O
BH(4) B-Chemical
supplementation O
therapy O
is O
applied. O
BH(4)-responsive O
PKU B-Disease
has O
also O
been O
effectively O
treated O
with O
BH(4) B-Chemical
supplementation. O
However, O
the O
rapid O
clearance O
of O
the O
supplemented O
BH(4) B-Chemical
has O
prevented O
the O
therapy O
from O
being O
widely O
accepted. O
Deposition O
of O
BH(4) B-Chemical
after O
supplementation O
involves O
oxidation O
of O
BH(4) B-Chemical
to O
dihydrobiopterin B-Chemical
(BH(2)) B-Chemical
and O
subsequent O
conversion O
to O
BH(4) B-Chemical
by O
the O
salvage O
pathway. O
This O
pathway O
is O
known O
to O
be O
almost O
ubiquitous O
in O
the O
body. O
However, O
the O
mechanism O
for O
the O
redistribution O
and O
exclusion O
of O
BH(4) B-Chemical
across O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
remains O
unclear. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
work O
was O
to O
search O
for O
the O
key O
transporter O
of O
the O
uptake O
precursor O
of O
the O
salvage O
pathway. O
Based O
on O
the O
observed O
sensitivity O
of O
pterin B-Chemical
transport O
to O
nitrobenzylthioinosine B-Chemical
(NBMPR), B-Chemical
we O
examined O
the O
ability O
of O
ENT1 B-Gene
and O
ENT2, B-Gene
representative O
equilibrative O
nucleoside O
transporters, O
to O
transport O
sepiapterin B-Chemical
(SP), B-Chemical
BH(2) B-Chemical
or O
BH(4) B-Chemical
using O
HeLa B-CellLine
cell O
and O
Xenopus B-Species
oocyte O
expression O
systems. O
hENT2 O
was O
capable O
of O
transporting O
the O
pterins B-Chemical
with O
an O
efficiency O
of O
SP>BH(2)>BH(4). O
hENT1 O
could O
also O
transport O
the O
pterins B-Chemical
but O
less O
efficiently. O
Non-transfected O
HeLa B-CellLine
cells O
and O
rat B-Species
aortic O
endothelial O
cells O
were O
able O
to O
incorporate O
the O
pterins B-Chemical
and O
accumulate O
BH(4) B-Chemical
via O
uptake O
that O
is O
likely O
mediated O
by O
ENT2 B-Gene
(SP>BH(2)>BH(4)). O
When O
exogenous O
BH(2) B-Chemical
was O
given O
to O
mice, B-Species
it O
was O
efficiently O
converted O
to O
BH(4) B-Chemical
and O
its O
tissue O
deposition O
was O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
sepiapterin B-Chemical
as O
reported O
(Sawabe O
et O
al., O
2004). O
BH(4) B-Chemical
deposition O
after O
BH(2) B-Chemical
administration O
was O
influenced O
by O
prior O
treatment O
with O
NBMPR, B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
the O
distribution O
of O
the O
administered O
BH(2) B-Chemical
was O
largely O
mediated O
by O
ENT2, B-Gene
although O
urinary O
excretion O
appeared O
to O
be O
managed O
by O
other O
mechanisms. O
The O
molecular O
basis O
of O
the O
transport O
of O
SP, B-Chemical
BH(2), B-Chemical
and O
BH(4) B-Chemical
across O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
has O
now O
been O
described O
for O
the O
first O
time: O
ENT2 B-Gene
is O
a O
transporter O
of O
these O
pterins B-Chemical
and O
is O
a O
plausible O
gateway O
to O
the O
salvage O
pathway O
of O
BH(4) B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
at O
least O
under O
conditions O
of O
exogenous O
pterin B-Chemical
supplementation. O
The O
significance O
of O
the O
gateway O
was O
discussed O
in O
terms O
of O
BH(2) B-Chemical
uptake O
for O
BH(4) B-Chemical
accumulation O
and O
the O
release O
for O
modifying O
the O
intracellular O
BH(2) B-Chemical
BH(4) B-Chemical
ratio. O
