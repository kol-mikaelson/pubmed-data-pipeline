# Abstract
The O
penultimate O
step O
in O
carnitine B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
is O
mediated O
by O
gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(EC O
1.2.1.47), O
a O
cytosolic O
NAD(+)-dependent O
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
that O
converts O
gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde B-Chemical
into O
gamma-butyrobetaine. B-Chemical
This O
enzyme O
was O
purified O
from O
rat B-Species
liver, O
and O
two O
internal O
peptide O
fragments O
were O
sequenced O
by O
Edman O
degradation. O
The O
peptide O
sequences O
were O
used O

which O
led O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
rat B-Species
cDNA O
containing O
an O

of O
1485 O
base O

encoding O
a O
polypeptide O
of O
494 O
amino O

with O
a O

molecular O

of O
55 O
kDa. O
Expression O
of O
the O
coding O
sequence O
in O
Escherichia B-Species
coli I-Species
confirmed O
that O
the O
cDNA O
encodes O
gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde B-Gene
dehydrogenase. I-Gene
The O
previously O
identified O
human B-Species
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
9 O
(EC O
1.2.1.19) O
has O
92% O
identity O
with O
rat B-Species
trimethylaminobutyraldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
and O
has O
been O
reported O
to O
convert O
substrates O
that O
resemble O
gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde. B-Chemical
When O
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
9 O
was O
expressed O
in O
E. B-Species
coli, I-Species
it O
exhibited O
high O
trimethylaminobutyraldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
activity. O
Furthermore, O
comparison O
of O
the O
enzymatic O
characteristics O
of O
the O
heterologously O
expressed O
human B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
dehydrogenases O
with O
those O
of O
purified O
rat B-Species
liver O
trimethylaminobutyraldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
revealed O
that O
the O
three O
enzymes O
have O
highly O
similar O
substrate O
specificities. O
In O
addition, O
the O
highest O
V(max) O
K(m) O
values O
were O
obtained O
with O
gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde B-Chemical
as O
substrate. O
This O
indicates O
that O
human B-Species
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
9 O
is O
the O
gamma-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde B-Gene
dehydrogenase, I-Gene
which O
functions O
in O
carnitine B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
