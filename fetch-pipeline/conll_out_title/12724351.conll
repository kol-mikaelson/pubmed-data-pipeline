# Abstract
Some O
organic O
anions O
are O
absorbed O
from O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
through O
carrier-mediated O
transport O
mechanism(s), O
which O
may O
include O
proton-coupled O
transport, O
anion O
exchange O
transport, O
and O
others. O
However, O
the O
molecular O
identity O
of O
the O
organic O
anion O
transporters O
localized O
at O
the O
apical O
membrane O
of O
human B-Species
intestinal O

has O
not O
been O
clearly O
demonstrated. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
focused O
on O
human B-Species
organic O
anion O
transporting O
polypeptide O
OATP-B B-Gene
and O
examined O
its O
subcellular O
localization O
and O
functionality O
in O
the O
small O
intestine. O
Localization O
of O
OATP-B B-Gene
was O
determined O
by O
immunohistochemical O
analysis. O

293 O

than O

[3H]Estrone-3-sulfate B-Chemical

acid. I-Chemical
The O
inhibitory O
effect O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
on O
the O
uptake O
of O
[3H]estrone-3-sulfate B-Chemical
was O
concentration-dependent, O
and O
the O
IC50 O
value O
was O
5.5 O
mM. O
The O
results O
suggested O
that O
OATP-B B-Gene
mediates O
absorption O
of O
anionic O
compounds O
and O
its O
activity O
may O
be O
optimum O
at O
the O
acidic O
surface O
microclimate O
pH O
of O
the O
small O
intestine. O
Accordingly, O
OATP-B B-Gene
plays O
a O
role O
in O
the O
absorption O
of O
anionic O
compounds O
across O
the O
apical O
membrane O
of O
human B-Species
intestinal O
epithelial O
cells, O
although O
it O
cannot O
be O
decisively O
concluded O
that O
pH-dependent O
absorption O
of O
pravastatin B-Chemical
is O
determined O
by O
OATP-B B-Gene
alone. O
