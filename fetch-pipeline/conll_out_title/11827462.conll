# Abstract
System O
T O
is O
a O
Na+-independent O
transport O
system O
that O
selectively O
transports O
aromatic B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
Here, O
we O
determined O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
human B-Species
T-type B-Gene
amino-acid I-Gene
transporter-1 I-Gene
(TAT1) B-Gene
cDNA O
and O
gene O
(SLC16A10). B-Gene
The O
human B-Species
TAT1 B-Gene
cDNA O
encoded O
a O
515-amino-acid O
protein O
with O
12 O
putative O
membrane-spanning O
domains. O
Human B-Species
SLC16A10 B-Gene
was O
localized O
on O
human B-Species
chromosome B-Chromosome
6, I-Chromosome
mapped O
to O
6q21-q22. O
SLC16A10 B-Gene
contains O
six O
exons O
spanning O
136 O
kb. O
In O
contrast O
to O
rat B-Species
TAT1, B-Gene
which O
is O
mainly O
present O
in O
the O
intestine, O
human B-Species
TAT1 B-Gene
was O
strongly O
expressed O
in O
human B-Species
kidney O
as O
well O
as O
in O
human B-Species
intestine. O
Expression O
of O
human B-Species
TAT1 B-Gene
in O
Xenopus B-Species

oocytes O
demonstrated O
the O
Na+-independent O
transport O
of O
tryptophan, B-Chemical
tyrosine, B-Chemical
phenylalanine, B-Chemical
and O
L-dopa, B-Chemical
indicating O
that O
human B-Species
TAT1 B-Gene
is O
a O
transporter O
subserving O
system O
T. O
Because O
human B-Species
TAT1 B-Gene
is O
proposed O
to O
be O
crucial O
to O
the O
efficient O
absorption O
of O
aromatic B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
from O
intestine O
and O
kidney, O
its O
defect O
could O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
disruption O
of O
aromatic B-Chemical
amino-acid I-Chemical
transport, O
such O
