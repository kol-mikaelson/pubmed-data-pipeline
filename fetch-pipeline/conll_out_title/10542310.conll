# Abstract
We O
have O
cloned O
a O
1.23 O
kb O
cDNA O
from O
a O
human B-Species
heart O
library O
which O
encodes O
a O
32 O
kDa O
protein O
that O
is O
94% O
identical O
to O
bovine B-Species
inorganic B-Gene
pyrophosphatase. I-Gene
The O
protein O
contains O
an O
aspartate-rich O
signature O
sequence O
that O
was O
previously O
identified O
in O
yeast O
and O
prokaryotic O
pyrophosphatases. O
Our O
clone O
detects O
a O
single O
band O
on O
Northern O
blots O
and O
is O
expressed O
at O
modest O
levels O
in O
all O
tissues O
examined. O
The O
cDNA O
shows O
linkage O
to O
markers O
on O
the O
long O
arm O
of O
chromosome O
10. O
