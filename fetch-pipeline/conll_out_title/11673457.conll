pristanic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
xenobiotic O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
These O
lipids B-Chemical
are O
mainly O
chain-shortened O
for O
excretion O
as O
the O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
or O
transported O
to O
mitochondria O
for O
further O
metabolism. O
Several O
of O
these O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
slowly O
oxidized O
and O
may O
therefore O
sequester O
coenzyme B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
(CoASH). B-Chemical
To O
prevent O

of O
chain-shortened B-Chemical

acyl-CoA O
thioesterases, O
which O
catalyze O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
to O
the O
free O
acid O
and O
CoASH, B-Chemical
may O
play O
important O
roles. O
Here O
we O
have O
cloned O
and O
characterized O
a O
peroxisomal O
acyl-CoA O
thioesterase O
from O
mouse, B-Species
named O
PTE-2 B-Gene
(peroxisomal B-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
thioesterase I-Gene
2). I-Gene
PTE-2 B-Gene
is O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
and O
induced O
at O
mRNA O
level O
by O
treatment O
with O
the O
peroxisome O
proliferator O
WY-14,643 B-Chemical
and O
fasting. O
Induction O
seen O
by O
these O
treatments O
was O
dependent O
on O
the O
peroxisome B-Gene
proliferator-activated I-Gene
receptor I-Gene
alpha. I-Gene
Recombinant O
PTE-2 B-Gene
showed O
a O
broad O
chain O
length O
specificity O
with O
acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
from O
short- O
and O
medium-, O
to O
long-chain O
acyl-CoAs, B-Chemical
and O
other O
substrates O
including O
trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA, B-Chemical
hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, B-Chemical
and O
branched B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
acyl-CoAs, I-Chemical
all O
of O
which O
are O
present O
in O
peroxisomes. O
Highest O
activities O
were O
found O
with O
the O
CoA B-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
of O
primary O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
choloyl-CoA B-Chemical
and O
chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA B-Chemical
as O
substrates. O
PTE-2 B-Gene
activity O
is O
inhibited O
by O
free O
CoASH, B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
intraperoxisomal O
free O
CoASH B-Chemical
levels O
regulate O
the O
activity O
of O
this O
enzyme. O
The O
acyl-CoA O
specificity O
of O
recombinant O
PTE-2 B-Gene
closely O
resembles O
that O
of O
purified O
mouse B-Species
liver O
peroxisomes, O
suggesting O
that O
PTE-2 B-Gene
is O
the O
major O
acyl-CoA O
thioesterase O
in O
peroxisomes. O
Addition O
of O
recombinant O
PTE-2 B-Gene
to O
incubations O
containing O
isolated O
mouse B-Species
liver O
peroxisomes O
strongly O
inhibited O
bile B-Gene

acid I-Gene
N-acyltransferase I-Gene
activity, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
thioesterase O
can O
interfere O
with O
CoASH-dependent O
pathways. O
We O
propose O
that O
PTE-2 B-Gene
functions O
as O
a O
key O
regulator O
of O
peroxisomal O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism. O
