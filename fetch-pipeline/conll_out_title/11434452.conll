# Abstract
Ethylene B-Chemical
glycol, I-Chemical
a O
common O
antifreeze, O
coolant O
and O
industrial O
solvent, O
is O
responsible O
for O
many O
instances O
of O
accidental O
and O
intentional O
poisoning B-Disease
annually. O
Following O
ingestion, O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol I-Chemical
is O
first O
hepatically O
metabolised O
to O
glycoaldehyde B-Chemical
by O
alcohol B-Gene
dehydrogenase. I-Gene
Glycoaldehyde B-Chemical
is O
then O
oxidised O
to O
glycolic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
glyoxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
finally O
oxalic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
While O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol I-Chemical
itself O
causes O
intoxication, O
the O
accumulation O
of O
toxic O
metabolites O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
potentially O
fatal O
acidosis B-Disease
and O
renal B-Disease
failure, I-Disease
which O
characterises O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol I-Chemical
poisoning. I-Chemical
Treatment O
of O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol I-Chemical
poisoning I-Chemical
consists O
of O
emergent O
stabilisation, O
correction O
of O
metabolic B-Disease
acidosis, I-Disease
inhibition O
of O
further O
metabolism O
and O
enhancing O
elimination O
of O
both O
unmetabolised O
parent O
compound O
and O
its O
metabolites. O
The O
prevention O
of O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol I-Chemical
metabolism O
is O
accomplished O
by O
the O
use O
of O
antidotes O
that O
inhibit O
alcohol B-Gene
dehydrogenase. I-Gene
Historically, O
this O
has O
been O
done O
with O
intoxicating O
doses O
of O
ethanol. B-Chemical
At O
a O
sufficiently O
high O
concentration, O
ethanol B-Chemical
saturates O
alcohol B-Gene
dehydrogenase, I-Gene
preventing O
it O
from O
acting O
on O
ethylene B-Chemical
glycol, I-Chemical
thus O
allowing O
the O
latter O
to O
be O
excreted O
unchanged O
by O
the O
kidneys. O
However, O
ethanol B-Chemical
therapy O
is O
complicated O
by O
its O
own O
inherent O
toxicity, B-Disease
and O
the O
need O
to O
carefully O
monitor O
serum O
ethanol B-Chemical
concentrations O
and O
adjust O
the O
rate O
of O
administration. O
A O
recent O
alternative O
to O
ethanol B-Chemical
therapy O
is O
fomepizole, B-Chemical
or O
4-methylpyrazole. B-Chemical
Like O
ethanol, B-Chemical
fomepizole B-Chemical
inhibits O
alcohol B-Gene
dehydrogenase; I-Gene
however O
it O
does O
so O
without O
producing O
serious O
adverse O
effects. O
Unlike O
ethanol, B-Chemical
fomepizole B-Chemical
is O
metabolised O
in O
a O
predictable O
manner, O
allowing O
for O
the O
use O
of O
a O
standard, O
validated O
administration O
regimen. O
Fomepizole B-Chemical
therapy O
eliminates O
the O
need O
for O
the O
haemodialysis O
that O
is O
required O
in O
selected O
patients B-Species
who O
are O
non-acidotic O
and O
have O
adequate O
renal O
function. O
