# Abstract
Although O
long O
suspected O
from O
histochemical O
evidence O
for O
carbonic O
anhydrase O
(CA) O
activity O
on O
neurons O
and O
observations O
that O
CA O
inhibitors O
enhance O
the O
extracellular O
alkaline O
shifts O
associated O
with O
synaptic O
transmission, O
an O
extracellular O
CA O
in O
brain O
had O
not O
been O
identified. O
A O
candidate O
for O
this O
CA O
was O
suggested O
by O
the O
recent O
discovery O
of O
membrane O
CA O
(CA B-Gene
XIV) I-Gene
whose O
mRNA O
is O
expressed O
in O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
brain O
and O
in O
several O
other O
tissues. O
For O
immunolocalization O
of O
CA B-Gene
XIV I-Gene
in O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
brain, O
we O
developed O
two O
antibodies, O
one O
against O
a O
secretory O
form O
of O
enzymatically O
active O
recombinant O
mouse B-Species
CA B-Gene
XIV, I-Gene
and O
one O
against O
a O
synthetic O
peptide O
corresponding O
to O
the O
24 O
C-terminal O
amino O
acids O
in O
the O
human B-Species
enzyme. O
Immunostaining O
for O
CA B-Gene
XIV I-Gene
was O
found O
on O
neuronal O
membranes O
and O
axons O
in O
both O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
brain. O
The O
highest O
expression O
was O
seen O
on O
large O
neuronal O
bodies O
and O
axons O
in O
the O
anterolateral O
part O
of O
pons O
and O
medulla O
oblongata. O
Other O
CA O
XIV-positive O
sites O
included O
the O
hippocampus, O
corpus O
callosum, O
cerebellar O
white O
matter O
and O
peduncles, O
pyramidal O
tract, O
and O
choroid O
plexus. O
Mouse B-Species
brain O
also O
showed O
a O
positive O
reaction O
in O
the O
molecular O
layer O
of O
the O
cerebral O
cortex O
and O
granular O
cellular O
layer O
of O
the O
cerebellum. O
These O
observations O
make O
CA B-Gene
XIV I-Gene
a O
likely O
candidate O
for O
the O
extracellular O
CA O
postulated O
to O
have O
an O
important O
role O
in O
modulating O
excitatory O
synaptic O
transmission O
in O
brain. O
