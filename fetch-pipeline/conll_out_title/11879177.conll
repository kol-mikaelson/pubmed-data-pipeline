# Abstract
Glucose-6-phosphatase B-Gene
(G6Pase), B-Gene
an O
enzyme O
found O
mainly O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
the O
kidneys, O
plays O
the O
important O
role O
of O
providing O
glucose B-Chemical
during O
starvation. O
Unlike O
most O
phosphatases O
acting O
on O
water-soluble O
compounds, O
it O
is O
a O
membrane-bound O
enzyme, O
being O
associated O
with O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum. O
In O
1975, O
W. O
Arion O
and O
co-workers O
proposed O
a O
model O
according O
to O
which O
G6Pase B-Gene
was O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
rather O
unspecific O
phosphatase, O
with O
its O
catalytic O
site O
oriented O
towards O
the O
lumen O
of O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O

Substrate O
would O
be O
provided O
to O
this O
enzyme O
by O
a O
translocase O
that O
is O
specific O
for O
glucose B-Chemical
6-phosphate, I-Chemical
thereby O
accounting O
for O
the O
specificity O
of O
the O
phosphatase O
for O
glucose B-Chemical
6-phosphate I-Chemical
in O
intact O
microsomes. O
Distinct O
transporters O
would O
allow O
inorganic B-Chemical
phosphate I-Chemical
and O
glucose B-Chemical
to O
leave O
the O
vesicles. O
At O
variance O
with O
this O
substrate-transport O
model, O
other O
models O
propose O
that O
conformational O
changes O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
properties O
of O
G6Pase. B-Gene
The O
last O
10 O
years O
have O
witnessed O
important O
progress O
in O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
glucose B-Chemical
6-phosphate I-Chemical
hydrolysis O
system. O
The O
genes O
encoding O
G6Pase B-Gene
and O
the O
glucose B-Chemical
6-phosphate I-Gene
translocase I-Gene
have O
been O
cloned O
and O
shown O
to O
be O
mutated O
in O
glycogen B-Disease
storage I-Disease
disease I-Disease
type I-Disease
Ia I-Disease
and I-Disease
type I-Disease
Ib I-Disease
respectively. O
The O
gene O
encoding O
a O
G6Pase-related O
protein, O
expressed O
specifically O
in O
pancreatic O
islets, O
has O
also O
been O
cloned. O
Specific O
potent O
inhibitors O
of O
G6Pase B-Gene
and O
of O
the O
glucose B-Chemical
6-phosphate I-Gene
translocase I-Gene
have O
been O
synthesized O
or O
isolated O
from O
micro-organisms. O
These O
as O
well O
as O
other O
findings O
support O
the O
model O
initially O
proposed O
by O
Arion. O
Much O
progress O
has O
also O
been O
made O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
regulation O
of O
the O
expression O
of O
G6Pase B-Gene
by O
insulin, B-Gene
glucocorticoids, O
cAMP B-Chemical
and O
