# Abstract
The O
UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide O
N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase O
(ppGaNTase) O
family O
of O
enzymes O
initiates O
mucin-like O
O-glycosylation O
of O
specific O
proteins. O
Using O
exon-prediction O
analysis O
on O
genomic O
sequence O
from O
human B-Species
chromosome B-Chromosome
12p13.3, I-Chromosome
we O
identified O
novel O
exons O
that O
shared O
significant O
homology O
with O
the O
ppGaNTases. O
cDNA O
library O
screening O
and O
RT-PCR O
produced O
the O
complete O
coding O
sequence O
of O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
ppGaNTase O
family O
member, O
designated O
GalNAc-T8. B-Gene
The O
open O
reading O
frame O
(ORF) O
of O
GalNAc-T8 B-Gene
codes O
for O
a O
637 O
amino O
acid, O
type-II O
membrane O
protein O
that O
is O
45-60% O
identical O
to O
the O
other O
mammalian O
ppGaNTases. O
GalNAc-T8 B-Gene
shares O
high O
homology O
within O
the O
functional O
regions O
of O
the O
known O
ppGaNTases; O
however, O
the O
enzyme O
possesses O
a O
novel O
residue O
substitution O
within O
a O
characteristic O
motif O
of O
the O
catalytic O
domain. O
Northern O
analysis O
of O
multiple O
human B-Species
tissue O
mRNAs O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
5.0 O
and O
2.1kb O
GalNAc-T8 B-Gene
transcripts O
are O
widely O
expressed. O
The O
metabolic B-Disease
disorder I-Disease
autosomal B-Disease
dominant I-Disease
hypophosphatemic I-Disease
rickets I-Disease
(ADHR) B-Disease
was O
previously O
mapped O
to O
the O
region O
of O
chromosome B-Chromosome
12p13.3 I-Chromosome
in O
which O
GalNAc-T8 B-Gene
resides. O
Using O
a O
positional-candidate O
strategy O
for O
identifying O
the O
ADHR B-Disease
gene, O
GalNAc-T8 B-Gene
was O
subjected O
to O
mutational O
analysis O
in O
DNA O
from O
ADHR B-Disease
individuals. O
We O
detected O
multiple O
polymorphisms O
in O
the O
human B-Species
GalNAc-T8 B-Gene
ORF, O
but O
did O
not O
find O
ADHR B-Disease
mutations. O
In O
summary, O
these O
studies O
identified O
the O
human B-Species
GalNAc-T8 B-Gene
gene, O
as O
well O
as O
multiple O
genomic O
polymorphisms O
that O
will O
be O
useful O
for O
further O
understanding O
the O
structure-function O
relations O
of O
the O
ppGaNTases. O
