# Abstract
Sartans O
are O
very O
effective O
drugs O
for O
treatment O
of O
hypertension, B-Disease
heart B-Disease
failure, I-Disease
and O
other O
cardiovascular B-Disease
disorders. I-Disease
They O
antagonize O
the O
effects O
of O
angiotensin B-Gene
II I-Gene
at O
the O
AT(1) O
receptor O
and O
display O
p.o. O
bioavailability O
rates O
of O
13 O
to O
80%. O
Because O
some O
sartans O
sterically O
resemble O
dipeptide B-Chemical
derivatives, O
we O
investigated O
whether O
they O
are O
transported O
by O
peptide O
transporters. O
We O
first O
assessed O
the O
effects O
of O
sartans O
on O
[(14)C]glycylsarcosine B-Chemical
uptake O
into O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
expressing O
H(+) B-Gene
peptide I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
(PEPT) I-Gene
1 I-Gene
and O
into O
SKPT B-CellLine
cells O
expressing O
PEPT2. B-Gene
Losartan, B-Chemical
irbesartan, B-Chemical
valsartan, O
and O
eprosartan B-Chemical
inhibited O
[glycine-1-(14)C]glycylsarcosine B-Chemical
([(14)C]Gly-Sar) B-Chemical
uptake O
into O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
in O
a O
competitive O
manner O
with O
K(i) O
values O
of O
24, O
230, O
390, O
and O
>1000 O
microM. O
Losartan B-Chemical
and O
valsartan O
also O
strongly O
inhibited O
the O
total O
transepithelial O
flux O
of O
[(14)C]Gly-Sar B-Chemical
across O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cell O
monolayers. O
In O
SKPT B-CellLine
cells, O
[(14)C]Gly-Sar B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
inhibited O
with O
K(i) O
values O
of O

We O
determined O
by O
the O
two-electrode O
voltage-clamp O
technique O
whether O
the O
compounds O
elicited O
transport O
currents O
by O
PEPT1 B-Gene
or O
PEPT2 B-Gene
when O
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes. O
No O
currents O
were O
observed O
for O
any O
of O
the O
sartans, O
but O
the O
compounds O
strongly O
and O
reversibly O
inhibited O
peptide-induced O
currents. O
Uptake O
of O
valsartan, O
losartan, B-Chemical
and O
cefadroxil B-Chemical
was O
quantified O
in O
HeLa B-CellLine
cells O
after O
heterologous O
expression O
of O
human B-Species
PEPT1 B-Gene
(hPEPT1). B-Gene
In O
contrast O
to O
cefadroxil, B-Chemical
no O
PEPT1-specific O
uptake O
of O
valsartan O
and O
losartan B-Chemical
was O
found. O
We O
conclude O
that O
the O
sartans O
tested O
in O
this O
study O
display O
high-affinity O
interaction O
with O
PEPTs O
but O
are O
not O
transported O
themselves. O
However, O
they O
strongly O
inhibit O
hPEPT1-mediated O
uptake O
of O
dipeptides B-Chemical
and O
cefadroxil. B-Chemical
