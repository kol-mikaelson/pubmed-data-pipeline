# Abstract
Hereditary B-Disease
multiple I-Disease
exostoses, I-Disease
a O
dominantly O
inherited O
genetic B-Disease
disorder I-Disease
characterized O
by O
multiple O
cartilaginous B-Disease
tumors, I-Disease
is O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
members O
of O
the O
EXT B-Gene
gene O
family, O
EXT1 B-Gene
or O
EXT2. B-Gene
The O
proteins O
encoded O
by O
these O
genes, O
EXT1 B-Gene
and O
EXT2, B-Gene
are O
endoplasmic O
reticulum-localized O
type O
II O
transmembrane O
glycoproteins O
that O
possess O
or O
are O
tightly O
associated O
with O
glycosyltransferase O
activities O
involved O
in O
the O

of O
heparan B-Chemical

Here, O
by O
testing O
a O
cell O

with O
a O
specific O
defect O
in O
EXT1 B-Gene
in O
in O
vivo O
and O
in O

assays, O
we O
show O
that O
EXT2 B-Gene
does O
not O
harbor O
significant O
glycosyltransferase O
activity O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
EXT1. B-Gene
Instead, O
it O
appears O
that O
EXT1 B-Gene
and O
EXT2 B-Gene
form O
a O
hetero-oligomeric O
complex O
in O
vivo O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
accumulation O
of O
both O
proteins O
in O
the O
Golgi O
apparatus. O
Remarkably, O
the O
Golgi-localized O
EXT1 B-Gene
EXT2 B-Gene
complex O
possesses O
substantially O
higher O
glycosyltransferase O
activity O
than O
EXT1 B-Gene
or O
EXT2 B-Gene
alone, O
which O
suggests O
that O
the O
complex O
represents O
the O
biologically O
relevant O
form O
of O
the O
enzyme(s). O
These O
findings O
provide O
a O
rationale O
to O
explain O
how O
inherited O
mutations O
in O
either O
of O
the O
two O
EXT B-Gene
genes O
can O
cause O
loss O
of O
activity, O
resulting O
in O
