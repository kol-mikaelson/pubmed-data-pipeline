# Abstract
1. O
Pitavastatin B-Chemical
is O
a O
potent O
competitive O
inhibitor O
of O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
little O
metabolized O
in O
hepatic O
microsomes. O
Pitavastatin B-Chemical
lactone, I-Chemical
which O
can O
be O
converted O
back O
to O
the O
unchanged O
form, O
is O
the O
major O
metabolite O
of O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
in O
humans. B-Species
To O

2. O
On O
addition O
of O
UDP-glucuronic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
human B-Species
hepatic O
microsomes O
produced O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
lactone I-Chemical
and O
an O
unknown O
metabolite O
(UM-2). B-Chemical
UM-2 B-Chemical
was O
converted O
to O
its O
unchanged O
form O
by O
enzymatic O
hydrolysis O
and O
to O
a O
lactone B-Chemical
form O
non-enzymatically. O
Using O
several O
human B-Species
UGT-expressing O
microsomes, O
UGT1A3 B-Gene
and O
UGT2B7 B-Gene
were O
principally O
responsible O
for O
glucuronidation O
of O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
leading O
to O
lactonization. O
3. O
No O
marked O

4. O
Pitavastatin B-Chemical

5. O
The O
mechanism O
of O
pitavastatin B-Chemical

has O
been O
clarified, O
in O
that O
glucuronidation O

by O
lactonization O
