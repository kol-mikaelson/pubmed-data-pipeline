# Abstract
L-selectin, O
a O
lectin-like O
receptor, O
mediates O
rolling O
of O
lymphocytes O
on O
high O
endothelial O
venules O
(HEVs) O
in O
secondary O
lymphoid O
organs O
by O
interacting O
with O
HEV B-Species
ligands. O
These O
ligands O
consist O
of O
a O
complex O
of O
sialomucins, O
candidates O
for O
which O
are O
glycosylation- B-Gene
dependent I-Gene
cell I-Gene
adhesion I-Gene
molecule I-Gene
1 I-Gene
(GlyCAM-1), B-Gene
CD34, B-Gene
and O
podocalyxin. O
The O
ligands O
must O
be O
sialylated, O
fucosylated, O
and O
sulfated O
for O
optimal O
recognition O
by O
L-selectin. O
Our O
previous O
structural O
characterization O
of O
GlyCAM-1 B-Gene
has O
demonstrated O
two O
sulfation O
modifications, O
Gal-6-sulfate B-Chemical
and O
GlcNAc-6-sulfate B-Chemical
in O
the O
context O
of O
sialyl O
Lewis O
x. O
We O
now O
report O
the O
cloning O
of O
a O
Gal-6-sulfotransferase O
and O
a O
GlcNAc-6-sulfotransferase, O
which O
can O
modify O
GlyCAM-1 B-Gene
and O
CD34. B-Gene
The O
Gal-6-sulfotransferase O
shows O
a O
wide O
tissue O
distribution. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
GlcNAc-6-sulfotransferase O
is O
highly O
restricted O
to O
HEVs, O
as O
revealed O
by O
Northern O
analysis O
and O
in O
situ O
hybridization. O
Expression O
of O
either O
enzyme O
in O
Chinese O
hamster O

cells, O
along O
with O
CD34 B-Gene
and O
fucosyltransferase O

results O
in O
ligand O
activity, O
as O
detected O
by O
binding O
of O
an O
L-selectin O
IgM O
chimera. O
When O
coexpressed, O
the O
two O
sulfotransferases O
synergize O
to O
produce O
strongly O
enhanced O
chimera O
binding. O
