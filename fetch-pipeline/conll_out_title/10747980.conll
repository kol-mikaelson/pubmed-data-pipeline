# Abstract
Poly-N-acetyllactosamines B-Chemical
are O
attached O
to O
N-glycans, B-Chemical
O-glycans, B-Chemical
and O
glycolipids B-Chemical
and O
serve O
as O
underlying O
glycans B-Chemical
that O
provide O
functional O
oligosaccharides B-Chemical
such O
as O
sialyl O
Lewis(X). O
Poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl O
repeats O
are O
synthesized O
by O
the O
alternate O
addition O
of O
beta1,3-linked O
GlcNAc B-Chemical
and O
beta1,4-linked O
Gal B-Chemical
by O
i-extension O
enzyme O
(iGnT) B-Gene
and O
a O
member O
of O
the O
beta1,4-galactosyltransferase O
(beta4Gal-T) B-Gene
gene O
family. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
first O
found O
that O
poly-N-acetyllactosamines B-Chemical
in O
N-glycans B-Chemical
are O
most O
efficiently O
synthesized O
by O
beta4Gal-TI O
and O
iGnT. B-Gene
We O
also O
found O
that O
iGnT B-Gene
acts O
less O
efficiently O
on O
acceptors O
containing O
increasing O
numbers O
of O
N-acetyllactosamine B-Chemical
repeats, O
in O
contrast O
to O
beta4Gal-TI, O
which O
exhibits O
no O
significant O
change. O
In O
O-glycan B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
N-acetyllactosamine B-Chemical
extension O
of O
core O
4 O
branches O
was O
found O
to O
be O
synthesized O
most O
efficiently O
by O
iGnT B-Gene
and O
beta4Gal-TI, O
in O
contrast O
to O
core O
2 O
branch O
synthesis, O
which O
requires O
iGnT B-Gene
and O
beta4Gal-TIV. B-Gene
Poly-N-acetyllactosamine B-Chemical
extension O
of O
core O
4 O
branches O
is, O
however, O
less O
efficient O
than O
that O
of O
N-glycans B-Chemical
or O
core O
2 O
branches. O
Such O
inefficiency O
is O
apparently O
due O
to O
competition O
between O
a O
donor O
substrate O
and O
acceptor O
in O
both O
galactosylation O
and O
N-acetylglucosaminylation, O
since O
a O
core O
4-branched O
acceptor O
contains O
both O
Gal B-Chemical
and O
GlcNAc B-Chemical
terminals. O
These O
results, O
taken O
together, O
indicate O
that O
poly-N-acetyllactosamine B-Chemical
synthesis O
in O
N-glycans B-Chemical
and O
core B-Chemical
2- I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
core I-Chemical
4-branched I-Chemical
O-glycans I-Chemical
is O
achieved O
by O
iGnT B-Gene
and O
distinct O
members O
of O
the O
beta4Gal-T B-Gene
gene O
family. O
The O
results O
also O
exemplify O
intricate O
interactions O
between O
acceptors O
and O
specific O
glycosyltransferases, O
which O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
how O
poly-N-acetyllactosamines B-Chemical
are O
synthesized O
in O
different O
acceptor O
molecules. O
