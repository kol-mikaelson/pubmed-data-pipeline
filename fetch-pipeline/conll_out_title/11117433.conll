Molecular O
studies O

the O

patients B-Species

reveal O
significant O

raising O
the O
possibility O
that O

constitute O
at O

one O

the O
biochemical O
and O
clinical O

observed. O
Previously O
we O
have O
identified O
a O
single O

mutation, O
V94M, B-ProteinMutation
present O
in O
the O
homozygous O

We O
report O
here O
further O
studies O
of O
the O
V94M-hGALE O
enzyme, O
overexpressed O
and O
purified O
from O

Our O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
mutant O
protein O
is O
impaired O
relative O
to O
the O
wild-type O
enzyme O
predominantly O
at O
the O
level O
of O
Vmax O
rather O
than O
of O
Km. O
Studies O
using O
UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine B-Chemical
as O
a O
competitor O
of O
UDPgalactose B-Chemical
further O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
Km O
values O
for O
these O
two O
substrates O
vary O
by O
less O
than O
a O
factor O
of O
3 O
for O
both O
the O
wild-type O
and O

proteins. O
Finally, O
we O
have O
explored O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
V94M B-ProteinMutation
substitution O
on O
susceptibility O
of O
yeast B-Species

We O
have O
observed O

We O
have O
further O
observed O
an O
inverse O
correlation O
between O
the O
level O
of O
GALE B-Gene
activity O
expressed O
in O
a O
culture O
and O
the O
concentration O

gal-1-P B-Chemical

the O

These O
data O
support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
elevated O
levels O
of O
gal-1-P B-Chemical
may O
underlie O
the O
observed O
toxicity. B-Disease
They O
further O
raise O
the O
intriguing O
possibility O
that O
yeast B-Species
may O
provide O
a O
valuable O
model O
not O
only O
for O
assessing O
the O
impact O
of O

on O

also O
for O

the O
metabolic O
