4 O
human B-Species

the O
total O
radioactivity O
is O
mainly O
excreted O
via O
the O
kidneys. O
Nearly O
90% O
are O
excreted O
within O
24 O
h. O
Main O
urinary O
metabolite O
is O
the O
conjugated O
1-hydroxymethyl O
derivative, O
which O
amounts O
to O
60-70% O
of O
the O
administered O
dose O
within O
24 O
h. O
Compared O
to O
total O
radioactivity, O
levels O
of O
unchanged O
drug O
in O
plasma O
are O
rather O
low O
and O
differ O
from O
one O
subject O
to O
the O
next. O
Most O
of O
the O
plasma O
radioactivity O
consists O
of O
the O
1-hydroxymethyl O
compound, O
most O
of O
it O
in O
conjugated O
form. O
Levels O
of O
free O
metabolite O
are O
lower O
than O
those O
of O
unchanged O
drug. O
Radioactivity O
is O
rapidly O
eliminated O
from O
plasma. O
The O
results O
of O
the O
present O
oral O
study O
seem O
to O
indicate O
significant O
first-pass O
metabolism. O
