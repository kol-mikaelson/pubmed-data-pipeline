of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
elucidate O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
an O
HMG-CoA B-Gene

inhibitor, O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
(an O
organic B-Chemical

a O
pKa O

was O
transported O
in O
the O
secretory O
and O
absorptive O

METHODS: O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
were O
grown O
on O
polycarbonate O

(Costar). O
The O

(NaviCyte) O
and O
an O

The O
apical O

RESULTS: O
Polarized O
permeation O

atorvastatin B-Chemical
was O
observed O
with O
the O
basolateral-to-apical O
(B-to-A) O

7-fold O
greater O

the O
A-to-B O
permeability O
(35.6 O

The O
secretion O
of O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
was O
a O

The O
B-to-A O

Furthermore, O
both O

and O
verapamil B-Chemical
significantly O
increased O
the O
A-to-B O
permeability O

atorvastatin B-Chemical
by O
60%; O
however, O
UIC2 B-Chemical
did O
not O
affect O
the O
A-to-B O

CsA B-Chemical
uncompetitively O
inhibited O
the O
B-to-A O

In O
addition, O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
(100 O

The O
apical O

atorvastatin B-Chemical
increased O
10.5-fold O
when O
the O
