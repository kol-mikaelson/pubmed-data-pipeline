# Abstract
Glycogen B-Disease
storage I-Disease
disease I-Disease
type I-Disease
lb I-Disease
(GSD-lb) B-Disease
is O
caused O
by O
deficiencies O
in O
the O
glucose-6-phosphate B-Gene
transporter I-Gene
(G6PT), B-Gene
which O
works O
together O
with O
glucose-6-phosphatase B-Gene
to O
maintain O
glucose B-Chemical
homeostasis. O
In O
humans, B-Species
there O
are O
two O
alternatively O
spliced O
transcripts, O
G6PT B-Gene
and O
variant O
G6PT B-Gene
(vG6PT), O
differing O
by O
the O
inclusion O
of O
a O
66-bp O
exon-7 O
sequence O
in O
vG6PT. O
We O
have O
previously O
shown O
that O
the O
G6PT B-Gene
protein O
functions O
as O
a O
microsomal O
glucose-6-phosphate O
(G6P) O
transporter, O
which O
is O
anchored O
to O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum O
by O
ten O
transmembrane O
helices. O
Here, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
vG6PT O
is O
also O
active O
in O
microsomal O
G6P O
transport. O
The O
additional O
22 O
amino O
acids O
in O
vG6PT O
is O
predicted O
to O
constitute O
a O
part O
of O
the O
luminal O
loop O
4. O
Our O
data O
indicate O
that O
this O
loop O
plays O
no O
vital O
role O
in O
microsomal O
G6P O
transport. O
Further, O
we O
show O
that O
G6PT B-Gene
mRNA O
is O
expressed O
in O
all O
organs O
and O
tissues O
examined, O
but O
that O
the O
vG6PT O
transcript O
is O
expressed O
exclusively O
in O
the O
brain, O
heart, O
and O
skeletal O
muscle. O
These O
results O
raise O
the O
possibility O
that O
mutations O
in O
exon-7 O
of O
the O
G6PT B-Gene
gene, O
which O
would O
not O
perturb O
glucose B-Chemical
homeostasis, O
might O
have O
other O
deleterious O
effects. O
