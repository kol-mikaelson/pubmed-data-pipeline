# Abstract
X-linked B-Disease

human B-Species

The O
bare O

(Bpa) O

(Str) O
mouse B-Species
mutations O
were O
originally O
identified O
in O
female O
offspring O
of O
X-irradiated O
males. O
Subsequently, O
additional O
independent O
alleles O
were O
described. O
We O
have O
previously O
mapped O
these O
X-linked O

male-lethal O
mutations O
to O
an O

Here O
we O
report O
mutations O

one O

these O
genes, O
Nsdhl, B-Gene

an O

a O

Our O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
Bpa O

Str O
are O
allelic O
mutations O
and O
identify O
the O
first O
mammalian O

They O
