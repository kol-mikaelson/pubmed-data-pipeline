# Abstract
In O
the O
third O
step O
of O
the O
alpha-oxidation O
of O
3-methyl-branched B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
such O
as O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
a O
2-hydroxy-3-methylacyl-CoA B-Chemical
is O
cleaved O
into O
formyl-CoA B-Chemical
and O
a O
2-methyl-branched B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
aldehyde. I-Chemical
The O

enzyme O

purified O
from O
the O

protein O

and O
identified O

a O

made O
up O
of O
four O

of O

Formyl-CoA B-Chemical

when O

incubated O
with O
2-hydroxy-3-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA B-Chemical

Hence O
the O

Sequences O

The O

the O
human B-Species
lyase O
contained O
an O
ORF O
of O
1,734 O

that O

Recombinant O
human B-Species

mammalian O
cells, O
exhibited O
lyase O
activity. O
The O
lyase O

homology O
to O
a O
putative O
Caenorhabditis B-Species

protein O
that O
resembles O
bacterial O
oxalyl-CoA O
decarboxylases. O
Similarly O

decarboxylases, O
a O
thiamine O

present O
in O
