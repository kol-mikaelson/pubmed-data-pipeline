Intestinal O

transport. O

# Abstract
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
review O
is O
to O
update O
the O
reader O
on O
our O
current O
knowledge O
of O
the O
digestion, O
uptake, O
and O
transport O
of O
dietary O
lipid. B-Chemical
In O
particular, O
it O
discusses O
how O
intestinal O
lipid B-Chemical
transporters O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
uptake O
of O
lipids B-Chemical
by O
the O
enterocytes, O
and O
how O
chylomicrons O
are O
formed O
in O
the O
enterocytes O
and O
packaged O
for O
export O
into O
the O
lymphatic O
system O
through O
exocytosis. O
The O
classification O
and O
properties O
of O
lipids B-Chemical
is O
first O
described O
followed O
by O
a O
discussion O
of O
structured O
lipids B-Chemical
and O
their O
role O
in O
human B-Species
nutrition. O
Digestion O
of O
triacylglycerols B-Chemical
takes O
place O
in O
the O
stomach O
aided O
by O
the O
enzyme O
gastric B-Gene
lipase. I-Gene
The O
origin O
and O
properties O
of O
lingual O
and O
gastric B-Gene
lipase I-Gene
are O
reviewed. O
Most O
digestion O
of O
triacylglycerols B-Chemical
by O
pancreatic B-Gene
lipase I-Gene
occurs O
in O
the O
intestinal O
lumen. O
Similarly, O
digestion O
of O
cholesteryl B-Chemical
ester I-Chemical
and O
phospholipids B-Chemical
also O
takes O
place O
in O
the O
intestinal O
lumen. O
This O
review O
describes O
in O
considerable O
detail O
the O
uptake O
of O
lipid B-Chemical
digestion O
products O
by O
the O
enterocytes, O
particularly O
the O
role O
of O
recently O
identified O
lipid B-Chemical
transporters. O
The O
intracellular O
trafficking O
and O
the O
resynthesis O
of O
complex O
lipids B-Chemical
from O
the O
lipid B-Chemical
digestion O
products O
are O
talked O
about, O
particularly O
within O
the O
context O
of O
the O
recently O
generated O
knockout O
mouse B-Species
that O
lacks O
the O
key O
lipid B-Chemical
reesterification O
enzymes. O
Finally, O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
formation O
and O
secretion O
of O
chylomicrons O
is O
described O
and O
clinical O
disorders O
discussed. O
