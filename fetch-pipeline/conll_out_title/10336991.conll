# Abstract
Chitobiase B-Gene
is O
a O
lysosomal O
glycosidase O
that O
acts O
during O
the O
ordered O
degradation O
of O
asparagine-linked O
glycoproteins O
to O
cleave O
the O
core O
chitobiose B-Chemical
unit O
at O
its O
reducing O
end. O
Human B-Species
chitobiase B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
significant O
amounts, O
while O
bovine B-Species
chitobiase B-Gene
is O
produced O
at O
extremely O
low O
levels. O
To O
begin O
to O
understand O
this O
species-dependent O
expression, O
we O
determined O
the O
gene O
structure O
of O
human B-Species
chitobiase. B-Gene
The O
human B-Species
chitobiase B-Gene
gene O
( O
CTB B-Gene
S) I-Gene
is O
approximately O
20 O
kb O
comprising O
seven O
exons O
varying O
from O
0.1 O
to O
2.3 O
kb O
and O
six O
introns O
of O
0.3 O
to O
8 O
kb. O
The O
previously O
characterized O
partial O
bovine B-Species
chitobiase B-Gene
gene O
structure O
is O
similarly O
organized O
including O
exon O
and O
intron O
sizes O
and O
locations, O
but O
the O
human B-Species
and O
bovine B-Species
5'-flanking O
regions O
differ O
significantly. O
5'-RACE O
analysis O
of O
human B-Species
chitobiase B-Gene
cDNA O
revealed O
only O
one O
transcriptional O
start O
site O
45 O
bp O
upstream O
of O
the O
ATG O
translation O
initiation O
site. O
Computer O
analysis O
of O
the O
human B-Species
chitobiase B-Gene
gene O
5'-flanking O
region O
shows O
characteristics O
of O
a O
typical O
housekeeping O
gene. O
The O
putative O
promoter O
region O
contains O
a O
distal O
TATA O
box, O
and O
there O
are O
several O
Sp-1 O
and O
AP-2 B-Gene
cis O
elements. O
In O
contrast, O
bovine B-Species
chitobiase B-Gene
gene O
5'-flanking O
region O
shows O
totally O
different O
structures O
and O
may O
contain O
several O
silencers. O
A O
partial O
art-2 O
segment O
which O
is O
an O
artiodactyl O
Alu O
-like O
repetitive O
sequence, O
is O
also O
present. O
These O
evolutionary O
differences O
in O
the O
5'-flanking O
region O
of O
the O
chitobiase B-Gene
genes O
from O
human B-Species
and O
bovine B-Species
could O
account O
for O
the O
widely O
varied O
expression O
levels O
of O
the O
hydrolase O
within O
these O
two O
species. O
