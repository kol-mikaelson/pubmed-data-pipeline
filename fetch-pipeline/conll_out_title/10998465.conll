# Abstract
Studies O
considering O
long-term O
squalene B-Chemical
consumption O
have O
revealed O
no O
consistent O
effects O
on O
serum O
cholesterol B-Chemical
levels O
but O
the O
immediate O
effect O
of O
dietary O
squalene B-Chemical
on O
cholesterol B-Chemical
synthesis O
has O
not O
been O
studied. O
Thus, O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
single O
dose O
of O
dietary O
squalene B-Chemical
on O
postprandial O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism O
was O
studied O
in O
16 O
male O
volunteeers O
aged O
22-79 O
years. O
Two O
oral O

a O

were O
administered O
to O
every O
subject, O
one O
without O
(control) O
and O
the O
other O
with O
500 O
mg O
of O
squalene. B-Chemical
Lipids, B-Chemical

non-cholesterol O

and, O
in O
six O
randomly O
chosen O
subjects, O
also O
in O
IDL, O
LDL O
and O
HDL. O
In O
the O
fasting O
samples, O
squalene B-Chemical
was O
mainly O
transported O
in O
LDL O
and O
HDL, O
whereas O
in O
squalene-supplemented O
postprandium O
most O
of O
squalene B-Chemical
was O
carried O
in O
the O
triglyceride-rich O
lipoproteins. O
Postprandial O
squalene B-Chemical
and O
retinyl B-Chemical
palmitate I-Chemical
curves O
closely O
resembled O
each O
other. O
After O
the O
squalene-enriched O
dietary O
fat O
load, O
squalene B-Chemical
was O
significantly O
increased O
compared O
to O
control O
fat O
loads O
in O
plasma, O
chylomicrons, O
VLDL O
and O
IDL. O
Squalene B-Chemical

increased O

and O
VLDL O

and O
increased O
significantly O

indicating O
enhanced O
cholesterol B-Chemical

In O
conclusion, O
a O
single O
oral O

of O
squalene B-Chemical
representing O
a O
potential O
