# Abstract
Activation O
of O
calpain O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
occur O
in O
some O
contexts O
of O
cell O
injury O
and O
to O
be O
essential O
for O
loss O
of O
cell O
viability. O
Part O
of O
this O
may O
be O
mediated O
at O
the O
mitochondrial O
level. O
It O
has O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
calpain O
activity O
is O
necessary O
for O
the O
complete O
discharge O
of O
apoptosis-inducing O
factor O
from O
the O
mitochondrial O
intermembrane O
space O
and O
can O
cause O
the O

of O

Bid B-Gene
to O
a O

In O

identify O
acyl-CoA-binding B-Gene

as O
playing O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
the O
activation O
of O
