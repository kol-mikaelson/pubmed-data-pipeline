# Abstract
Heterodimeric O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
are O
comprised O
of O
two O
subunits, O
a O
polytopic O
membrane O
protein O
(light O
chain) O
and O
an O
associated O
type B-Gene
II I-Gene
membrane I-Gene
protein I-Gene
(heavy O
chain). O
The O
heavy O
chain O
rbAT B-Gene
(related O
to O
b(0,+) O
amino O
acid O
transporter) O
associates O
with O
the O
light O
chain O
b(0,+)AT O
(b(0,+) O
amino O
acid O
transporter) O
to O
form O
the O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
b(0,+), O
whereas O
the O
homologous O
heavy O
chain O
4F2hc B-Gene
interacts O
with O
several O
light O
chains O
to O
form O
system O
L O
(with O
LAT1 B-Gene
and O
LAT2), B-Gene
system O
y(+)L O
(with O
y(+)LAT1 O
and O
y(+)LAT2), O
system O
x O
(with O
xAT), O
or O
system O
asc O
(with O
asc1). B-Gene
The O
association O
of O
light O
chains O
with O
the O
two O
heavy O
chains O
is O
not O
unambiguous. O
rbAT B-Gene
may O
interact O
with O
LAT2 B-Gene
and O
y(+)LAT1 O
and O
vice O
versa; O
4F2hc B-Gene
may O
interact O
with O
b(0,+)AT O
when O
overexpressed. O
4F2hc B-Gene
is O
necessary O
for O
trafficking O
of O
the O
light O
chain O
to O
the O
plasma O
membrane, O
whereas O
the O
light O
chains O
are O
thought O
to O
determine O
the O
transport O
characteristics O
of O
the O
respective O
heterodimer. O
In O
contrast O
to O
4F2hc, B-Gene
mutations O
in O
rbAT B-Gene
suggest O
that O
rbAT B-Gene
itself O
takes O
part O
in O
the O
transport O
besides O
serving O
for O
the O
trafficking O
of O
the O
light O
chain O
to O
the O
cell O
surface. O
Heavy O
and O
light O
subunits O
are O
linked O
together O
by O
a O
disulfide B-Chemical
bridge. O
The O
disulfide B-Chemical
bridge, O
however, O
is O
not O
necessary O
for O
the O
trafficking O
of O
rbAT B-Gene
or O
4F2 B-Gene
heterodimers O
to O
the O
membrane O
or O
for O
the O
functioning O
of O
the O
transporter. O
However, O
there O
is O
experimental O
evidence O
that O
the O
disulfide B-Chemical
bridge O
in O
the O
4F2hc B-Gene
LAT1 B-Gene
heterodimer O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
a O
cation O
channel. O
These O
results O
highlight O
complex O
interactions O
between O
the O
different O
subunits O
of O
heterodimeric O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
and O
suggest O
that O
despite O
high O
grades O
of O
homology, O
the O
interactions O
between O
rbAT B-Gene
and O
4F2hc B-Gene
and O
their O
respective O
partners O
may O
be O
different. O
