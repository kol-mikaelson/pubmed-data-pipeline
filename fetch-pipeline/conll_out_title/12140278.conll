# Abstract
Quinolinate B-Chemical
(quinolinic B-Chemical
acid) I-Chemical
is O
a O
potent O
endogenous O
excitotoxin O
of O
neuronal O
cells. O
Elevation O
of O
quinolinate B-Chemical
levels O
in O
the O
brain O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
various O
neurodegenerative B-Disease
disorders, I-Disease
the O
so-called O
"quinolinate B-Chemical
hypothesis." O
Quinolinate B-Chemical
is O
non-enzymatically O
derived O
from O
alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde O
(ACMS). B-Chemical
Alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde O
decarboxylase O
(ACMSD) B-Gene
is O
the O
only O
known O
enzyme O
that O
can O
process O
ACMS B-Chemical
to O
a O
benign O
catabolite O
and O
thus O
prevent O
the O
accumulation O
of O
quinolinate B-Chemical
from O
ACMS. B-Chemical
ACMSD B-Gene
seems O
to O
be O
regulated O
by O
nutritional O
and O
hormonal O
signals, O
but O
its O
molecular O
mechanism O
has, O
to O
date, O
been O
largely O
unknown. O
Utilizing O
partial O
amino O
acid O
sequences O
obtained O
from O
highly O
purified O
porcine O
kidney O
ACMSD, B-Gene
a O
cDNA O
encoding O
human B-Species
ACMSD B-Gene
was O
cloned O
and O
characterized. O
The O
cDNA O
encodes O
a O
unique O
open O
reading O
frame O
of O
336 O
amino O
acids O
and O
displays O
little O
homology O
to O
any O
known O
enzymes O
or O
motifs O
in O
mammalian O
databases, O
suggesting O
that O
ACMSD B-Gene
may O
contain O
a O
new O
kind O
of O
protein O
fold. O
Real-time O
PCR-based O
quantification O
of O
ACMSD B-Gene
revealed O
very O
low O
but O
significant O
levels O
of O
the O
expression O
in O
the O
brain. O
Brain O
ACMSD B-Gene
messages O
were O
down- O
and O
up-regulated O
in O
response O
to O
low O
protein O
diet O
and O
streptozocin-induced O
diabetes, B-Disease
respectively. O
The O
enzyme O
activities O
measured O
from O
partially O
purified O
brains O
were O
closely O
correlated O
with O
the O
changes O
in O
the O
message O
levels. O
Expression O
of O
quinolinate B-Chemical
phosphoribosyltransferase I-Gene
(QPRT), B-Gene
another O
enzyme O
that O
catabolizes O
quinolinate, B-Chemical
was O
also O
found O
in O
the O
brain. O
This O
suggests O
that O
a O
pathway O
does O
exist O
by O
which O
the O
levels O
of O
quinolinate B-Chemical
in O
the O
brain O
are O
regulated. O
In O
this O
report, O
we O
address O
the O
molecular O
basis O
underlying O
quinolinate B-Chemical
metabolism O
and O
the O
regulation O
of O
ACMSD B-Gene
expression. O
