Identification O

novel O
Na+ O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
cotransporter. O

# Abstract
rkST1, O
an O
orphan O
cDNA O
of O
the O
SLC5 O
family O
(43% O
identical O
in O
sequence O
to O
the O
sodium O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
cotransporter O
SMIT), B-Gene
was O
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
that O
were O
subsequently O
voltage-clamped O
and O
exposed O
to O
likely O
substrates. O
Whereas O
superfusion O
with O
glucose B-Chemical
and O
other O
sugars B-Chemical
produced O
a O
small O
inward O
current, O
the O
largest O
current O
was O
observed O
with O
myo-inositol. B-Chemical
The O
expressed O
protein, O
which O
we O
have O
named O
SMIT2, B-Gene
cotransports O
myo-inositol B-Chemical
with O
a O
K(m) O
of O
120 O
microm O
and O
displays O
a O
current-voltage O
relationship O
similar O
to O
that O
seen O
with O
SMIT B-Gene
(now O
called O
SMIT1). B-Gene
The O
transport O
is O
Na(+)-dependent, O
with O
a O
K(m) O
of O
13 O
mm. O
SMIT2 B-Gene
exhibits O
phlorizin-inhibitable O
presteady-state O
currents O
and O
substrate-independent O
"Na(+) O
leak" O
currents O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
related O
cotransporters. O
The O
steady-state O
cotransport O
current O
is O
also O
phlorizin-inhibitable O
with O
a O
K(i) O
of O
76 O
microm. O
SMIT2 B-Gene
exhibits O
stereospecific O
cotransport O
of O
both O
d-glucose B-Chemical
and O
d-xylose B-Chemical
but O
does O
not O
transport O
fucose. B-Chemical
In O
addition, O
SMIT2 B-Gene
(but O
not O
SMIT1) B-Gene
transports O
d-chiro-inositol. B-Chemical
Based O
on O
previous O
publications, O
the O
tissue O
distribution O
of O
SMIT2 B-Gene
is O
different O
from O
that O
of O
SMIT1, B-Gene
and O
the O
existence O
of O
this O
second O
cotransporter O
may O
explain O
much O
of O
the O
heterogeneity O
that O
has O
been O
reported O
for O
inositol O
transport. O
