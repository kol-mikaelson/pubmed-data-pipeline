# Abstract
Studies O
involving O
the O
cloning O
and O
disruption O
of O
the O
gene O
for O
acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol B-Gene
acyltransferase I-Gene
(DGAT) B-Gene
have O
shown O
that O
alternative O
mechanisms O
exist O
for O
triglyceride B-Chemical
synthesis. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
cloned O
and O
characterized O
a O
second O
mammalian O
DGAT, B-Gene
DGAT2, B-Gene
which O
was O
identified O
by O
its O
homology O
to O
a O
DGAT B-Gene
in O
the O
fungus O
Mortierella B-Species
rammaniana. I-Species
DGAT2 B-Gene
is O
a O
member O
of O
a O
gene O
family O
that O
has O
no O
homology O
with O
DGAT1 B-Gene
and O
includes O
several O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
homologues O
that O
are O
candidates O
for O
additional O
DGAT B-Gene
genes. O
The O
expression O
of O
DGAT2 B-Gene
in O
insect O
cells O
stimulated O
triglyceride B-Chemical
synthesis O
6-fold O
in O
assays O
with O
cellular O
membranes, O
and O
DGAT2 B-Gene
activity O
was O
dependent O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acyl-CoA I-Chemical
and O
diacylglycerol, B-Chemical
indicating O
that O
this O
protein O
is O
a O
DGAT. B-Gene
Activity O
was O
not O
observed O
for O
acyl O
acceptors O
other O
than O
diacylglycerol. B-Chemical
DGAT2 B-Gene
activity O
was O
inhibited O
by O
a O
high O
concentration O
(100 O
mm) O
of O
MgCl(2) B-Chemical
in O
an O
in O
vitro O
assay, O
a O
characteristic O
that O
distinguishes O
DGAT2 B-Gene
from O
DGAT1. B-Gene
DGAT2 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
in O
many O
tissues O
with O
high O
expression O
levels O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
white O
adipose O
tissue, O
suggesting O
that O
it O
may O
play O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
mammalian O
triglyceride B-Chemical
metabolism. O
