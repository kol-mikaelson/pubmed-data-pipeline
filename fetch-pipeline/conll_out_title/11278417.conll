# Abstract
Uridine O
phosphorylase O
(UPase), B-Gene
a O
key O
enzyme O
in O
the O
pyrimidine B-Chemical
salvage O
pathway, O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
intermediate O
filament O
protein O
vimentin, B-Gene

NIH B-CellLine
3T3 I-CellLine
fibroblasts I-CellLine
and O

cells. O
Affinity O

utilized O
to O
purify O
UPase B-Gene
from O

Vimentin B-Gene
copurification O
with O
UPase B-Gene
was O
confirmed O
using O
both O
Western O
blot O
analysis O
and O
MALDI-MS O
methods. O
Separation O
of O
cytosolic O
proteins O
using O
gel O
filtration O
chromatography O
yields O
a O
high O
molecular O
weight O
complex O
containing O
UPase B-Gene
and O
vimentin. B-Gene
Purified O
recombinant O
UPase B-Gene

recombinant O
vimentin B-Gene
were O
shown O
to O
bind O
in O

with O
an O
affinity O

120 O
pm O
and O
a O
stoichiometry O
of O
1:2. O
Immunofluorescence O
techniques O
confirm O
that O
UPase B-Gene
is O
associated O
with O
vimentin B-Gene
in O
both O
NIH B-CellLine

Our O
data O
demonstrate O
that O
UPase B-Gene
is O
associated O
with O
both O
the O
soluble O
and O
insoluble O
pools O
of O
vimentin. B-Gene
Approximately O
60-70% O
of O
the O
total O
UPase B-Gene
exists O
in O
the O
cytosol O
as O
a O
soluble O
protein. O

All O
pools O
of O
UPase B-Gene
have O
been O
shown O
to O
possess O
enzymatic O
activity. O
We O
demonstrate O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
UPase B-Gene
is O
associated O
with O
vimentin B-Gene

the O
existence O
