# Abstract
Lipoxins O
and O
other O
eicosanoids B-Chemical
display O
potent O
and O
selective O
biological O
effects O
on O
leukocytes. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
utilized O
radiolabeled O
lipoxin B-Chemical
A4 I-Chemical
([3H]LXA4) B-Chemical
to O
investigate O
whether O
carrier-mediated O
transport O
of O
LXA4 B-Chemical
might O
occur O
in O
human B-Species
neutrophils. O
At O
a O
concentration O
of O
5 O
nM, O
uptake O
of O
[3H]LXA4, B-Chemical
above O
that O
due O
to O
specific O
binding O
to O
receptors, O
amounted O
to O
approximately O
0.6 O
fmol.10(6) O

This O
influx O
was O
sensitive O
to O
a O

of O
anionic O

including O
3,5-diiodosalicylic B-Chemical

and O
p-hydroxy-mercuribenzoate. B-Chemical
Influx, O
which O
was O

exhibited O
a O
striking O

results O
compatible O
with O
an O

The O
LXA4 B-Chemical

did O
not O
appear O
to O

with O
arachidonic B-Chemical

Moreover, O
transport O

was O
not O
observed O
in O
human B-Species
erythrocytes, O
lymphocytes, O
or O
platelets, O
but O
it O
was O

acid. O
These O
findings O
represent O
the O
identification O
and O
initial O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
carrier-mediated O
pathway O
in O
human B-Species
neutrophils O
that O
facilitates O
transport O
of O
LXA4 B-Chemical
into O
cells. O
