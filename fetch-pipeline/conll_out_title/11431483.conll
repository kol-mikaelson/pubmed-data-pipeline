# Abstract
epsilon-N-Trimethyllysine B-Chemical
hydroxylase O
(EC O
) O
is O
the O
first O
enzyme O
in O
the O
biosynthetic O
pathway O
of O
l-carnitine B-Chemical
and O
catalyzes O
the O
formation O
of O
beta-hydroxy-N-epsilon-trimethyllysine B-Chemical
from O
epsilon-N-trimethyllysine, B-Chemical
a O
reaction O
dependent O
on O
alpha-ketoglutarate, B-Chemical
Fe(2+), B-Chemical
and O
oxygen. B-Chemical
We O
purified O
the O
enzyme O
from O
rat B-Species
kidney O
and O
sequenced O
two O

by O
quadrupole-time-of-flight O

Using O
the O

confirmed O
that O
they O
encode O
epsilon-N-trimethyllysine B-Chemical
hydroxylase. O
Subcellular O

studies O
revealed O
that O
the O
rat B-Species
enzyme O
is O
localized O
exclusively O
in O
mitochondria. O
Expression O
studies O
in O
yeast B-Species
indicated O
that O
the O
rat B-Species
enzyme O
is O
synthesized O
as O
a O
47.5-kDa O

showed O
that O
the O
native O
enzyme O
has O
a O

approximately O
87 O
kDa, O
indicating O
that O
