Vitamin B-Chemical
E, I-Chemical
the O
most O

at O
the O

At O

eight O
vitamin B-Chemical
E I-Chemical

have O
been O
isolated O
from O

Since O
its O
discovery, O
mainly O
antioxidant O
and O
recently O
also O
cell O
signaling O
aspects O
of O
tocopherols B-Chemical
and O
tocotrienols B-Chemical
have O
been O
studied. O
Tocopherols B-Chemical
and O
tocotrienols B-Chemical
are O
part O
of O
an O
interlinking O
set O
of O
antioxidant O
cycles, O
which O
has O
been O
termed O
the O
antioxidant O
network. O
Although O
the O
antioxidant O
activity O
of O
tocotrienols B-Chemical
is O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
tocopherols, B-Chemical
tocotrienols B-Chemical
have O
a O
lower O
bioavailability O
after O
oral O
ingestion. O
Tocotrienols B-Chemical
penetrate O
rapidly O
through O
skin O
and O
efficiently O
combat O
oxidative O
stress O
induced O
by O
UV O
or O
ozone. B-Chemical
Tocotrienols B-Chemical
