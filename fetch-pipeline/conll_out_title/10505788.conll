# Abstract
Betaine B-Gene
aldehyde I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
has O
been O
purified O
to O
homogeneity O
from O
rat B-Species
liver O
mitochondria. O
The O
properties O
of O
betaine B-Gene
aldehyde I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
were O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
human B-Species
cytoplasmic O
E3 O
isozyme O
in O
substrate O
specificity O
and O
kinetic O
constants O
for O
substrates. O
The O
primary O
structure O
of O
four O
tryptic O
peptides O
was O
also O
similar; O
only O
two O
substitutions, O
at O
most, O
per O
peptide O
were O
observed. O
Thus, O
betaine B-Gene
aldehyde I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
is O
not O
a O
specific O
enzyme, O
as O
formerly O
believed; O
activity O
with O
betaine B-Chemical
aldehyde I-Chemical
is O
a O
property O
of O
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
(EC O
1.2.1.3), O
which O
has O
broad O
substrate O
specificity. O
Up O
to O
the O
present O
time O
the O
enzyme O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
cytoplasmic O
in O
mammals. O
This O
report O
establishes, O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
mitochondrial O
subcellular O
localization O
for O
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase, O
which O
dehydrogenates O
betaine B-Chemical
aldehyde, I-Chemical
and O
its O
colocalization O
with O
choline B-Chemical
dehydrogenase. I-Gene
Betaine B-Chemical
aldehyde I-Chemical
dehydrogenation O
is O
an O
important O
function O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
choline B-Chemical
to O
betaine, B-Chemical
a O
major O
osmolyte. O
Betaine B-Chemical
is O
also O
important O
in O
mammalian O
organisms O
as O
a O
major O
methyl O
group O
donor O
and O
nitrogen O
source. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
purification O
and O
characterization O
of O
mitochondrial O
betaine B-Gene
aldehyde I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
from O
any O
mammalian O
species. O
