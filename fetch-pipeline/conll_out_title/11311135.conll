# Abstract
Heterodimeric O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
are O
comprised O
of O
a O
type-II O
membrane O
protein O
named O
the O
heavy O
chain O
(4F2hc O
or O
rBAT) B-Gene
that O
may O
associate O
with O
a O
number O
of O
different O
polytopic O
membrane O
proteins, O
called O
light O
chains. O
It O
is O
thought O
that O
the O
heavy O
chain O
is O
mainly O
involved O
in O
the O
trafficking O
of O
the O
complex O
to O
the O
plasma O
membrane, O
whereas O
the O
transport O
process O
itself O
is O
catalysed O
by O
the O
light O
chain. O
The O
4F2 B-Gene
heavy O
chain O
(4F2hc) O
associates O
with O
at O
least O
six O
different O
light O
chains O
to O
induce O
distinct O
amino O
acid-transport O
activites. O
To O
test O
if O
the O
light O
chains O
are O
specifically O
recognized O
and O
to O
identify O
domains O
involved O
in O
the O
recognition O
of O
light O
chains, O
C-terminally O
truncated O
mutants O
of O
4F2hc O
were O
constructed O
and O
co-expressed O
with O
the O
light O
chains O
LAT1, B-Gene
LAT2 B-Gene
and O
y(+)LAT2. O
The O
truncated O
isoform O
T1, O
comprised O
of O
only O
133 O
amino O
acids O
that O
form O
the O
cytosolic O
N-terminus O
and O
the O
transmembrane O
helix, O
displayed O
only O
a O
slight O

in O
its O

wild-type O
4F2hc O

Co-expression O
of O

on O
LAT1 B-Gene
expression, O
surface O
expression O
of O
LAT2 B-Gene
and O
y(+)LAT2 O
was O
almost O
completely O
lost O
with O
all O
truncated O
heavy O
chains. O
Co-expression O
of O
LAT1 B-Gene
together O
with O
the O
other O
light O

did O
not O
result O
in O
displacement O
of O
LAT2 B-Gene
and O
y(+)LAT2. O
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
extracellular O
domains O
of O
the O
heavy O
chain O
are O
responsible O
mainly O
for O
recognition O
of O
light O
chains O
other O
than O
LAT1 B-Gene
and O
that O
the O
extracellular O
domain O
ensures O
proper O
