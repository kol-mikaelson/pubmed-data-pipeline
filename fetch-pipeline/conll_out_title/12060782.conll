# Abstract
Problem B-Disease
drug I-Disease
use I-Disease
and O
dependence O
are O
neurobehavioral B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
of O
complex O
origin. O
Although O
environmental O
factors O
contribute O
to O
drug B-Disease
abuse I-Disease
and O
addiction, B-Disease
genetic O
factors O
also O
play O
a O
significant O
role O
estimated O
at O
40-60% O
of O
the O
total O
risk. O
Nonetheless, O
the O
precise O
identities O
of O
human B-Species
genes O
that O
confer O
vulnerability O
to O
problem B-Disease
drug I-Disease
use I-Disease
remain O
mostly O
unknown. O
Here, O
we O
describe O
a O
natural O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphism O
in O
the O
human B-Species
gene O
that O
encodes O
the O
principal O
endocannabinoid-inactivating O
enzyme, O
fatty B-Gene
acid I-Gene
amide I-Gene
hydrolase I-Gene
(FAAH), B-Gene
that O
in O
homozygous O
form O
is O
strongly O
associated O
with O
both O
street O
drug O
use O
and O
problem O
drug O

This O
single O
nucleotide O
polymorphism O
results O
in O
a O
missense O
mutation O
(385C-->A) B-DNAMutation
that O
converts O
a O
conserved O
proline B-ProteinMutation
residue I-ProteinMutation
to I-ProteinMutation
threonine I-ProteinMutation
(Pro129-->Thr), B-ProteinMutation
producing O
a O
FAAH B-Gene
variant O
that O
displays O
normal O
catalytic O
properties O
but O
an O
enhanced O
sensitivity O
to O
proteolytic O
degradation. O
Collectively, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
genetic O
mutations O
in O
FAAH B-Gene
may O
constitute O
important O
risk O
factors O
for O
problem B-Disease

use I-Disease
and O

a O
