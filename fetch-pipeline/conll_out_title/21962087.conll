# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Metabolic O
network O
reconstructions O
formalize O
our O
knowledge O
of O
metabolism. O
Gaps O
in O
these O
networks O
pinpoint O
regions O
of O
metabolism O
where O
biological O
components O
and O
functions O
are O
"missing." O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
a O
major O
challenge O
in O
the O
post O
genomic O
era O
involves O
characterisation O
of O
missing O
biological O
components O
to O
complete O
genome O
annotation. O
RESULTS: O
We O
used O
the O
human B-Species
metabolic O
network O
reconstruction O
RECON O
1 O
and O
established O
constraint-based O
modelling O
tools O
to O
uncover O
novel O
functions O
associated O
with O
human B-Species
metabolism. O
Flux B-Chemical
variability O

identified O
175 O
gaps O
in O
RECON O
1 O
in O
the O
form O
of O
blocked O
reactions. O
These O
gaps O
were O
unevenly O
distributed O
within O
metabolic O
pathways O
but O
primarily O
found O
in O
the O
cytosol O
and O
often O
caused O
by O
compounds O
whose O
metabolic O
fate, O
rather O
than O
production, O
is O
unknown. O
Using O
a O
published O
algorithm, O
we O
computed O
gap-filling O
solutions O
comprised O
of O
non-organism O
specific O
metabolic O
reactions O
capable O
of O
bridging O
the O
identified O
gaps. O
These O
candidate O
solutions O
were O
found O
to O
be O
dependent O
upon O
the O
reaction O
environment O
of O
the O
blocked O
reaction. O
Importantly, O
we O
showed O
that O
automatically O
generated O
solutions O
could O
produce O
biologically O
realistic O
hypotheses O
of O
novel O
human B-Species
metabolic O
reactions O
such O
as O
of O
the O
fate O
of O
iduronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
following O
glycan B-Chemical
degradation O
and O
of O
N-acetylglutamate B-Chemical
in O
amino O
acid O
metabolism. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
results O
demonstrate O
how O
metabolic O
models O
can O
be O
utilised O
to O
direct O
hypotheses O
of O
novel O
metabolic O
functions O
in O
human B-Species
metabolism; O
a O
process O
that O
we O
find O
is O
heavily O
reliant O
upon O
manual O
curation O
and O
biochemical O
insight. O
The O
effectiveness O
of O
a O
