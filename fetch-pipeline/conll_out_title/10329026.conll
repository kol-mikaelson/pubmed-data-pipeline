# Abstract
The O
normal O
growth O
and O
differentiation O
of O
the O
epidermis O
require O
an O
adequate O
supply O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
A. I-Chemical
The O
active O
form O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
A I-Chemical
for O
normal O
epidermal O
homeostasis O
is O
retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(RA). B-Chemical
Retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
controls O
the O
expression O
of O
retinoid-responsive O
genes O
via O
interactions O
of O
the O
retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
nuclear O
receptor O
complexes O
at O
specific O
DNA O
sequences O
in O
their O
control O
regions. O
The O
message O
conveyed O
by O
RA B-Chemical
is O
likely O
modulated O
by O
the O
concentration O
of O
the O
ligand O
available O
for O
binding O
to O
the O
receptors. O
Following O
the O
uptake O
of O
plasma O
retinol, B-Chemical
epidermal O
keratinocytes O
synthesize O
retinoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
via O
two O
sequential O
reactions O
with O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical
as O
an O
intermediate. O
Several O
retinol B-Chemical
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(RDH) B-Gene
enzymes, O
members O
of O
the O
short-chain O
dehydrogenase O
reductase O
(SDR) O
gene O
superfamily, O
catalyze O
the O
first O
and O
rate-limiting O
step O
that O
generates O
retinaldehyde B-Chemical
from O
retinol B-Chemical
bound O
to O
cellular O
retinol-binding O
protein O
(holo-CRBP). O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
these O
enzymes O
and O
their O
genes O
in O
the O
epidermal O
cells. O
Our O
work O
describes O
the O
first O
member O
of O
the O
RDH B-Gene
family O
found O
in O
epidermis. O
We O
show O
that O
this O
gene O
is O
expressed O
predominantly O
in O
the O
differentiating O
spinous O
layers O
and O
that O
it O
is O
under O
positive, O
feed-forward O
regulation O
by O
retinoic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
It O
encodes O
a O
protein O
that, O
using O
NAD+ B-Chemical
as O
a O
preferred O
cofactor, O
utilizes O
free O
and O
CRBP-bound O
all-trans-retinol B-Chemical
and O
steroids B-Chemical
as O
substrates. O
