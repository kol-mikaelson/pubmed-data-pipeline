# Abstract
Quinolinate B-Gene
phosphoribosyl I-Gene
transferase I-Gene
(QPRT) B-Gene
is O
a O
key O
enzyme O
in O
de O
novo O
NAD(+) B-Chemical
synthesis. O
QPRT B-Gene
enzyme O
activity O
has O
a O
restricted O
tissue O
distribution, O
although O
QPRT B-Gene
mRNA O
is O
expressed O
ubiquitously. O
This O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
elucidate O
the O
functions O
of O
QPRT B-Gene
protein O
in O
addition O
to O
NAD(+) B-Chemical
synthesis. O
QPRT B-Gene
was O
identified O
as O
a O
caspase-3 B-Gene
binding O
protein O
using O
double O
layer O
fluorescent O
zymography, O
but O
was O
not O
a O
substrate O
for O
caspase-3. B-Gene
Surface O
plasmon O
resonance O
analysis O
using O
recombinant O
proteins O
showed O
interaction O
of O
QPRT B-Gene
with O
active-caspase-3 O
in O
a O
dose O
dependent O
manner O
at O
55 O
nM O
of O
the O
dissociation O
constant. O
The O
interaction O
was O
also O
confirmed O
by O
immunoprecipitation O
analysis O
of O
actinomycin O
D-treated O
QPRT-FLAG O
expressing O
cells O
using O
anti-FLAG-agarose. O
QPRT-depleted O
cells O
showed O
increased O
sensitivity O
to O
spontaneous O
cell O
death, O
upregulated O
caspase-3 B-Gene
activity O
and O
strong O
active-caspase-3 O
signals. O
Considered O
together, O
the O
results O
suggested O
that O
QPRT B-Gene
protein O
acts O
as O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
spontaneous O
cell O
death O
by O
suppressing O
overproduction O
of O
active-caspase-3. O
