# Abstract
The O
ability O
of O
intestinal O
mucosa O
to O
absorb O
dietary O
ferric B-Chemical
iron B-Chemical
is O
attributed O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
brush-border O
membrane O
reductase O
activity O
that O
displays O
adaptive O
responses O
to O
iron B-Chemical
status. O
We O
have O
isolated O
a O
complementary O
DNA, O
Dcytb B-Gene
(for O
duodenal B-Gene
cytochrome I-Gene
b), I-Gene
which O
encoded O
a O
putative O
plasma O
membrane O
di-heme O
protein O
in O
mouse B-Species
duodenal O
mucosa. O
Dcytb B-Gene
shared O
between O
45 O
and O
50% O
similarity O
to O
the O
cytochrome B-Gene
b561 I-Gene
family O
of O
plasma O
membrane O
reductases, O
was O
highly O
expressed O
in O
the O
brush-border O
membrane O
of O
duodenal O
enterocytes, O
and O
induced O
ferric O
reductase O
activity O
when O
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
oocytes O
and O
cultured O
cells. O
Duodenal O
expression O
levels O
of O
Dcytb B-Gene
messenger O
RNA O
and O
protein O
were O
regulated O
by O
changes O
in O
physiological O
modulators O
of O
iron B-Chemical
absorption. O
Thus, O
Dcytb B-Gene
provides O
an O
important O
element O
in O
the O
iron B-Chemical
absorption O
pathway. O
