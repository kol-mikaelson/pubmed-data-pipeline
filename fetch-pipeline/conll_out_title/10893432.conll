# Abstract
The O
Na(+) B-Gene
I(-) B-Chemical
symporter I-Gene
(NIS) B-Gene
is O
an O
intrinsic O
membrane O
protein O
that O
mediates O
the O
active O
transport O
of O
iodide B-Chemical
into O
the O
thyroid B-Disease
and O
other O
tissues, O
such O
as O
salivary O
glands, O
gastric O
mucosa, O
and O
lactating O
mammary O
gland. O
NIS B-Gene
plays O
key O
roles O
in O
thyroid B-Disease
pathophysiology O
as O
the O
route O
by O
which O
iodide B-Chemical
reaches O
the O
gland O
for O
thyroid B-Disease
hormone O
biosynthesis O
and O
as O
a O
means O
for O
diagnostic O
scintigraphic O
imaging O
and O
for O
radioiodide B-Chemical
therapy O
in O
hyperthyroidism B-Disease
and O
thyroid B-Disease
cancer. B-Disease
The O
molecular O
characterization O
of O
NIS B-Gene
started O
with O
the O
1996 O
isolation O
of O
a O
cDNA O
encoding O
rat B-Species
NIS B-Gene
and O
has O
since O
continued O
at O
a O
rapid O
pace. O
Anti-NIS O
antibodies O
have O
been O
prepared O
and O
used O
to O
study O
NIS B-Gene
topology O
and O
its O
secondary O
structure. O
The O
biogenesis O
and O
posttranslational O
modifications O
of O
NIS B-Gene
have O
been O
examined, O
a O
thorough O
electrophysiological O
analysis O
of O
NIS B-Gene
has O
been O
conducted, O
the O
cDNA O
encoding O
human B-Species
NIS B-Gene
(hNIS) O
has O
been O
isolated, O
the O
genomic O
organization O
of O
hNIS O
has O
been O
elucidated, O
the O
regulation O
of O
NIS B-Gene
by O
thyrotropin B-Chemical
and O
I(-) B-Chemical
has O
been O
analyzed, O
the O
regulation O
of O
NIS B-Gene
transcription O
has O
been O
studied, O
spontaneous O
NIS B-Gene

have O
been O
identified O
as O

the O
roles O
of O
NIS B-Gene
in O
thyroid B-Disease
cancer B-Disease
and O
thyroid B-Disease
autoimmune I-Disease
disease I-Disease
have O
been O
examined, O
and O
the O
expression O
and O
regulation O
of O
NIS B-Gene
in O
extrathyroidal O
tissues O
have O
been O
investigated. O
In O
gene O
therapy O
experiments, O
the O
rat B-Species
NIS B-Gene
gene O
has O
been O
transduced O
into O
various O
types O
of O
human B-Species
cells, O
which O
then O
exhibited O
active O
iodide B-Chemical
transport O
and O
became O
susceptible O
to O
destruction O
with O
radioiodide. B-Chemical
The O
continued O
molecular O
analysis O
of O
NIS B-Gene
clearly O
holds O
the O
potential O
of O
an O
even O
greater O
impact O
on O
a O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
fields, O
ranging O
from O
structure O
function O
of O
transport O
proteins O
to O
the O
diagnosis O
and O

of O
cancer, B-Disease

the O
thyroid B-Disease
and O
beyond. O
