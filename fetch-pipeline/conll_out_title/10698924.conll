# Abstract
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
(HMGR) O
catalyzes O
the O
formation O
of O
mevalonate, B-Chemical
the O
committed O
step O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
sterols B-Chemical
and O
isoprenoids. B-Chemical
The O
activity O
of O
HMGR O
is O
controlled O
through O
synthesis, O
degradation O
and O
phosphorylation O
to O
maintain O
the O
concentration O
of O
mevalonate-derived O
products. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
physiological O
regulation O
of O
HMGR, O
the O
human B-Species
enzyme O
has O
been O
targeted O
successfully O
by O
drugs O
in O
the O
clinical O
treatment O
of O
high O
