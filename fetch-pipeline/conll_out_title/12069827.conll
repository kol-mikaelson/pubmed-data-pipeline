# Abstract
Compared O
to O
the O
lysophospholipid B-Chemical
mediators, O
sphingosine-1-phosphate B-Chemical
(S1P) B-Chemical
and O
lysophosphatidic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(LPA), B-Chemical
little O
information O
is O
available O
regarding O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
of O
action, O
metabolism O
and O
physiological O
significance O
of O
the O
related O
sphingosylphosphorylcholine B-Chemical
(SPC). B-Chemical
S1P B-Chemical
and O
LPA B-Chemical
have O
recently O
been O
established O
as O
agonists O
at O
several O
G-protein-coupled O
receptors O
of O
the O
EDG O
family, O
S1P B-Chemical
additionally O
serves O
an O
intracellular O
second O
messenger O
function. O
Several O
cellular O
effects O
of O
SPC B-Chemical
can O
be O
explained O
by O
low-affinity O
binding O
to O
and O
activation O
of O
S1P-EDG O
receptors. O
However, O
certain O
cellular O
and O
subcellular O
actions O
of O
SPC B-Chemical
are O
not O
shared O
by O
S1P, B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
SPC, B-Chemical
which O
has O
been O
identified O
in O
normal O
blood O
plasma, O
ascites B-Disease
and O
various O
tissues, O
is O
a O
lipid B-Chemical
mediator O
in O
its O
own O
right. O
This O
concept O
was O
corroborated O
by O
the O
recent O
discovery O
of O
specific O
high-affinity O
G-protein-coupled O
SPC B-Chemical
receptors. O
In O
this O
article, O
our O
present O
knowledge O
on O
cellular O
actions O
and O
biological O
functions O
of O
SPC B-Chemical
will O
be O
reviewed. O
