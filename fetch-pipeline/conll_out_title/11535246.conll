# Abstract
Cytosolic O
sulphotransferases O
transfer O
the O
sulpho B-Chemical
moiety O
from O
the O
cofactor O
5'-phosphoadenosine-3'-phosphosulphate B-Chemical
(PAPS) B-Chemical
to O
nucleophilic O
groups O
of O
xenobiotics O
and O
small O
endogenous O
compounds O
(such O
as O
hormones O
and O
neurotransmitters). O
This O
reaction O
often O
leads O
to O
products O
that O
can O
be O
excreted O
readily. O
However, O
other O
sulpho B-Chemical
conjugates O
are O
strong O
electrophiles O
and O
may O
covalently O
bind O
with O
DNA O
and O
proteins. O
All O
known O
cytosolic O
sulphotransferases O
are O
members O
of O
an O
enzyme O
gene O
superfamily O
termed O
SULT. O
In O
humans, O
10 O
SULT O
genes O
are O
known. O
One O
of O
these O
genes O
encodes O
two O
different O
enzyme O
forms O
due O
to O
the O
use O
of O
alternative O
first O
exons. O
Different O
SULT O
forms O
substantially O
differ O
in O
their O
substrate O
specificity O
and O
tissue O
distribution. O
Genetic O
polymorphisms O
have O
been O
described O
for O
three O
human B-Species
SULTs. O
Several O
allelic O
variants O
differ O
in O
functional O
properties, O
including O
the O
activation O
of O
promutagens. O
Only O
initial O
results O
are O
available O
from O
the O
analysis O
of O
SULT O
allele O
frequencies O
in O
different O
population O
groups, O
e.g. O
subjects O
suffering O
from O
specific O
diseases O
and O
corresponding O
controls. O
