# Abstract
Retinoids B-Chemical
play O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
vision, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
development O
and O
cellular O
differentiation. O
beta,beta-Carotene-15,15'-dioxygenase B-Gene
(Bcdo), B-Gene
the O
enzyme O
that O
catalyzes O
the O
oxidative O
cleavage O
of O
beta,beta-carotene B-Chemical
into O
two O
retinal B-Chemical
molecules, O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
retinoid B-Chemical
synthesis. O
We O
report O
here O
the O
first O
cloning O
of O
a O
mammalian O
Bcdo. B-Gene
Human B-Species
BCDO B-Gene
encodes O
a O
protein O

547 O
amino O

(RPE) B-CellLine
and O
also O
in O
kidney, O
intestine, O
liver, O

The O
gene O

approximately O
20 O
kb, O
is O

16q21-q23. O
A O

and O
its O

is O
83% O

BCDO B-Gene
demonstrates O
the O

beta,beta-carotene-15,15'-dioxygenase B-Gene
activity. O
The O
expression O

of O
BCDO B-Gene
suggests O
that O
it O
may O
provide O
a O
local O
supplement O
to O
the O

that O
many O
of O
the O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
retinoid B-Chemical

that O
BCDO B-Gene
