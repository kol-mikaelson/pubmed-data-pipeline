# Abstract
Monocarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
may O
be O
oxidized O
at O
the O
omega- O
and O
(omega-1)- B-Chemical
positions O
to O
form O
dicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(DCAs) B-Chemical
and O
(omega-1)-hydroxy- B-Chemical
or I-Chemical
(omega-1)-oxoacids. B-Chemical
The O
significance O
of O
this O
pathway O
under O
normal O
conditions O
is O
unknown, O
but O
DCAs B-Chemical
and O
(omega-1)-hydroxyacids B-Chemical
are O
prominent O
features O
of O
disease O
states. O
The O
stimulation O
of O
this O
pathway O
has O
been O
linked O
to O
induction O
of O
fatty B-Gene
acid-binding I-Gene
protein I-Gene
and O
peroxisomal O
proliferation. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
examined O
the O
effect O
of O
acetylsalicylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(ASA) B-Chemical
on O
(omega-1)-oxidation. O
(Omega-1)-oxidation O
was O
assessed O
in O
subcellular O
fractions O
of O
rat B-Species
liver. O
Rats B-Species
were O
fed O
a O
normal O
diet O
or O
an O
ASA-supplemented O
diet. O
Products O
were O
identified O
by O
gas O
chromatography-mass O
spectrometry O
(GC-MS) O
and O
by O
comparison O
with O
the O
properties O
of O
authentic O
synthetic O
standards. O
Doses O
of O
ASA B-Chemical
that O
produced O
relatively O
low O
serum O
concentrations O
(12-24 O
mg O
dl) O
resulted O
in O
as O
much O
as O
a O
20-fold O
increase O
in O
the O
capacity O
for O
(omega-1)-oxidation O
of O
medium O
(C12-C15) B-Chemical
and O
long B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
(C16-C20) I-Chemical
monocarboxylic B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
Normal O
rat B-Species
liver O
oxidizes O
monocarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
to O
(omega-1)-oxoacids, B-Chemical
while O
liver O
from O
ASA-treated O
rats B-Species
converts O
these O
substrates O
to O
(omega-1)-oxodicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
(omega-1)-oxoacids. B-Chemical
The O
formation O
of O
oxoacids B-Chemical
and O
oxodicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
may O
be O
due O
to O
different O
enzymes. O
The O
formation O
of O
oxodicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
appears O
to O
be O
more O
labile O
than O
the O
formation O
of O
oxoacids. B-Chemical
These O
two O
processes O
also O
are O
differentially O
induced O
by O
ASA B-Chemical
and O
have O
different O
substrate O
specificities. O
These O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
ASA B-Chemical
is O
a O
potent O
stimulant O
of O
(omega-1)-oxidation O
and O
induces O
the O
formation O
of O
products O
that O
can O
be O
shortened O
in O
peroxisomes O
to O
key O
metabolic O
intermediates. O
