# Abstract
1. O
ATB(0,+) B-Gene
is O
an O
amino O
acid O
transporter O
energized O
by O
transmembrane O
gradients O
of O
Na+ O
and O
Cl(-) O
and O
membrane O
potential. O
We O
cloned O
this O
transporter O
from O
mouse B-Species
colon O
and O
expressed O
the O
clone O
functionally O
in O
mammalian B-Species

and O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
to O
investigate O
the O
interaction O
of O
carnitine B-Chemical
and O
its O
acyl B-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
with O
the O
transporter. O
2. O
When O
expressed O
in O
mammalian B-Species
cells, O
the O
cloned O
ATB(0,+) B-Gene
was O
able O
to O
transport O
carnitine, B-Chemical
propionylcarnitine B-Chemical
and O
acetylcarnitine. B-Chemical
The O
transport O
process O
was O
Na(+) O
and O
Cl(-) O
dependent O
and O
inhibitable O
by O
the O
amino O
acid O
substrates O
of O
the O
transporter. O
The O
Michaelis O
constant O
for O
carnitine B-Chemical
was O
0.83 O
+ O
- O
0.08 O
mM O
and O
the O

3. O
When O
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes, O
the O
cloned O
ATB(0,+) B-Gene
was O
able O
to O
induce O
inward O
currents O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
carnitine B-Chemical
and O
propionylcarnitine B-Chemical
under O
voltage-clamped O
conditions. O
There O
was O
no O
detectable O
current O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
acetylcarnitine. B-Chemical
Carnitine-induced O
currents O
were O
obligatorily O
dependent O
on O
the O
presence O
of O
Na(+) O
and O
Cl(-). O
The O
currents O
were O
saturable O
with O
carnitine B-Chemical
and O
the O
Michaelis O
constant O
was O
1.8 O

- O
0.4 O
mM. O
The O
analysis O
of O
Na(+)- O
and O
Cl(-)-activation O
kinetics O
revealed O
that O
2 O
Na(+) O
and O
1 O
Cl(-) O
were O
involved O
in O
the O
transport O
of O
carnitine B-Chemical
via O
the O
transporter. O

These O
studies O
describe O
the O
identification O
of O
a O
novel O
function O
for O
the O
amino O
acid O
transporter O
ATB(0,+). B-Gene
Since O
this O
transporter O
is O
expressed O
in O
the O
intestinal O
tract, O
lung O
and O
mammary O
gland, O
it O
is O
likely O
to O
play O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
the O
handling O
of O
carnitine B-Chemical
in O
these O
tissues. O
5. O
A O
Na(+)-dependent O
transport O
system O
for O
carnitine B-Chemical
has O
already O
been O
described. O
This O
transporter, O
known O
as O
OCTN2 B-Gene
(novel O
organic O
cation O
transporter O
2), O
is O
expressed O
in O
most O
tissues O
and O
transports O
carnitine B-Chemical
with O
high O
affinity. O
It O
is O
energized, O
however, O
only O
by O
a O
Na(+) O
gradient O
and O
membrane O
potential. O
In O
contrast, O
ATB(0,+) B-Gene
is O
a O
low-affinity O
transporter O
for O
carnitine, B-Chemical
but O
exhibits O
much O
higher O
concentrative O
capacity O
than O
OCTN2 B-Gene
because O
of O
its O
energization O
by O
transmembrane O
gradients O
of O
Na(+) O
and O
Cl(-) O
as O
well O
as O
by O
membrane O
potential. O
