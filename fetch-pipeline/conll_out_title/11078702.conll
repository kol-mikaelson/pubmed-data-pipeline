the O

In O
this O
study, O
the O
time O

and O
mechanisms O
of O
guanine B-Chemical
nucleotide I-Chemical
transport O
are O
characterized. O
Two O
distinct O
mechanisms O
of O
transport O
were O
found O
to O
be O
capable O
of O
moving O
guanine B-Chemical
nucleotides I-Chemical
across O
the O
inner O
membrane. O
The O
first O
carrier O
was O
saturable, O
displayed O
temperature O

preferred O

GTP, B-Chemical
and O
did O
not O
transport O

or O

When O

However, O
transport O

on O
this O

suggesting O
that O
this O
carrier O

not O

Because O
transport O
on O
this O
carrier O
was O
also O
inhibited O
by O
atractyloside, B-Chemical
this O
carrier O
was O
consistent O

The O
second O
mechanism O
of O
guanine B-Chemical

uptake O
was O
insensitive O
to O
atractyloside, B-Chemical
displayed O
temperature O

and O
was O
capable O
of O
transporting O
GMP, B-Chemical
GDP, B-Chemical
and O

at O

However, O
because O

guanine B-Chemical

transport O
is O

in O
nondividing O

such O

this O
transport O
process O
is O
nevertheless O
sufficient O
to O
account O
for O
the O

of O
guanine B-Chemical

and O
may O

the O
