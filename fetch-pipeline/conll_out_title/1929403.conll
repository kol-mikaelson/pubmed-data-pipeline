# Abstract
Previous O
studies O
from O
our O
laboratories O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
metabolism O
of O
the O
cholesterol-lowering O
drug O
lovastatin B-Chemical
by O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
occurs O
primarily O
at O
the O
6'-position, O
giving O
6' B-Chemical
beta-hydroxy- I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
6'-exomethylene-lovastatin I-Chemical
and O
that O
these O
oxidations O
are O
catalyzed O
by O
cytochrome O
P450-dependent O
monooxygenases. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
the O
specific O
cytochrome O
P450 O
form O
involved O
in O
lovastatin B-Chemical
oxidation O
was O
identified O
through O

With O

both O

In O

These O
results O
clearly O
indicate O
that O
cytochrome B-Gene

are O
primarily O
responsible O

the O
