# Abstract
The O
biosynthesis O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
is O
mainly O
regulated O
by O
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl B-Gene
coenzyme I-Gene
A I-Gene
(HMG-CoA) B-Gene
reductase. I-Gene
Because O
the O
liver O
is O
the O
major O
site O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
synthesis, O
it O
is O
the O
primary O
target O
of O
the O
class O
of O
drugs O
known O
as O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors. O
Simvastatin B-Chemical
(SV) B-Chemical
is O
a O
lactone B-Chemical
prodrug O
which O
undergoes O
reversible O
metabolism. O
In O
the O
hydroxy B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
form O
(SVA) O
it O
is O
a O
potent O
inhibitor O
of O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase. I-Gene
SV B-Chemical
is O
well O
absorbed O
by O
rats, B-Species
dogs, B-Species
and O
humans. B-Species
After O
an O
oral O
dose O
of O
SV, B-Chemical
tissue O
distribution O
studies O
were O
consistent O
with O
high O
hepatic O
extraction O
of O
SV B-Chemical
and O
relatively O
poor O
tissue O
penetration O
of O
SVA. O
The O
majority O
of O
a O
radioactive O
dose O
of O
SV B-Chemical
is O
eliminated O
in O
bile. O
A O
high O
portal O
systemic O
gradient O
for O
6'-OH-SVA, B-Chemical
an O
active O
biliary O
metabolite, O
suggests O
its O
probable O
reentry O
and O
indicates O
potential O
for O
prolongation O
of O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibition. O
AUC O
comparisons O
in O
dogs B-Species
after O
simultaneous O
iv O
(3H) B-Chemical
and O
intraportal O
(14C) B-Chemical
infusions O
indicate O
that O
hepatic O
extraction O
is O
high O
with O
only O
8% O
of O
SV B-Chemical
reaching O
the O
systemic O
circulation O
unchanged. O
Approximately O
98% O
and O
96% O
of O
SV B-Chemical
was O
bound O
to O
human B-Species
and O
dog B-Species
plasma O
protein, O
respectively. O
The O
physiological O
disposition O
of O
SV B-Chemical
in O
dog B-Species
appears O
to O
be O
a O
suitable O
paradigm O
for O
man. B-Species
Because O
of O
its O
high O
hepatic O
extraction O
SV B-Chemical
should O
be O
both O
specific O
and O
selective O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
inhibition O
of O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase. I-Gene
