# Abstract
Canavan B-Disease
disease I-Disease
is O
a O
genetic B-Disease
disorder I-Disease
associated O
with O
optic B-Disease
neuropathy I-Disease
and O
the O
metabolism O
of O
N-acetylaspartate B-Chemical
is O
defective O
in O
this O
disorder O
due O
to O
mutations O
in O
the O
gene O
coding O
for O
the O
enzyme O
aspartoacylase O
II. O
Here O
we O
show O
that O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
transporter O
NaDC3, B-Gene
a O
Na+-coupled O
transporter O
for O
dicarboxylates, B-Chemical
is O
able O
to O
transport O
N-acetylaspartate, B-Chemical
suggesting O
that O
the O
transporter O
may O
function O
in O
concert O
with O
aspartoacylase O
II O
in O
the O
metabolism O
of O
N-acetylaspartate. B-Chemical
Since O
Canavan B-Disease
disease I-Disease
is O
associated O
with O
ocular O
complications, O
we O
investigated O
the O
expression O
pattern O
of O
NaDC3 B-Gene
and O
aspartoacylase O
II O
in O
ocular O
tissues O
in O
mouse B-Species
by O
in O
situ O
hybridization. O
These O
studies O
show O
that O
NaDC3 B-Gene
mRNA O
is O
expressed O
in O
the O
optic O
nerve, O
most O
layers O
of O
the O
retina, O
retinal O
pigment O
epithelium, O
ciliary O
body, O
iris, O
and O
lens. O
Aspartoacylase O
II O
mRNA O
is O
coexpressed O
in O
most O
of O
these O
cell O
types. O
We O
conclude O
that O
transport O
of O
N-acetylaspartate B-Chemical
into O
ocular O
tissues O
via O
NaDC3 B-Gene
and O
its O
subsequent O
hydrolysis O
by O
aspartoacylase O
II O
play O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
the O
maintenance O
of O
visual O
function. O
