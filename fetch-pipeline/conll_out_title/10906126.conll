# Abstract
cDNAs O
encoding O
a O
novel O
phosphodiesterase, O
phosphodiesterase O
11A O
(PDE11A), O
were O
isolated O
by O
a O
combination O
of O
reverse O
transcriptase-polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
using O
degenerate O
oligonucleotide O
primers O
and O
rapid O
amplification O
of O
cDNA O
ends. O
Their O
catalytic O
domain O
was O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
PDE11A1 O
(490 O
amino O
acids) O
reported O
during O
the O
course O
of O
this O
study. O
However, O
the O
cDNAs O
we O
isolated O
had O
N O
termini O
distinct O
from O
PDE11A1, O
indicating O
two O
novel O
N-terminal O
variants O
of O
PDE11A. O
PDE11A3 O
cDNA O
encoded O
a O
684-amino O
acid O
protein O
including O
one O
complete O
and O
one O
incomplete O
GAF O
domain O
in O
the O
N-terminal O
region. O
PDE11A4 O
was O
composed O
of O
934 O
amino O
acids O
including O
two O
complete O
GAF O
domains O
and O
shared O
630 O
C-terminal O
amino O
acids O
with O
PDE11A3 O
but O
had O
a O
distinct O
N O
terminus O
containing O
the O
putative O
phosphorylation O
sites O
for O
cAMP- B-Chemical
and O
cGMP-dependent O
protein O
kinases. O
PDE11A3 O
transcripts O
were O
specifically O
expressed O
in O
testis, O
whereas O
PDE11A4 O
transcripts O
were O
particularly O
abundant O
in O
prostate. O
Recombinant O
PDE11A4 O
expressed O
in O
COS-7 B-CellLine
cells O
hydrolyzed O
cAMP B-Chemical
and O
cGMP O
with O
K(m) O
values O
of O
3.0 O
and O
1.4 O
microm, O
respectively, O
and O
the O
V(max) O
value O
with O
cAMP B-Chemical
was O
almost O
twice O
that O
with O
cGMP. O
Although O
PDE11A3 O
showed O
the O
same O
K(m) O
values O
as O
PDE11A4, O
the O
relative O
V(max) O
values O
of O
PDE11A3 O
were O
approximately O
one-sixth O
of O
those O
of O
PDE11A4. O
PDE11A4, O
but O
not O
PDE11A3, O
was O
phosphorylated O
by O
both O
cAMP- B-Chemical
and O
cGMP-dependent O
protein O
kinases O
in O
vitro. O
Thus, O
the O
PDE11A O
gene O
undergoes O
tissue-specific O
alternative O
splicing O
that O
generates O
structurally O
and O
functionally O
distinct O
gene O
products. O
