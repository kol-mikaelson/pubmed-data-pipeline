# Abstract
Naturally O
occurring O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
compounds O
comprise O
a O
plant O
form, O
phylloquinone B-Chemical
(vitamin B-Chemical
K(1)) I-Chemical
and O
a O
series O
of O
bacterial O
menaquinones B-Chemical
(MKs) O
(vitamin B-Chemical
K(2)). I-Chemical
Structural O
differences O
in O
the O
isoprenoid B-Chemical
side O
chain O
govern O
many O
facets O
of O
metabolism O
of O
K B-Chemical
vitamins I-Chemical
including O
the O
way O
they O
are O
transported, O
taken O
up O
by O
target O
tissues, O
and O
subsequently O
excreted. O
In O
the O
post-prandial O
state, O
phylloquinone B-Chemical
is O
transported O
mainly O
by O
triglyceride-rich O
lipoproteins O
(TRL) O
and O
long-chain O
MKs O
mainly O
by O
low-density O
lipoproteins O
(LDL). O
TRL-borne O
phylloquinone B-Chemical
uptake O
by O
osteoblasts O
is O
an O
apoE-mediated O
process O
with O
the O
LRP1 O
receptor O
playing O
a O
predominant O
role. O
One O
K(2) O
form, O
MK-4, B-Chemical
has O
a O
highly O
specific O
tissue O
distribution O
suggestive O
of O
local O
synthesis O
from O
phylloquinone B-Chemical
in O
which O
menadione B-Chemical
is O
an O
intermediate. O
Both O
phylloquinone B-Chemical
and O
MKs O
activate O
the O
steroid B-Gene
and I-Gene
xenobiotic I-Gene
receptor I-Gene
(SXR) B-Gene
that O
initiates O
their O
catabolism, O
but O
MK-4 B-Chemical
specifically O
upregulates O
two O
genes O
suggesting O
a O
novel O
MK-4 B-Chemical
signalling O
pathway. O
Many O
studies O
have O
shown O
specific O
clinical O
benefits O
of O
MK-4 B-Chemical
at O
pharmacological O
doses O
for O
osteoporosis B-Disease
and O
cancer B-Disease
although O
the O
mechanism(s) O
are O
poorly O
understood. O
Other O
putative O
non-cofactor O
functions O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
include O
the O
suppression O
of O
inflammation, B-Disease
prevention O
of O
brain B-Disease
oxidative I-Disease
damage I-Disease
and O
a O
role O
in O
sphingolipid B-Chemical
synthesis. O
Anticoagulant O
drugs O
block O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
recycling O
and O
thereby O
the O
availability O
of O
reduced O
vitamin B-Chemical
K. I-Chemical
Under O
extreme O
blockade, O
vitamin B-Chemical
K I-Chemical
can O
bypass O
the O
inhibition O
of O
Gla B-Gene
synthesis O
in O
the O
liver O
but O
not O
in O
the O
bone O
and O
the O
vessel O
wall. O
In O
humans, B-Species
MK-7 B-Chemical
has O
a O
greater O
efficacy O
than O
phylloquinone B-Chemical
in O
carboxylating O
both O
liver O
and O
bone O
Gla B-Gene
proteins. O
A O
daily O
supplement O
of O
phylloquinone B-Chemical
has O
shown O
potential O
for O
improving O
anticoagulation O
control. O
