# Abstract
Sterol B-Gene
C5 I-Gene
desaturase I-Gene
(SC5D) B-Gene
converts O
lathosterol B-Chemical
to O
7-dehydrocholesterol B-Chemical
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
investigated O
the O
genome O
structure O
of O
SC5D B-Gene
and O
transcription O
of O
the O
human B-Species
SC5D B-Gene
gene O
to O
try O
to O
elucidate O
the O
mechanism O
by O
which O
cholesterol B-Chemical
synthesis O
is O
regulated. O
The O
SC5D B-Gene
gene O
had O
a O
structural O
gene O
from O
a O
single O
copy O
from O
genome O
DNA O
that O
contained O
five O
exons O
and O
four O
introns. O
The O
human B-Species
SC5D B-Gene
was O
found O
to O
be O
located O
in O
chromosome O
11q24.2-24.3 O

Human B-Species
SC5D B-Gene
mRNA O
transcripts, O
of O
which O
the O
major O
transcript O
was O
a O
2 O
kb O
and O
the O
minor O
transcripts O
were O
8 O
kb O
and O
1.4 O
kb O
mRNA O
transcripts, O
were O
detected O
in O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
tissues O
examined. O
The O
human B-Species
SC5D B-Gene
gene O
contained O
a O
GC O
box O
instead O
of O
a O
TATA O
box O
upstream O
of O
the O
transcript O
start O
sites. O
Human B-Species
SC5D B-Gene
transcription O
started O
from O
several O
transcription O
start O
sites, O
and O
the O
first O
start O
site O
was O
located O
31 O
bp O
upstream O
of O
the O
translation O
start O
site O
(ATG). O
The O
