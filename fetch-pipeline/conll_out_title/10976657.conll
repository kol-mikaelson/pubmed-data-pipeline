# Abstract
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
sodium, I-Chemical
a O
novel O
statin, O
is O
a O
synthetic, O
enantiomerically O
pure, O
pyridine B-Chemical
derivative O
that O
effectively O
reduces O
serum O
cholesterol B-Chemical
levels O
at O
microgram O
doses. O
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
readily O
and O
completely O
absorbed O
from O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract, O
with O
plasma O
concentrations O
reaching O
a O
peak O
2 O
to O
3 O
hours O
postadministration O
followed O
by O
a O
monoexponential O

an O

of O
2 O

3 O
hours. O
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics O
are O
linear: O
maximum O
plasma O
concentration O
(Cmax) O
and O
area O
under O
the O
concentration-time O
curve O
(AUC) O
are O
proportional O
to O
the O
dose O
over O
the O
range O
of O
0.05 O
to O
0.8 O
mg. O
No O
accumulation O
is O
observed O
on O
repeated O
administration. O
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
interindividual O
variability O
is O
described O
by O

of O
variation O
of O
approximately O
30 O
to O
40% O
for O
its O
primary O
pharmacokinetic O

and O
t1 O
2beta. O
The O
mean O
absolute O
oral O
bioavailability O
of O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
60% O
because O
of O
presystemic O
first-pass O
effects. O
Its O
pharmacokinetics O
are O
not O
influenced O
by O
concomitant O
administration O
of O
food O
nor O
by O
the O
time O
of O
day O
at O
which O
the O
dose O
is O
given. O
Age, O
gender, O
ethnicity O
and O
concurrent O
disease O
also O
have O
no O
clinically O
significant O
effects. O
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
highly O
bound O
to O
plasma O
proteins O
(>99%). O
The O
volume O
of O
distribution O
at O
steady O
state O
of O
about O
0.3 O
L O
kg O
indicates O
that O
the O
drug O
penetrates O
only O
moderately O
into O
tissue; O
conversely, O
preclinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
a O
high O
affinity O
for O
liver O
tissue, O
the O
target O
site O
of O
action. O
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
exclusively O
cleared O
via O
metabolism. O
No O
unchanged O
drug O
is O
excreted. O
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
subject O
to O
2 O
main O

of O

benzylic O
methyl O

leading O
to O
the O
metabolite O
M-1 B-Chemical
[catalysed O

the O
6-isopropyl O

M-23 B-Chemical
(catalysed O

CYP2C8). B-Gene
The O
product O
of O
the O
combined O
biotransformation O

is O
a O
secondary O
minor O
metabolite, O
M-24, B-Chemical
not O
detectable O
in O
plasma. O
All O
3 O
metabolites O
are O
active O
inhibitors O
of O
hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme O
A O
reductase O
with O
a O
similar O
potency O
to O
the O
parent O
drug. O
Approximately O
70% O
of O
the O
administered O
dose O
is O
excreted O
as O
metabolites O
in O
the O
faeces, O
and O
30% O
in O
the O
urine. O
Metabolism O
by O
2 O
distinct O
CYP O
isoforms O
renders O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
relatively O
resistant O
to O
interactions O
arising O
from O
inhibition O
of O
CYP. O
If O
one O
of O
the O
pathways O
is O
blocked, O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
can O
be O
effectively O
metabolised O
by O
the O
alternative O
route. O
In O
addition, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
in O

investigations, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
for O
either O
cerivastatin B-Chemical
or O
its O
metabolites O
having O
any O
inducing O
or O
inhibitory O
activity O
on O
CYP. O
The O
apparent O

of O
any O
clinically O
relevant O
interactions O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
drugs O
commonly O
used O
