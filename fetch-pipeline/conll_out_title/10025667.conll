# Abstract
Parental O
Chinese B-CellLine
hamster I-CellLine
ovary I-CellLine
(CHO) B-CellLine
cells O
were O
mutagenized O
and O
subjected O
first O
to O
a O
mannose B-Chemical
suicide O
selection O
technique O
and O
second O
to O
a O
screen O
of O
individual O
colonies O
grown O
on O
polyester B-Chemical
discs O
for O
reduced O
mannose B-Chemical
incorporation O
into O
protein. O
The O
incorporation O
of O
radioactivity O
for O
the O
selection O
and O
the O
screen O
was O
conducted O
at O
41.5 O
degrees O

the O
isolation O

lesions. O
This O
selection O
screening O
procedure O
resulted O
in O
the O
isolation O
of O
M15-4 B-CellLine
cells, O
which O
had O
three- O

The O
defect O
of O
M15-4 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
determined O
to O
be O
in O
hexokinase O
activity; O
crude O
cytosolic O
extracts O
were O
eight- O
to O
nine-fold O
lower O
in O
hexokinase O
activity O
in O
M15-4 B-CellLine
cells O
compared O
to O
parental O
cells. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
defect, O
incorporation O
of O
labeled O
mannose B-Chemical
from O
the O
medium O
was O
significantly O
decreased. O
However, O
the O
level O
of O
GDP-mannose B-Chemical
in O
M15-4 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
70% O
of O
normal. O
The O
phenotype O
of O
M15-4 B-CellLine
was O
a O
lower O
specific O
activity O
of O
labeled O
GDP-mannose, B-Chemical
not O
a O
substantial O
reduction O
in O
the O
level O
of O

Consistent O
with O
these O
results, O
no O
alterations O
in O
the O
glycosylation O
of O

observed. O
These O
cells O
