# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Although O
octanoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(C8) B-Chemical
concentrations O
measured O
from O
newborn O
screening O
dried O
blood O
spots O
are O
used O
to O
identify O
those O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
medium-chain B-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
(MCADD), B-Disease
age-related O
reference O
values O
are O
currently O
not O
available O
for O
unaffected O
newborn O
populations. O
Because O
age O
at O
sampling O
may O
vary O
within O
and O
between O
screening O
programs, O
variations O
in O
C8 B-Chemical
concentrations O
by O
age O
may O
affect O
screening O
program O
performance. O
We O
determined O
whether O
C8 B-Chemical
concentrations O
vary O
by O
age O
at O
sampling, O
sex, O
birth O
weight, O
or O
gestational O
age O
in O
unaffected O
newborns. O
METHODS: O
We O
analyzed O
C8 B-Chemical
concentrations O
from O
227,098 O
unaffected O
newborns, O
including O
179,729 O
from O
6 O
English O
laboratories O
participating O
in O
a O
multicenter O
study O
and O
47,369 O
from O
the O
single O
laboratory O
serving O
the O
New O
South O
Wales O
(NSW) O
Newborn O
Screening O
Program O
in O
Australia. O
In O
England, O
the O
majority O
of O
samples O
were O
collected O
at O
age O
5-8 O
days O
and O
analyzed O
underivatized O
by O
use O
of O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
(MS O
MS); O
in O
NSW, O
samples O
were O
obtained O
at O
a O
median O
age O
of O
3 O
days O
and O
analyzed O
derivatized O
by O
MS O
MS. O
Information O
on O
infants' O
sex, O
birth O
weight, O
gestation, O
hospitalization, O
and O
transfusion O
status O
was O
recorded O
at O
time O
of O
sampling. O
RESULTS: O
C8 B-Chemical
concentrations O
did O
not O
vary O
significantly O
by O
age O
at O
sampling, O
sex, O
birth O
weight, O
or O
gestational O
age O
and O
remained O
relatively O
constant O
during O
the O
first O
2 O
weeks O
of O
life O
in O
unaffected O
babies O
being O
screened O
for O
MCADD. B-Disease
