# Abstract
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl O
coenzyme O
A O
(HMG-CoA) O
reductase O
inhibitors O
(statins) O
are O
widely O
used O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
hypercholesterolemia. B-Disease
Their O
efficacy O
in O
preventing O
cardiovascular O
events O
has O
been O
shown O
by O
a O
large O
number O
of O
clinical O
trials. O
However, O
myotoxic B-Disease
side O
effects, O
sometimes O
severe, O
including O
myopathy B-Disease
or O
rhabdomyolysis, B-Disease
are O
associated O
with O
the O
use O
of O
statins. O
In O
some O
cases, O
such O
toxicity B-Disease
is O
associated O
with O
pharmacokinetic O
alterations. O
In O
this O
review, O
the O
pharmacokinetic O
aspects O
and O
physicochemical O
properties O
of O
statins O
are O
reviewed O
in O
order O
to O
understand O
the O
mechanism O
governing O
their O
pharmacokinetic O
alterations. O
Among O
the O
statins, O
simvastatin, B-Chemical
lovastatin B-Chemical
and O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
are O
metabolized O
by O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
3A4 I-Gene
(CYP3A4) B-Gene
while O
fluvastatin B-Chemical
is O
metabolized O
by O
CYP2C9. B-Gene
Cerivastatin B-Chemical
is O
subjected O
to O
2 O
metabolic O
pathways O
mediated O
by O
CYP2C8 B-Gene
and I-Gene
3A4. I-Gene
Pravastatin, B-Chemical
rosuvastatin B-Chemical
and O
pitavastatin B-Chemical
undergo O
little O
metabolism. O
Their O
plasma O
clearances O
are O
governed O
by O
the O
transporters O
involved O
in O
the O
hepatic O
uptake O
and O
biliary O
excretion. O
Also O
for O
other O
statins, O
which O
are O
orally O
administered O
as O
open O
acid O
forms O
(i.e. O
fluvastatin, B-Chemical
cerivastatin B-Chemical
and O
atorvastatin), B-Chemical
hepatic O
uptake O
transporter(s) O
play O
important O
roles O
in O
their O
clearances. O
Based O
on O
such O
information, O
pharmacokinetic O
alterations O
of O
statins O
can O
be O
predicted O
following O
coadministration O
of O
other O
drugs O
or O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
lowered O
activities O
in O
drug O
metabolism O
and O
or O
transport. O
We O
also O
present O
a O
quantitative O
analysis O
of O
the O
effect O
of O
some O
factors O
on O
the O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
statins O
based O
on O
a O
physiologically O
based O
pharmacokinetic O
model. O
To O
avoid O
a O
pharmacokinetic O
alteration, O
we O
need O
to O
have O
information O
about O
the O
metabolizing O
enzyme(s) O
and O
transporter(s) O
involved O
in O
the O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
statins O
and, O
along O
with O
such O
information, O
model-based O
prediction O
is O
also O
useful. O
