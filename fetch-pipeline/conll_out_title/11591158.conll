# Abstract
At O
least O
five O
distinct O
carrier O
proteins O
form O
the O
family O
of O
mammalian O
cationic O
amino O
acid O
transporters O
(CATs). O
We O
have O
cloned O
a O
cDNA O
containing O
the O
complete O
coding O
region O
of O
human B-Species
CAT-3. B-Gene
hCAT-3 B-Gene
is O
glycosylated O
and O
localized O
to O
the O
plasma O
membrane. O
Transport O
studies O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes O
revealed O
that O
hCAT-3 B-Gene
is O
selective O
for O
cationic O
L-amino B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
exhibits O
a O
maximal O
transport O
activity O
similar O
to O
other O
CAT B-Gene
proteins. O
The O
apparent O
substrate O
affinity O
and O
sensitivity O
to O
trans-stimulation O
of O
hCAT-3 B-Gene
resembles O
most O
closely O
hCAT-2B. O
This O
is O
in O
contrast O
to O
rat B-Species
and O
murine B-Species
CAT-3 B-Gene
proteins O
that O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
display O
a O
very O
low O
activity O
and O
to O
be O
inhibited O
by O
neutral O
and O
anionic O
L-amino B-Chemical

CAT-3 B-Gene

exclusively O

Human B-Species
CAT-3 B-Gene
expression O
is O
not O
restricted O
to O
the O
brain, O
in O
fact, O
by O
far O
the O
highest O
expression O
was O
found O
in O
thymus. O
Also O
in O
other O
peripheral O
tissues, O
hCAT-3 B-Gene
expression O
was O
equal O
to O
or O
higher O
than O
in O
most O
brain O
regions, O
suggesting O
that O
hCAT-3 B-Gene
is O
not O
a O
neuron-specific O
transporter. O
