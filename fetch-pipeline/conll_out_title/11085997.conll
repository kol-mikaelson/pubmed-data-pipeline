# Abstract
Chitinases O
are O
ubiquitous O
chitin-fragmenting O
hydrolases. O
Recently O
we O
discovered O
the O
first O
human B-Species
chitinase, O
named O
chitotriosidase, O
that O
is O
specifically O
expressed O
by O
phagocytes. O
We O
here O
report O
the O
identification, O
purification, O
and O
subsequent O
cloning O
of O
a O
second O
mammalian B-Species
chitinase. I-Species
This O
enzyme O
is O
characterized O
by O
an O
acidic O
isoelectric O
point O
and O
therefore O
named O
acidic O
mammalian B-Species
chitinase I-Species
(AMCase). B-Species
In O
rodents O
and O
man B-Species
the O
enzyme O
is O
relatively O
abundant O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
and O
is O
found O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
in O
the O
lung. O
Like O
chitotriosidase, O
AMCase B-Species
is O
synthesized O
as O
a O
50-kDa O
protein O
containing O
a O
39-kDa O
N-terminal O
catalytic O
domain, O
a O
hinge O
region, O
and O
a O
C-terminal O
chitin-binding O
domain. O
In O
contrast O
to O
chitotriosidase, O
the O
enzyme O
is O
extremely O
acid O
stable O
and O
shows O
a O
distinct O
second O
pH O
optimum O
around O
pH O
2. O
AMCase B-Species
is O
capable O
of O
cleaving O
artificial O
chitin-like O
substrates O
as O
well O
as O
crab O
shell O
chitin B-Chemical
and O
chitin B-Chemical
as O
present O
in O
the O
fungal O
cell O
wall. O
Our O
study O
has O
revealed O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
chitinolytic O
enzyme O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
and O
lung O
that O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
digestion O
and O
or O
defense. O
