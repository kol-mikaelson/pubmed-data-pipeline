# Abstract
N-Acetylglucosamine B-Chemical
is O
produced O
by O
the O
endogenous O
degradation O
of O
glycoconjugates O
and O
by O
the O
degradation O
of O
dietary O
glycoconjugates O
by O
glycosidases. O
It O
enters O
the O

by O
the O
action O
of O
N-acetylglucosamine B-Gene
kinase. I-Gene
In O
this O
study O
we O
report O
the O
isolation O

characterization O
of O
a O
cDNA O

37.3 O
kDa. O
The O
