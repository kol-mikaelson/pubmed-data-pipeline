# Abstract
The O
mammalian B-Species
multifunctional B-Gene
protein-2 I-Gene
(MFP-2, B-Gene
also O
called O
multifunctional O
enzyme O
2, O
D-bifunctional O
enzyme O
or O
17-beta-estradiol B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
type I-Gene
IV) I-Gene
was O
identified O
by O
several O
groups O
about O
a O
decade O
ago. O
It O
plays O
a O
central O
role O
in O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation O
as O
it O
handles O
most, O
if O
not O
all, O
peroxisomal O
beta-oxidation O
substrates. O
Deficiency O
of O
this O
enzyme O
in O
man B-Species
causes O
a O
severe O
developmental B-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
with O
abnormalities O
in O
several O
organs O
but O
in O
particular O
in O
the O
brain, O
leading O
to O
death B-Disease
within O
the O
first O
year O
of O
life. O
Accumulation O
of O
branched-long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
very-long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
a O
disturbed O
synthesis O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
documented O
in O
these O
patients. B-Species
A O
mouse B-Species
model O
with O
MFP-2 B-Gene
deficiency O
only O
partly O
phenocopies O
the O
human B-Species
disease. O
Although O
the O
expected O
metabolic B-Disease
abnormalities I-Disease
are O
present, O
no O
neurodevelopmental B-Disease
aberrations I-Disease
are O
observed. O
However, O
the O
survival O
of O
these O
mice B-Species
into O
adulthood O
allowed O
to O
document O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
enzyme O
for O
the O
normal O
functioning O
of O
the O
brain, O
eyes O
and O
testis. O
In O
the O
present O
review, O
the O
identification O
and O
biochemical O
characteristics O
of O
MFP-2, B-Gene
and O
the O
consequences O
of O
MFP-2 B-Gene
dysfunction O
in O
humans B-Species
and O
in O
mice B-Species
will O
be O
discussed. O
