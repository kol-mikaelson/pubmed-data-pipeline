# Abstract
Cholinephosphotransferase O
catalyses O
the O
final O
step O
in O
the O
synthesis O
of O
phosphatidylcholine B-Chemical
(PtdCho) B-Chemical
via O
the O
Kennedy O
pathway O
by O
the O
transfer O
of O
phosphocholine B-Chemical
from O
CDP-choline B-Chemical
to O
diacylglycerol. B-Chemical
Ethanolaminephosphotransferase O
catalyses O
an O
analogous O
reaction O
with O
CDP-ethanolamine B-Chemical
as O
the O
phosphobase O
donor O
for O
the O
synthesis O
of O
phosphatidylethanolamine B-Chemical
(PtdEtn). B-Chemical
Together O
these O
two O

determine O
both O
the O
