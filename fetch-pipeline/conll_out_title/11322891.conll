# Abstract
A O

(CACH) B-Gene
was O
purified O

We O
digested O
the O

with O
an O
endopeptidase O
and O
determined O
the O
N-terminal O

of O
the O
two O

From O
the O

data, O
we O
designed O
probes O
for O
RT-PCR, O
and O
amplified O
CACH B-Gene
cDNA O
from O
rat B-Species

The O
CACH B-Gene
cDNA O
contains O
a O
1668-bp O

encoding O
a O
