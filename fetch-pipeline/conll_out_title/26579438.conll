# Abstract
The O
classical O
functions O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
include O
acting O
as O
detergents O
to O
facilitate O
the O
digestion O
and O
absorption O
of O
nutrients O
in O
the O
gut. O
In O
addition, O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
also O
act O
as O
signaling O
molecules O
to O
regulate O
glucose B-Chemical
homeostasis, O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism O
and O
energy O
expenditure. O
The O
signaling O
potential O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
in O
compartments O
such O
as O
the O
systemic O
circulation O
is O
regulated O
in O
part O
by O
an O
efficient O
enterohepatic O
circulation O
that O
functions O
to O
conserve O
and O
channel O
the O
pool O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
within O
the O
intestinal O
and O
hepatobiliary O
compartments. O
Changes O
in O
hepatobiliary O
and O
intestinal O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transport O
can O
alter O
the O
composition, O
size, O
and O
distribution O
of O
the O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
pool. O
These O
alterations O
in O
turn O
can O
have O
significant O
effects O
on O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
signaling O
and O
their O
downstream O
metabolic O
targets. O
This O
review O
discusses O
recent O
advances O
in O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
inter-relationship O
between O
the O
enterohepatic O
cycling O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
the O
metabolic O
consequences O
of O
signaling O
via O
bile O
acid-activated O
receptors, O
such O
as O
farnesoid B-Gene
X I-Gene
nuclear I-Gene
receptor I-Gene
(FXR) B-Gene
and O
the O
G-protein-coupled O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
receptor O
(TGR5). O
