# Abstract
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin B-Chemical
D(3) I-Chemical
has O
anti-mitotic, O
pro-differentiating, O
and O
pro-apoptotic O
activity O
in O
tumor B-Disease
cells. O
We O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
secosteroid B-Chemical
can O
be O
synthesized O
and O
degraded O
not O
only O
in O
the O
kidney O
but O
also O
extrarenally O
in O
intestinal O
cells. O
