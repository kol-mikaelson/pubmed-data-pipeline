# Abstract
Congestive B-Disease
heart B-Disease
failure I-Disease
(CHF), B-Disease
a O
complex O
clinical O
syndrome O
with O
impaired B-Disease
cardiac I-Disease
pump I-Disease
function, I-Disease
occurs O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
mechanical O
deformities O
(pressure B-Disease
and I-Disease
volume I-Disease
overload), I-Disease
myocardial B-Disease
abnormalities I-Disease
(neurohormonal B-Disease
disorders, I-Disease
myocarditis, B-Disease
cardiomyopathies, B-Disease
inflammation B-Disease
and O
loss O
of O
cardiomyocytes) O
and O
rhythmic B-Disease
defects I-Disease
(conduction B-Disease
disturbances, I-Disease
fibrillation B-Disease
and O
tachycardia). B-Disease
Several O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
chronic O
activation O
of O
sympathetic O
and O
renin-angiotensin O
systems, O
alteration O
in O
myocardial O
substrate O
utilization, O
increase O

intracellular O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
concentration, O
development O
of O
oxidative O
stress, O
release O
of O
pro-inflammatory O
cytokines O
and O
increased O
production O
of O
endothelin O
are O
responsible O
for O
the O
maladaptive O
cardiac O
and O
subcellular O
remodeling O
depending O
upon O
the O
type O

A O
variety O
of O
pharmacological O
agents O
have O
been O
used O
to O
prevent O
the O
development O
and O
progression O
of O
CHF B-Disease
under O
different O
experimental O
and O
clinical O
settings. O
Although O
these O
drugs O
belong O
to O
specific O
classes, O
depending O
on O
their O
mechanism O
of O
action, O
individual O
drug O
biotransformation O
into O
different O
metabolites O
makes O
them O
distinct O
chemical O
moieties. O
Thorough O
understanding O
of O
biological O
effects O
of O
these O
pharmacological O
agents O
and O
metabolism O
is O
necessary O
to O
establish O
the O
basis O
for O
their O
preeminent O
use O
in O
clinical O
settings. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
review O
is O
to O
present O
a O
mechanistic O
understanding O
for O
the O
biological O
activities O
of O
different O
drugs O
used O
to O
treat O
CHF B-Disease
and O
to O
provide O
an O
insight O
of O
different O
metabolites O
formed O
after O
biotransformation O
of O
these O
chemical O
entities. O
Since O
development O
of O
CHF B-Disease
is O
a O
multifactorial O
and O
heterogeneous O
process, O
induction O
of O
combination O
regimens O
and O
improvement O
in O
patient O
compliance O
are O
the O
major O
challenges O
for O
future O
drug O
development. O
