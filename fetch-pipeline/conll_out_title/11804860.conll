# Abstract
Agmatinase, B-Gene
which O
hydrolyzes O
agmatine B-Chemical
to O
putrescine B-Chemical
and O
urea, B-Chemical
not O
only O
represents O
a O
potentially O
important O
mechanism O
for O
regulating O
the O
biological O
effects O
of O
agmatine B-Chemical
in O
mammalian O
cells O
but O
also O
represents O
an O
alternative O
to O
ornithine B-Gene
decarboxylase I-Gene
for O
polyamine B-Chemical
biosynthesis. O
We O
have O
isolated O
a O
full-length O
cDNA O
encoding O
human B-Species
agmatinase B-Gene
whose O
function O
was O
confirmed O
by O
complementation O
in O
yeast. B-Species
The O
single-copy O
human B-Species
agmatinase B-Gene
gene O
located O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
1 I-Chromosome
encodes O
a O
352-residue O
protein O
with O
a O
putative O
mitochondrial O
targeting O
sequence O
at O
the O
NH(3)-terminus. O
Human B-Species
agmatinase B-Gene
has O
about O
30% O
identity O
to O
bacterial O
agmatinases O
and O
<20% O
identity O
to O
mammalian O
arginases. O
Residues O
required O
for O
binding O
of O
Mn(2+) B-Chemical
at O
the O
active O
site O
in O
bacterial O
agmatinase B-Gene
and O
other O
members O
of O
the O
arginase O
superfamily O
are O
fully O
conserved O
in O
human B-Species
agmatinase. B-Gene
Agmatinase B-Gene
mRNA O
is O
most O
abundant O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
and O
kidney O
but O
also O
is O
expressed O
in O
several O
other O
tissues, O
including O
skeletal O
muscle O
and O
brain. O
Its O
expression O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
is O
induced O
during O
hepatitis B-Disease
B I-Disease
virus I-Disease
infection, I-Disease
suggesting O
that O
agmatinase B-Gene
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
this O
disease. O
