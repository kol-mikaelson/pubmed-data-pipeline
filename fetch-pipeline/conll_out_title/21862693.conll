# Abstract
UDP-glycosyltransferases O
(UGTs) O
are O
an O
important O
group O
of O
enzymes O
that O
participate O
in O
phase O
II O
metabolism O
of O
xenobiotics O
and O
use O
the O
cofactor O
UDP-glucuronic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
for O
the O
production O
of O
glucuronides. B-Chemical
When O
acting O
on O
molecules O
bearing O
a O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
they O
can O
form O
acyl B-Chemical
glucuronides, I-Chemical
a O
group O
of O
metabolites O
that O
has O
gained O
significant O
interest O
in O
recent O
years O
because O
of O
concerns O
about O
their O
potential O
role O
in O
drug O
toxicity. B-Disease
In O
contrast, O
reports O
about O
the O
production O
of O
drug O
acyl B-Chemical
glucosides I-Chemical
(which O
might O
also O
display O
high O
reactivity) O
have O
been O
scarce. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
discovered O
the O
formation O
of O
acyl B-Chemical
glycoside I-Chemical
metabolites O
of O
R- B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
S-ibuprofen I-Chemical
(Ibu) B-Chemical
by O
human B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
supplied O
with O
the O
cofactor O
UDP-glucose. B-Chemical
Subsequently, O
human B-Species
UGT2B7*1 O
and O
UGT2B7*2 O
recombinantly O
expressed O
in O
fission B-Species
yeast I-Species
Schizosaccharomyces B-Species
pombe I-Species
could O
be O
shown O
to O
catalyze O
these O
reactions. O
Moreover, O
we O
could O
enhance O
the O
glucoside B-Chemical
production O
rate O
in O
fission B-Species
yeast I-Species
by O
overexpressing O
the O
fission B-Species
yeast I-Species
gene O
SPCC1322.04, O
a O
potential O
UDP-glucose B-Chemical
pyrophosphorylase O
(UGPase), O
but O
not O
by O
overexpression O
of O
SPCC794.10, O
and O
therefore O
suggest O
to O
name O
this O
gene O
fyu1 O
for O
fission B-Species
yeast I-Species
UGPase1. O
It O
was O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O
pronounced O
differences O
between O
the O
two O
polymorphic O
UGT2B7 B-Gene
variants O
were O
observed O
with O
respect O
to O
acyl B-Chemical
glucoside I-Chemical
production. O
Finally, O
using O
the O
metabolic O
precursor O
[(13)C(6)]glucose, B-Chemical
we O
demonstrated O
the O
production O
of O
stable O
isotope-labeled O
reference O
standards O
of O
Ibu B-Chemical
acyl I-Chemical
glucoside I-Chemical
and O
Ibu B-Chemical
