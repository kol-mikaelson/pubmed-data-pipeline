# Abstract
Cardiomyocyte O
injury O
following O
ischemia-reperfusion O
can O
lead O
to O
cell O
death O
and O
result O
in O
cardiac B-Disease
dysfunction. I-Disease
A O
wide O
range O
of O
cardioprotective O
factors O
have O
been O
studied O
to O
date, O
but O
only O
recently O
has O
the O
cardioprotective O
role O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
specifically O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(AA), O
been O
investigated. O
This O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
can O
be O
found O
in O
the O
membranes O
of O
cells O
in O
an O
inactive O
state O
and O
can O
be O
released O
by O
phospholipases O
in O
response O
to O
several O
stimuli, O
such O
as O
ischemia. B-Disease
The O
metabolism O
of O
AA O
involves O
the O
cycloxygenase O
(COX) O
and O
lipoxygenase O
(LOX) O
pathways, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
less O
well O
characterized O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) B-Gene
monooxygenase O
pathway. O
Current O
research O
suggests O
important O
differences O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
cardiovascular O
actions O
of O
specific O
CYP B-Gene
mediated O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolites. O
For O
example, O
CYP B-Gene
mediated O
hydroxylation O
of O
AA O
produces O
20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(20-HETE) B-Chemical
which O
has O
detrimental O
effects O
in O
the O
heart O
during O
ischemia, B-Disease
pro-inflammatory O
effects O
during O
reperfusion O
and O
potent O
vasoconstrictor O
effects O
in O
the O
coronary O
circulation. O
Conversely, O
epoxidation O
of O
AA O
by O
CYP B-Gene
enzymes O
generates O
5,6-, B-Chemical
8,9-, I-Chemical
11,12- I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(EETs) B-Chemical
that O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
ischemia-reperfusion B-Disease
injury, I-Disease
have O
potent O
anti-inflammatory O
effects O
within O
the O
vasculature, O
and O
are O
potent O
vasodilators O
in O
the O
coronary O
circulation. O
This O
review O
aims O
to O
provide O
an O
overview O
of O
current O
data O
on O
the O
role O
of O
these O
CYP B-Gene
pathways O
in O
the O
heart O
with O
an O
emphasis O
on O
their O
involvement O
as O
mediators O
of O
ischemia-reperfusion B-Disease
injury. I-Disease
A O
better O
understanding O
of O
these O
relationships O
will O
facilitate O
identification O
of O
novel O
targets O
for O
the O
prevention O
and O
or O
treatment O
of O
ischemic B-Disease
heart I-Disease
