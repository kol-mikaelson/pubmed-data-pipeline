# Abstract
As O
a O
part O
of O
our O
cDNA O
project O
for O
deducing O
the O
coding O
sequence O
of O
unidentified O
human B-Species
genes, O
we O
newly O
determined O
the O
sequences O
of O
100 O
cDNA O
clones O
from O
a O
set O
of O
size-fractionated O
human B-Species
brain O
cDNA O
libraries, O
and O
predicted O
the O
coding O
sequences O
of O
the O
corresponding O
genes, O
named O
KIAA0919 O
to O
KIAA1018. O
The O
sequencing O
of O
these O
clones O
revealed O
that O
the O
average O
sizes O
of O
the O
inserts O
and O
corresponding O
open O
reading O
frames O
were O
4.9 O
kb O
and O
2.6 O
kb O
(882 O
amino O
acid O
residues), O
respectively. O
A O
computer O
search O
of O
the O
sequences O
against O
the O
public O
databases O
indicated O
that O
predicted O
coding O
sequences O
of O
87 O
genes O
contained O
sequences O
similar O
to O
known O
genes, O
53% O
of O
which O
(46 O
genes) O
were O
categorized O
as O
proteins O
relating O
to O
cell O
signaling O
communication, O
cell O
structure O
motility O
and O
nucleic O
acid O
management. O
The O
chromosomal O
locations O
of O
the O
genes O
were O
determined O
by O
using O
human-rodent O
hybrid O
panels O
unless O
their O
mapping O
data O
were O
already O
available O
in O
the O
public O
databases. O
The O
expression O
profiles O
of O
all O
the O
genes O
among O
10 O
human B-Species
tissues, O
8 O
brain O
regions O
(amygdala, O
corpus O
callosum, O
cerebellum, O
caudate O
nucleus, O

substania O
nigra, O
subthalamic O
nucleus, O
and O
thalamus), O
spinal O

were O
also O
examined O
by O
reverse O
transcription-coupled O
