# Abstract
Leukocyte B-Disease

II I-Disease
(LAD B-Disease

is O
characterized O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
fucosylated O
glycoconjugates, O
including O
selectin O

causing O
immunodeficiency B-Disease

Instead, O

the O

LAD B-Disease

we O
cloned O
12 O
cDNAs O

Caenorhabditis B-Species

encoding O
multi-spanning O
transmembrane O

them O

One O
of O
these O

re-established O
expression O

fucosylated O

high O

allowed O
us O
to O
identify O
a O
human B-Species

55% O

which O
also O

re-expression O

Both O

were O
localized O

The O

LAD B-Disease

had O
an O

Overexpression O

did O
not O
rescue O
fucosylation, O
demonstrating O
that O
the O
point O
mutation O
affected O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
protein. O
Thus, O
we O
have O
identified O
the O
first O
putative O
GDP-fucose B-Chemical
transporter, O
which O
has O
been O
highly O
conserved O
throughout O
evolution. O
A O
point O

its O
gene O
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
disease O
in O
this O
patient B-Species
