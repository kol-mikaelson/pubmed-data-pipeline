# Abstract
We O
isolated O
cDNA O
coding O
a O
new O
human B-Species
riboflavin B-Chemical
transporter I-Gene
(hRFT)3, B-Gene
which O
exhibits O
86.7 O
and O
44.1% O
amino O
acid O
identity O
with O
hRFT1 B-Gene
and O
hRFT2, B-Gene
respectively. O
It O
was O
predicted O
to O
have O
10 O
putative O
membrane-spanning O
domains. O
The O
functional O
characteristics O
of O
hRFT3 B-Gene
were O
examined O
and O
compared O
with O
those O
of O
its O
isoforms, O
hRFT1 B-Gene
and O
hRFT2. B-Gene
Real-time O
PCR O
revealed O
that O
hRFT3 B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
strongly O
expressed O
in O
the O
brain O
and O
salivary O
gland. O
hRFT1 B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
strongly O
expressed O
in O
the O
placenta O
and O
small O
intestine, O
whereas O
hRFT2 B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
most O
abundantly O
expressed O
in O
the O
testis O
and O
strongly O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
and O
prostate. O
hRFT-mediated O
uptake O
of O
[3H]riboflavin B-Chemical
was O
evaluated O
using O
human B-Species
embryonic O
kidney O
293 B-CellLine
cells O
transiently O
transfected O
with O
the O
cDNA O
coding O
each O
hRFT. O
The O
apparent O
Michaelis-Menten O
constants O
of O
hRFT1, B-Gene
hRFT2, B-Gene
and O
hRFT3 B-Gene
for O
riboflavin B-Chemical
were O
1.38, O
0.98, O
and O
0.33 O
micromol O
L, O
respectively. O
The O
hRFT-mediated O
[3H]riboflavin B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
independent O
of O
extracellular O
Na+ O
and O
Cl(-). O
Specific O
uptake O
of O
[3H]riboflavin B-Chemical
by O
hRFT2, B-Gene
but O
not O
hRFT1 B-Gene
and O
hRFT3, B-Gene
decreased O
as O
extracellular O
pH O
was O
changed O
from O
5.4 O
to O
8.4. O
The O
substrate O
specificities O
of O
the O
hRFT O
family O
were O
similar. O
hRFT-mediated O
uptake O
of O
[3H]riboflavin B-Chemical
was O
inhibited O
by O
some O
riboflavin B-Chemical
analogs, O
but O
not O
D-ribose, B-Chemical
organic O
ions, O
or O
other O
vitamins. O
The O
newly O
isolated O
hRFT3 B-Gene
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
brain O
riboflavin B-Chemical
homeostasis. O
Its O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
and O
functional O
characteristics O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
hRFT1, B-Gene
but O
not O
hRFT2. B-Gene
