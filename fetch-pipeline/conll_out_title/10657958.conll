# Abstract
Overexpression O
of O
ornithine B-Gene
decarboxylase I-Gene
(ODC) B-Gene
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
characteristic O
of O
tumor B-Disease
development O
and O
progression O
in O
humans B-Species
and O
experimental O
animals. O
Therefore, O
we O
have O
examined O
the O
effects O
of O
1, B-Chemical
3-diaminopropane I-Chemical
dihydrochloride I-Chemical
(DAP), B-Chemical
a O
potent O
inhibitor O
of O
ODC, B-Gene
on O
rat B-Species
two-stage O
urinary B-Disease
bladder I-Disease
carcinogenesis I-Disease
initiated O
with O
N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine B-Chemical
(BBN). B-Chemical
In O
experiment O
1 O
(36 O
weeks), O
6-week-old O
F344 O
male O
rats B-Species
were O
administered O
0.05% O
BBN B-Chemical
in O

for O
4 O
weeks O
and O
then O
divided O
into O
four O
groups. O
Animals O
of O

5% O
sodium B-Chemical
L-ascorbate I-Chemical
(NaAsA), B-Chemical
a O

and O
drinking O
water O
with O
or O
without O
DAP. B-Chemical
Administration O
of O
DAP B-Chemical
to O
group O
1 O
significantly O
reduced O
tumor B-Disease
size, O
multiplicity O
and O
incidence, O
particularly O
of O
papillomas, B-Disease
when O
compared O
with O
group O
2 O
values. O
DAP B-Chemical
together O
with O
NaAsA B-Chemical
(group O
3) O
also O
decreased O
tumor B-Disease
size O
relative O
to O
the O
group O

case. O
To O
determine O
the O
effects O
of O
DAP B-Chemical
on O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
bladder B-Disease
carcinogenesis I-Disease
and O
its O
mechanisms, O
a O
similar O
protocol O
was O
conducted O
(experiment O
2) O
with O
death O
after O
20 O
weeks. O
DAP B-Chemical
treatment O
caused O
complete O

(0% O
incidence) O
of O
papillary B-Disease
and I-Disease
or I-Disease
nodular I-Disease

group O
1 O
but O
was O
without O

in O
group O
3, O
as O
compared O
with O
the O
respective O
controls. O
Moreover, O
the O

by O
northern O

were O
markedly O
lower O
in O
group O

than O
in O
group O

but O
values O
were O
comparable O
for O
both O
groups O

Assessment O
of O

in O
the O

The O
results O
indicate O
that O
inhibition O
of O
ODC B-Gene
could O
reduce O
urinary B-Disease
bladder I-Disease
carcinogenesis I-Disease
in O
rats, B-Species
