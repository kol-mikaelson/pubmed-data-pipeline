# Abstract
N-Acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase O
(GlcNAc6ST) O
transfers O
sulfate B-Chemical
to O
the O
C-6 O
position O
of O
non-reducing O
N-acetylglucosamine B-Chemical
(GlcNAc) B-Chemical
residues. O
We O
cloned O
human B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
cDNAs O
encoding O
a O
novel O
GlcNAc6ST, O
designated O
as O
GlcNAc6ST-4, B-Gene
which O
showed O
sequence O
identities O
of O
26 O

other O
GlcNAc6STs. O
Human B-Species
organs O
with O
strong O
expression O
of O
the O
enzyme O
mRNA O
were O
the O
heart, O
spleen, O
and O
ovary, O
while O
in O
the O
mouse B-Species
strong O
expression O
was O
detected O
in O
the O
kidney. O
The O
enzyme O
expressed O
in O
CHO B-CellLine
cells O
preferentially O
acted O
on O
mannose-linked B-Chemical
GlcNAc, I-Chemical
while O
a O
core O
2 O
mucin-type O
oligosaccharide O
and O
an O
N-acetyllactosamine O
oligomer O
also O
served O
as O
acceptors. O
The O
distribution O
and O
the O
specificity O
of O
GlcNAc6ST O
are O
different O
from O
those O
of O
GlcNAc6STs O
