# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
The O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
L O
is O
a O
major O
nutrient O
transport O
system O
that O
is O
responsible O
for O
transport O
of O
neutral B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
including O
several O
essential B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
The O
current O
study O
attempted O
to O
investigate O
the O
