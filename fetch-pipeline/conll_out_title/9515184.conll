# Abstract
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
is O
a O
chiral O
nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drug O
(NSAID) O
of O
the O
2 O
arylpropionic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(2-APA) B-Chemical
class. O
A O
common O
structural O
feature O
of O
2-APANSAIDs B-Chemical
is O
a O
sp3-hybridised O
tetrahedral O
chiral O
carbon B-Chemical
atom O
within O
the O
propionic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
side O
chain O
moiety O
with O
the O
S-(+)-enantiomer O
possessing O
most O
of O
the O
beneficial O
anti-inflammatory O
activity. O
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
demonstrates O
marked O
stereoselectivity O
in O
its O
pharmacokinetics. O
Substantial O
unidirectional O
inversion O
of O
the O
R-(-) O
to O
the O
S-(+) O
enantiomer O
occurs O
and O
thus, O
data O
generated O
using O
nonstereospecific O
assays O
may O
not O
be O
extrapolated O
to O
explain O
the O
disposition O
of O
the O
individual O
enantiomers. O
The O
absorption O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
is O
rapid O
and O
complete O
when O
given O
orally. O
The O
area O
under O
the O
plasma O
concentration-time O
curve O
(AUC) O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
is O
dose-dependent. O
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
binds O
extensively, O
in O
a O
concentration-dependent O
manner, O
to O
plasma O
albumin. B-Gene
At O
doses O
greater O
than O
600mg O
there O
is O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
unbound O
fraction O
of O
the O
drug, O
leading O
to O
an O
increased O
clearance O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
and O
a O
reduced O
AUC O
of O
the O
total O
drug. O
Substantial O
concentrations O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
are O
attained O
in O
synovial O
fluid, O
which O
is O
a O
proposed O
site O
of O
action O
for O
nonsteroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs. O
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
is O
eliminated O
following O
biotransformation O
to O
glucuronide B-Chemical
conjugate O
metabolites O
that O
are O
excreted O
in O
urine, O
with O
little O
of O
the O
drug O
being O
eliminated O
unchanged. O
The O
excretion O
of O
conjugates O
may O
be O
tied O
to O
renal O
function O
and O
the O
accumulation O
of O
conjugates O
occurs O
in O
end-stage B-Disease
renal I-Disease
disease. I-Disease
Hepatic B-Disease
disease I-Disease
and O
cystic B-Disease
fibrosis I-Disease
can O
alter O
the O
disposition O
kinetics O
of O
ibuprofen. B-Chemical
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
is O
not O
excreted O
in O
substantial O
concentrations O
into O
breast O
milk. O
Significant O
drug O
interactions O
have O
been O
demonstrated O
for O
aspirin B-Chemical
(acetylsalicylic B-Chemical
acid), I-Chemical
cholestyramine B-Chemical
and O
methotrexate. B-Chemical
A O
relationship O
between O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
plasma O

and O
analgesic O

has O
been O
elucidated. O
