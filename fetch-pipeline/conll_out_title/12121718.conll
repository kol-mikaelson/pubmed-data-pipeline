# Abstract
Peroxisomes O
contain O
enzymes O
catalyzing O
a O
number O
of O
indispensable O
metabolic O
functions O
mainly O
related O
to O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism. O
The O
importance O
of O
peroxisomes O
in O
man O
is O
stressed O
by O
the O
existence O
of O
genetic B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
in O
which O
the O
biogenesis O
of O
the O
organelle O
is O
defective, O
leading O
to O
complex O
developmental O
and O
metabolic O
phenotypes. O
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
review O
is O
to O
emphasize O
some O
of O
the O
recent O
findings O
related O
to O
the O

peroxisomes O
and O
to O
discuss O
the O
impairment O
