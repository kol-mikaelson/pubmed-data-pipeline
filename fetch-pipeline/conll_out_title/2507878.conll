# Abstract
The O
usefulness O
of O
N-acetyl-L-tyrosine B-Chemical
(NAT) B-Chemical
and O
N-acetyl-L-cysteine B-Chemical
(NAC) B-Chemical
as O
tyrosine B-Chemical
and O
cysteine B-Chemical
precursors O
during O
intravenous O
infusion O
was O
investigated O
in O
humans. B-Species
Plasma O
levels O
and O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
NAT, B-Chemical
tyrosine, B-Chemical
NAC, B-Chemical
and O
total O
cysteine B-Chemical
were O
determined, O
and O
the O
site O
of O
deacetylation O
was O
examined O
by O
measuring O
the O
splanchnic O
and O
renal O
balances. O
Eleven O
healthy O
volunteers O
were O
given O
5 O
g O
of O
either O
NAT B-Chemical
or O
NAC B-Chemical
as O
a O
4-hour O
intravenous O
infusion. O
Plasma O
levels O
of O
NAT B-Chemical
and O
NAC B-Chemical
increased O
rapidly, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
25% O
increase O
in O
tyrosine B-Chemical
levels O
and O
a O
35% O
decrease O
in O
total O
cysteine. B-Chemical
Urinary O
excretion O
of O
NAT B-Chemical
and O
NAC B-Chemical
in O
4 O
hours O
accounted O
for O
56% O
and O
11% O
of O
the O
infused O
amount, O
respectively. O
No O
net O
production O
of O
tyrosine B-Chemical
or O
cysteine B-Chemical
was O
found O
from O
the O
splanchnic O
area, O
but O
from O
the O
kidneys O
there O
was O
a O
small O
release O
of O
both O
tyrosine B-Chemical
(10 O
+ O
- O
3 O
mumol O
min) O
and O
cysteine B-Chemical
(64 O
+ O
- O
3 O
mumol O
min). O
We O
conclude O
that O
under O
these O
conditions O
the O
usefulness O
of O
NAT B-Chemical
and O
NAC B-Chemical
as O
precursors O
for O
the O
