# Abstract
A O
variety O
of O
steroids, B-Chemical
including O
pregnenolone B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
(PREGS) B-Chemical
and O
dehydroepiandrosterone B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
(DHEAS) B-Chemical
are O
synthesized O
by O
specific O
brain O
cells, O
and O
are O
then O
delivered O
to O
their O
target O
sites, O
where O
they O
exert O
potent O
effects O
on O
neuronal O
excitability. O
The O
present O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
[(3)H]DHEAS B-Chemical
and O
[(3)H]PREGS B-Chemical
are O
relatively O
high O
affinity O
substrates O
for O
the O
organic O
solute O
transporter, O
OSTalpha-OSTbeta, O
and O
that O
the O
two O
proteins O
that O
constitute O
this O
transporter O
are O
selectively O
localized O
to O
steroidogenic O
cells O
in O
the O
cerebellum O
and O
hippocampus, O
namely O
the O
Purkinje O
cells O
and O
cells O
in O
the O
cornu O
ammonis O
region O
in O
both O
mouse B-Species
and O
human B-Species
brain. O
Analysis O
of O
Ostalpha B-Gene
and O
Ostbeta B-Gene
mRNA O
levels O
in O
mouse B-Species
Purkinje O
and O
hippocampal O
cells O
isolated O
via O
laser O
capture O
microdissection O
supported O
these O
findings. O
In O
addition, O
Ostalpha-deficient O
mice B-Species
exhibited O
changes O
in O
serum O
DHEA B-Chemical
and O
DHEAS B-Chemical
levels, O
and O
in O
tissue O
distribution O
of O
administered O
[(3)H]DHEAS. B-Chemical
OSTalpha B-Gene
and O
OSTbeta B-Gene
proteins O
were O
also O
localized O
to O
the O
zona O
reticularis O
of O
human B-Species
adrenal O
gland, O
the O
major O
region O
for O
DHEAS B-Chemical
production O
in O
the O
periphery. O
These O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
OSTalpha-OSTbeta O
is O
localized O
to O
steroidogenic O
cells O
of O
the O
brain O
and O
adrenal O
gland, O
and O
that O
it O
modulates O
DHEA B-Chemical
DHEAS B-Chemical
homeostasis, O
suggesting O
that O
it O
may O
contribute O
to O
neurosteroid O
action. O
