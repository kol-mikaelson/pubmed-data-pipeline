# Abstract
Human B-Species
glutathione B-Chemical
transferase O
M2-2 O
prevents O
the O
formation O
of O
neurotoxic B-Disease
aminochrome I-Disease
and O
dopachrome B-Chemical
by O
catalyzing O
the O
conjugation O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
and O
dopa B-Chemical
o-quinone I-Chemical
with O
glutathione. B-Chemical
NMR O
analysis O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
and O
dopa O
o-quinone-glutathione O
conjugates O
revealed O
that O
the O
addition O
of O
glutathione B-Chemical
was O
at O
C-5 O
to O
form O
5-S-glutathionyl-dopamine B-Chemical
and O
5-S-glutathionyl-dopa, B-Chemical
respectively. O
Both O
conjugates O
were O
found O
to O
be O
resistant O
to O
oxidation O
by O
biological O

agents O
such O
as O
O(2), B-Chemical
H(2)O(2), B-Chemical
and O
O(*-)(2), B-Chemical
and O
the O
glutathione B-Chemical
transferase-catalyzed O
reaction O
can O
therefore O
serve O
a O
neuroprotective O
antioxidant O
function. O
