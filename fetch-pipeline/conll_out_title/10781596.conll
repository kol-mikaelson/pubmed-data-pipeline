# Abstract
A O
novel O
human B-Species
chondroitin B-Chemical
6-O-sulfotransferase, O
designated O
C6ST-2, B-Gene
was O
identified O
by O
BLAST O

using O
the O
sequence O
of O
a O
previously O
described O
human B-Species
chondroitin B-Chemical
6-O-sulfotransferase O
(C6ST-1) B-Gene
as O
a O

The O

sequence O
revealed O
an O

for O
a O
protein O
of O
486 O

The O
amino O

sequence O
displayed O
24% O

to O
the O
human B-Species
C6ST-1, B-Gene
and O
the O
highest O
sequence O

was O
found O
in O
the O
COOH-terminal O

domain. O
The O
expression O
of O
a O

of O
the O
protein O
in O
COS-1 B-CellLine

produced O
an O

chondroitin. B-Chemical
In O

which O
are O
good O

for O
the O
C6ST-1, B-Gene
hardly O
served O
as O
acceptors. O
The O
identification O
of O
the O

indicated O
that O
the O
enzyme O
is O
a O
novel O
chondroitin B-Chemical
6-O-sulfotransferase O
(C6ST-2) B-Gene
that O
mainly O

The O

Thus, O
we O
