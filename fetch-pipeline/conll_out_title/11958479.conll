# Abstract
The O
neurotransmitter O
norepinephrine B-Chemical
is O
metabolized O
by O
monoamine O
oxidase O
into O
an O
aldehyde B-Chemical
intermediate O
that O
is O
further O
metabolized O
to O
the O
stable O
glycol B-Chemical
derivative, O
3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol B-Chemical
(DHPG). B-Chemical
In O
this O
study, O
the O
possible O
role O
of O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
in O
reducing O
this O
aldehyde B-Chemical
intermediate O
in O
human B-Species
sympathetic O
neurons O
has O
been O
examined. O
DHPG B-Chemical
is O
formed O
when O
norepinephrine B-Chemical
is O
incubated O
with O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
in O
the O
presence O
of O
monoamine O
oxidase. O
DHPG B-Chemical
metabolism O
is O
inhibited O
by O
the O
monoamine O
oxidase O
inhibitor, O
pargyline B-Chemical
which O
prevents O
the O
deamination O
of O
norepinephrine, B-Chemical
and O
by O
the O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitor O
AL B-Chemical
1576, I-Chemical
which O
inhibits O
DHPG B-Chemical
formation O
without O
affecting O
the O
deamination O
of O
norepinephrine. B-Chemical
Although O
similar O
formation O
of O
DHPG B-Chemical
was O
observed O
with O
human B-Species
liver O
aldehyde B-Chemical
reductase, I-Gene
the O
production O
of O
DHPG B-Chemical
was O
more O
effective O
with O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
than O
aldehyde B-Chemical
reductase. I-Gene
Two O
peaks O
of O
reductase O
activity O
corresponding O
to O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
and O
aldehyde B-Chemical
reductase I-Gene
were O
observed O
when O
sympathetic O
ganglia O
were O
chromatofocused. O
Molecular O
modeling O
studies O
indicate O
that O
the O
energy-minimized O
structure O
of O
3,4-dihydroxymandelaldehyde B-Chemical
bound O
to O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
is O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
glyceraldehyde B-Chemical
where O
the O
2'-hydroxyl O
group O
forms O
hydrogen O
bonds O
with O
Trp111 O
and O
NADPH. B-Chemical
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
may O
be O
important O
in O
metabolizing O
the O
potentially O
toxic O
aldehyde B-Chemical
intermediate O
formed O
from O
norepinephrine B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
sympathetic O
ganglia. O
