# Abstract
Medium-chain B-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
(MCADD) B-Disease
is O
rare O
among O
Asian O
individuals, O
and O
the O
clinical O
course O
and O
biochemical O
findings O
remain O
unclear. O
We O
report O
herein O
a O
3-year-old O
Japanese O
girl O
with O
MCADD. B-Disease
The O
diagnosis O
was O
suggested O
by O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
profiles O
and O
confirmed O
by O
enzyme O
activity O
and O
genetic O
analysis O
after O
clinical O
presentation. O
Our O
described O
method O
with O
high-performance O
liquid O
chromatography O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
allows O
quantification O
of O
levels O
of O
n-octanoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(C8-N) O
and O
other O
isomers O
(e.g. O
valproylcarnitine). B-Chemical
We O
examined O
the O
patient's O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
profiles O
in O
serum O
and O
urine O
samples O
during O
carnitine B-Chemical
loading O
and O
14-hr O
fasting O
tests O
with O
without O
carnitine B-Chemical
supplementation. O
Under O
hypocarnitinemia, B-Disease
serum O
level O
of O
C8-N O
was O
0.16 O
micromol O
l O
and O
C8-N O
decanoylcarnitine B-Chemical
(C10) O
ratio O
was O
1.8, O
which O
did O
not O
correspond O
to O
the O
diagnostic O
criteria O
for O
MCADD. B-Disease
However, O
intravenous O
carnitine B-Chemical
loading O
test O
(100 O
mg O
kg O
day O
for O
3 O
days O
and O
50 O
mg O
kg O
day O
for O
1 O
day) O
led O
to O
increased O
serum O
C8-N O
levels O
and O
urinary O
excretion O
was O
obvious, O
strongly O
suggesting O
MCADD. B-Disease
In O
the O
fasting O
test O
with O
carnitine B-Chemical
supplementation, O
marked O
production O
of O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
(C8-N O
> O
C2 O
>> O
C6 O
> O
C10) O
was O
found, O
compared O
to O
the O
fasting O
test O
without O
carnitine B-Chemical
supplementation. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
carnitine B-Chemical
supplementation O
may O
be O
useful O
for O
detoxification O
of O
accumulated O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
even O
in O
an O
asymptomatic O
state. O
Moreover, O
the O
one-point O
examination O
for O
serum O
C8-N O
level O
and O
or O
C8-N O
C10 O
ratio O
may O
make O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
MCADD B-Disease
difficult, O
particularly O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
significant O
hypocarnitinemia. B-Disease
To O
avoid O
this O
pitfall, O
attention O
should O
be O
given O
to O
serum O
levels O
of O
free O
carnitine, B-Chemical
and O
carnitine B-Chemical
loading O
may O
be O
demanded O
in O
hypocarnitinemia. B-Disease
