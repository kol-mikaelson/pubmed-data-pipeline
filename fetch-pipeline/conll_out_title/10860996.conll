GLUT8 B-Gene
is O
a O
glucose B-Chemical

for O
insulin-stimulated O

# Abstract
Mammalian B-Species
preimplantation O
blastocysts O
exhibit O
insulin-stimulated O
glucose B-Chemical
uptake O
despite O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
only O
known O
insulin-regulated O
transporter, O
GLUT4. B-Gene
We O
describe O
a O
previously O
unidentified O
member O
of O
the O
mammalian B-Species
facilitative O
GLUT O
superfamily O
that O
exhibits O
approximately O
20-25% O
identity O
with O
other O
murine B-Species
facilitative O
GLUTs. O
Insulin B-Gene
induces O
a O
change O
in O
the O
intracellular O
localization O
of O
this O
protein, O
which O
translates O
into O
increased O
glucose B-Chemical
uptake O
into O
the O
blastocyst, O
a O
process O
that O
is O
inhibited O
by O
antisense O
oligoprobes. B-Chemical
Presence O
of O
this O
transporter O
may O
be O
necessary O
for O
successful O
blastocyst O
development, O
fuel O
metabolism, O
and O
subsequent O
implantation. O
Moreover, O
the O
existence O
of O
an O
alternative O
transporter O
may O
explain O
examples O
in O
other O
tissues O
of O
insulin-regulated O
glucose B-Chemical
transport O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
GLUT4. B-Gene
