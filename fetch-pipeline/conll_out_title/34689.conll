# Abstract
The O
absorption O
of O
[3H]paracetamol B-Chemical
by O
rat B-Species
small O
intestine, O
colon O
and O
stomach O
was O
studied O
in O
vivo O
and O
in O
vitro. O
Small O
intestinal O
in O
vivo O
studies, O
using O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
drug O
concentrations, O
showed O
that O
absorption O
was O
efficient O
and O
uniform O
throughout O
the O
small O
bowel, O
no O
site O
showing O
preferential O
absorption. O
Double O
reciprocal O
and O
direct O
plots O
indicated O
first O
order O
kinetics. O
The O
pattern O
was O
not O
observed O
when O
uptake O
was O
occurring O
from O
high O
concentrations O
of O
paracetamol B-Chemical
in O
suspension. O
Gastric O
and O
colonic O
in O
vivo O
studies O
showed O
that O
there O
was O
appreciable O
absorption O
of O
[3H]paracetamol B-Chemical
from O
these O
sites. O
In O
vitro O
studies O
using O
everted O
intestinal O
sacs O
showed O
no O
effect O
on O
paracetamol B-Chemical
transfer O
when O
the O
incubation O
temperature O
was O
lowered O
to O
10 O
degrees O
C O
or O
when O
iodoacetate B-Chemical
(5 O
X O
10(-2)M) O
and O
2.4 O
dinitrophenol B-Chemical
(5 O
X O
10(-4)M) O
was O
added O
to O
the O
incubation O
medium. O
There O
was, O
however, O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
transfer O
of O
paracetamol B-Chemical
against O
a O
concentration O
gradient O
of O
10:1 O
applied O
across O
the O
mucosa. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
uptake O
of O
paracetamol B-Chemical
is O
by O
a O
passive O
transport O
process O
and O
confirm O
the O
efficiency O
of O
paracetamol B-Chemical
absorption O
observed O
indirectly O
by O
others. O
