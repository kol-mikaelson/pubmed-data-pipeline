# Abstract
We O
report O
here O
on O
the O
characterization O
of O
a O
mouse B-Species
N-system O
amino O
acid O
transporter O
protein, O
which O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
transport O
of O
glutamine. B-Chemical
This O
protein O
of O
485 O
amino O
acids O
shares O
52% O
sequence O
homology O
with O
an O
N-system O
amino O
acid O
transporter, O
mouse B-Species
N-system O
amino O
acid O
transporter O
(mNAT) B-Gene
and O
its O
orthologs. O
Because O
this O
protein O
shares O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
sequence O
homology O
and O
functional O
similarity O
to O
mNAT, B-Gene
we O
named O
it O
mNAT2. B-Gene
mNAT2 B-Gene
is O
predominately O
expressed O
in O
the O
retina O
and O
to O
a O
slightly O
lesser O
extent O
in O
the O
brain. O
In O
the O
retina, O
it O
is O
located O
in O
the O
axons O
of O
ganglion O
cells O
in O
the O
nerve O
fiber O
layer O
and O
in O
the O
bundles O
of O
the O
optic O
nerve. O
Functional O
analysis O
of O
mNAT2 B-Gene
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
oocytes O
revealed O
that O
the O
strongest O
transport O
activities O
were O
specific O
for O
l-glutamine. B-Chemical
In O
addition, O
mNAT2 B-Gene
is O
a O
Na(+)- O
and O
pH-dependent, O
high O
affinity O
transporter O
and O
partially O
tolerates O
substitution O
of O
Na(+) O
by O
Li(+). O
Additionally, O
mNAT2 B-Gene
functions O
as O
a O
carrier-mediated O
transporter O
that O
facilitates O
efflux. O
The O
unique O
expression O
pattern O
and O
selective O
glutamine B-Chemical
transport O
properties O
of O
mNAT2 B-Gene
suggest O
that O
it O
plays O
a O
specific O
role O
in O
the O
uptake O
of O
glutamine B-Chemical
involved O
in O
the O
generation O
of O
the O
neurotransmitter O
glutamate B-Chemical
in O
retina. O
