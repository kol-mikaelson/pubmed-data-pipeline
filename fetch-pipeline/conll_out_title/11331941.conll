# Abstract
For O
understanding O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
Down B-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
(DS), B-Disease
it O
is O
important O
to O
identify O
and O
characterize O
the O
genes O
on O
Chromosome O
(Chr) O
21, O
especially O
those O
in O
the O

Recently O
we O
have O
determined O
33.5 O

than O
99%) O
of O
DNA O
sequence O
of O
Chr O
21 O
and, O
from O
these O
sequence O
data, O
we O
identified O
a O
novel O
gene, O
DSCR5 B-Gene
(transcript O

0.8 O
kb), O
from O
DSCR O

combination O
of O

For O
functional O
analysis O
of O
DSCR5, B-Gene
we O
identified O
a O
mouse B-Species
homolog O
of O
the O
DSCR5 B-Gene
cDNA, O
and O
termed O
it O
mDscr5 O
(transcript O

The O

DSCR5. B-Gene
In O

hybridization O
showed O
that O
mDscr5 O
is O
predominantly O

in O
the O

To O
our O
best O
knowledge, O
no O
other O
gene O
in O
DSCR O
is O
reported O
to O
be O
expressed O
in O

so O
that O
DSCR5 B-Gene
may O
be O
the O
first O

pathophysiology O
of O
