# Abstract
Peroxisomes O
are O
single O
membrane O
bound O
organelles O
present O
in O
almost O
all O
eukaryotic O
cells, O
and O
to O
date O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
contain O
approximately O
60 O
identified O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
various O
metabolic O
pathways, O
including O
the O
oxidation O
of O
a O
variety O
of O
lipids. B-Chemical
These O
lipids B-Chemical
include O
very O
long-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
methyl B-Chemical
branched I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
prostaglandins, B-Chemical
bile-acid B-Chemical
precursors O
and O
xenobiotics O
that O
are O
either O
beta-oxidized O
or O
alpha-oxidized O
in O
peroxisomes. O
The O
recent O
identification O
of O
several O
acyl-CoA O
thioesterases O
and O
acyltransferases O
in O
peroxisomes O
has O
revealed O
their O
various O
functions O
in O
acting O
as O
auxiliary O
enzymes O
in O
alpha- O
and O
beta-oxidation O
in O
this O
organelle. O
To O
date, O
9 O
functional O
acyl-CoA O
thioesterases O
and O
acyltransferases O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
mouse B-Species
and O
4 O
functional O
acyl-CoA O
thioesterases O
and O
acyltransferases O
in O
human, B-Species
thus O
these O
enzymes O
make O
up O
a O
substantial O
portion O
of O
peroxisomal O
proteins. O
This O
review O
will O
therefore O
focus O
on O
new O
and O
emerging O
roles O
for O
these O
enzymes O
in O
assisting O
with O
the O
oxidation O
of O
various O
lipids, B-Chemical
amidation O
of O
lipids B-Chemical
for O
excretion O
from O
peroxisomes, O
and O
in O
controlling O

in O
peroxisomes. O
