# Abstract
The O
intestine O
expresses O
metabolic O
enzymes O
and O
transporters O
and O
functions O
as O
a O
barrier O
to O
orally O
administered O
xenobiotics. O
This O
study O
aimed O
to O
examine O
the O
importance O
of O
multidrug B-Gene
resistance-associated I-Gene
protein I-Gene
3 I-Gene

using O
wild-type O

mice. B-Species
The O
everted O

were O
incubated O
with O
4-methylumbelliferone B-Chemical

determined. O
The O

the O
PS(serosal) O

similar O
between O

with O
wild-type O
mice. B-Species
There O
was O
no O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O
Mrp3 B-Gene
plays O
major O
roles O
in O
the O
efflux O
