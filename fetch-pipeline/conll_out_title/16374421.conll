# Abstract
Hyperparathyroidism B-Disease
occurs O
in O
most O
patients B-Species
during O
the O
progression O
of O
chronic B-Disease
kidney I-Disease
disease I-Disease
(CKD) B-Disease
and O
one O
of O
its O
initiating O
events, O
reduced O
serum O
levels O
of O
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin B-Chemical
D, I-Chemical
results O
from O
a O
decrease O
in O
renal O
1alpha O
hydroxylase O
activity, O
which O
converts O
25-hydroxyvitamin B-Chemical
D I-Chemical
to O
its O
activated O
form. O
The O
combination O
of O
persistently O
high O
parathyroid B-Gene
hormone I-Gene
(PTH) B-Gene
and O
low O
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin B-Chemical
D I-Chemical
is O
associated O
with O
bone B-Disease

in O
patients B-Species
with O
end-stage B-Disease
kidney I-Disease

Recent O
studies O
in O
dialysis O
patients B-Species
suggest O
that O
paricalcitol, B-Chemical
a O
selective O
activator O
of O
the O
vitamin B-Chemical
D I-Chemical
receptor I-Gene
(VDR), B-Gene
is O
associated O
with O
a O
more O
favorable O
efficacy O
to O
side O
effect O
profile O
than O
calcitriol, B-Chemical
with O
less O
morbidity O
and O
better O
survival. O
One O
hypothesis O
derived O
from O
such O
studies O
suggests O
that O
systemic O
activation O
of O
VDRs O
may O
have O
direct O
effects O
on O
the O
cardiovascular O
system O
to O
decrease O
mortality O
in O
CKD. B-Disease
Although O
current O
guidelines O
for O
regulating O
serum O
calcium, B-Chemical
phosphate B-Chemical
and O
PTH B-Gene
recommend O
specific O
interventions O
at O
the O
various O
stages O
of O
CKD B-Disease
to O
prevent O
or O
postpone O
irreversible O
parathyroid B-Disease
disease I-Disease
and O
decrease O
cardiovascular O
morbidity O
and O
mortality, O
emerging O
data O
suggest O
that O
vitamin B-Chemical
D I-Chemical
therapy O
may O
prolong O
survival O
in O
this O
patient B-Species
population O
by O
mechanisms O
that O
are O
independent O
of O
calcium, B-Chemical
phosphate B-Chemical
and O
PTH. B-Gene
It O
is O
suggested O
that O
a O
re-evaluation O
of O
current O
treatment O
recommendations O
is O
needed O
and O
that O
future O
research O
should O
focus O
on O
mechanisms O
that O
distinguish O
potential O
tissue O
specific O
benefits O
of O
