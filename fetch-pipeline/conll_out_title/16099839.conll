# Abstract
Many O
endogenous O
compounds O
and O
xenobiotics O
are O
organic B-Chemical
cations I-Chemical
that O
rely O
on O
polyspecific O
organic O
cation O
transporters O
(OCTs) O
to O
traverse O
cell O
membranes. O
We O
recently O
cloned O
a O
novel O
human B-Species
plasma O
membrane O
monoamine B-Chemical
transporter O
(PMAT) O
that O
belongs O
to O
the O
equillibrative O
nucleoside O
transporter O
(ENT) O
family. O
We O
have O
reported O
previously O
that, O
unlike O
other O
ENTs, O
PMAT O
(also O
known O
as O
ENT4) B-Gene
is O
a O
Na+-independent O
and O
membrane O
potential-sensitive O
transporter O
that O
transports O
monoamine B-Chemical
neurotransmitters O
and O
the O
neurotoxin O
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium B-Chemical
(MPP+). O
These O
compounds O
are O
the O
known O
substrates O
for O
OCTs, O
which O
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
PMAT O
functions O
as O
a O
polyspecific O
transporter O
like O
the O
OCTs. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
interaction O
of O
PMAT O
with O
a O
series O
of O
structurally O
diverse O
organic B-Chemical
cations I-Chemical
using O
MDCK B-CellLine
cells O
stably O
expressing O
human B-Species
PMAT. O
Our O
study O
showed O
that O
PMAT O
interacts O
with O
many O
organic B-Chemical
cations I-Chemical
that O
have O
heterogeneous O
chemical O
structures. O
PMAT O
transports O
classic O
OCT O
substrates, O
such O
as O
tetraethylammonium, B-Chemical
guanidine, B-Chemical
and O
histamine. B-Chemical
Prototype O
OCT O
inhibitors, O
including O
cimetidine, B-Chemical
and O
type B-Chemical
II I-Chemical
cations I-Chemical
(e.g., O
quinidine, B-Chemical
quinine, B-Chemical
verapamil, O
and O
rhodamine123) O
are O
also O
PMAT O
inhibitors. O
An O
analysis O
of O
molecular O
structures O
and O
apparent O
binding O
affinities O
revealed O
that O
charge O
and O
hydrophobicity O
are O
the O
principal O
determinants O
for O
transporter-substrate O
inhibitor O
interaction. O
A O
planar O
aromatic O
mass O
seems O
to O
be O
important O
for O
high O
affinity O
interaction. O
trans-Stimulation O
and O
efflux O
studies O
demonstrate O
that O
PMAT O
is O
able O
to O
mediate O
bidirectional O
transport. O
These O
functional O
properties O
of O
PMAT O
are O
strikingly O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
the O
OCTs. O
We O
therefore O
conclude O
that O
PMAT O
can O
function O
as O
a O
polyspecific O
organic O
cation O
transporter, O
which O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
organic O
cation O
transport O
in O
vivo. O
