# Abstract
Carnitine B-Chemical
palmitoyltransferase O
I O
(CPT B-Gene
I) I-Gene
of O
rat B-Species
liver O

is O
an O
integral, O
polytopic O
protein O
of O
the O
outer O
membrane O
that O
is O
enriched O
at O
contact O
sites. O
As O
CPT B-Gene
I I-Gene
kinetics O
are O
highly O
dependent O
on O
its O
membrane O
environment, O
we O
have O
measured O
the O

of O
CPT B-Gene

enriched O
in O
either O
outer O

or O

sites. O
The O
K(m) O
for O
palmitoyl-CoA B-Chemical
was O
2.4-fold O
higher O
for O
CPT B-Gene
I I-Gene
in O
outer O

than O
that O
for O
the O
enzyme O

In O
addition, O
whereas O
in O

sites O
malonyl-CoA B-Chemical
behaved O
as O
a O
competitive O
inhibitor O
of O
CPT B-Gene
I I-Gene
with O
respect O
to O
palmitoyl-CoA, B-Chemical
in O

was O
non-competitive. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
combination O
of O
these O
changes, O
the O
IC(50) O
for O
malonyl-CoA B-Chemical
was O
severalfold O
higher O

CPT B-Gene
I I-Gene
in O

for O
the O
enzyme O

The O

malonyl-CoA, B-Chemical
the O
K(m) O
for O
carnitine, B-Chemical
and O
the O
catalytic O

were O
all O
unaffected. O
It O
is O
concluded O
that O
the O
different O
membrane O

in O

result O
in O
an O
altered O
conformation O
of O
L-CPT O

that O
specifically O
affects O
the O
long-chain O
acyl-CoA O
binding O
site. O
The O
accompanying O
changes O
in O
the O
kinetics O
of O
the O
enzyme O
provide O
an O
additional O
potent O
mechanism O
for O
the O
