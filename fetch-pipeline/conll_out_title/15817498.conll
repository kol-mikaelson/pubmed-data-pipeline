# Abstract
Mitochondrial B-Disease
fatty I-Disease
acid I-Disease
oxidation I-Disease
disorders I-Disease
(FAOD) B-Disease
are O
recessively O
inherited B-Disease
errors I-Disease
of I-Disease
metabolism. I-Disease
Newborns O
with O
FAOD B-Disease
typically O
present O
with O
hypoketotic B-Disease
hypoglycemia, I-Disease
metabolic B-Disease
acidosis, I-Disease
hepatic B-Disease
failure, I-Disease
and O
cardiomyopathy. B-Disease
Late O
presentations O
include O
episodic O
myopathy, B-Disease
neuropathy, B-Disease
retinopathy, B-Disease
and O
arrhythmias. B-Disease
Sudden B-Disease
unexpected I-Disease
death I-Disease
can O
occur O
at O
any O
age O
and O
can O
be O
confused O
with O
sudden B-Disease
infant I-Disease
death I-Disease
syndrome. I-Disease
Some O
FAOD B-Disease
are O
associated O
with O
intrauterine B-Disease
growth I-Disease
restriction, I-Disease
prematurity, O
and O
pregnancy O
complications B-Disease
in O
the O
heterozygous O
mother, O
such O
as O
severe O
preeclampsia, B-Disease
acute B-Disease
fatty I-Disease
liver I-Disease
of I-Disease
pregnancy I-Disease
(AFLP), B-Disease
or O
hemolysis, B-Disease
elevated O
liver O
enzymes, B-Disease
and O
low B-Disease
platelets I-Disease
(HELLP) B-Disease
syndrome. I-Disease
Maternal O
pregnancy O
complications B-Disease
occur O
primarily O
in O
mothers O
carrying O
a O
fetus O
with O
long-chain B-Disease
l-3-hydroxyacyl I-Disease
CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
or O
general B-Disease
trifunctional B-Disease
protein I-Disease
deficiencies. I-Disease
FAOD B-Disease
as O
a O
group O
represent O
the O
most O
common O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
of I-Disease
metabolism, I-Disease
and O
presymptomatic O
diagnosis O
of O
FAOD B-Disease
is O
the O
key O
to O
reduce O
morbidity O
and O
avoid O
mortality. O
The O
application O
of O
tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
to O
newborn O
screening O
provides O
an O
effective O
means O
to O
identify O
most O
FAOD B-Disease
patients O
presymptomatically. O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
2005, O
36 O
state O
newborn O
screening O
programs O
have O
mandated O
or O
adopted O
this O
technology O
resulting O
in O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
asymptomatic O
neonates O
with O
FAOD B-Disease
diagnosed. O
To O
ensure O
the O
long-term O
benefits O
of O
such O
screening O
programs, O
pediatricians O
and O
other O
health O
care O
providers O
must O
be O
educated O
about O
these O
disorders O
and O
their O
treatment. O
