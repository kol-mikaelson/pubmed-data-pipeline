# Abstract
In O
this O
report, O
we O
first O
cloned O
a O
cDNA O
for O
a O
protein O
that O
is O
highly O
expressed O
in O
mouse B-Species
kidney O
and O
then O
isolated O
its O
counterparts O
in O
human, B-Species
rat B-Species
hamster, B-Species
and O
guinea B-Species
pig I-Species
by O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction-based O
cloning. O
The O
cDNAs O
of O
the O
five O
species O
encoded O
polypeptides O
of O
244 O
amino O
acids, O
which O
shared O
more O
than O
85% O
identity O
with O
each O
other O
and O
showed O
high O
identity O
with O
a O
human B-Species
sperm O
34-kDa O
protein, O
P34H, B-Gene
as O
well O
as O
a O
murine B-Species
lung-specific O
carbonyl O
reductase O
of O
the O
short-chain O
dehydrogenase O
reductase O
superfamily. O
In O
particular, O
the O
human B-Species
protein O
is O
identical O
to O
P34H, B-Gene
except O
for O
one O
amino O
acid O
substitution. O
The O
purified O
recombinant O
proteins O
of O
the O
five O
species O
were O
about O
100-kDa O
homotetramers O
with O
NADPH-linked O
reductase O
activity O
for O
alpha-dicarbonyl B-Chemical
compounds, I-Chemical
catalyzed O
the O
oxidoreduction O
between O
xylitol B-Chemical
and O
l-xylulose, B-Chemical
and O
were O
inhibited O
competitively O
by O
n-butyric B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
Therefore, O
the O
proteins O
are O
designated O
as O
dicarbonyl O
l-xylulose B-Chemical
reductases O
(DCXRs). O
The O
substrate O
specificity O
and O
kinetic O
constants O
of O
DCXRs O
for O
dicarbonyl B-Chemical
compounds I-Chemical
and O
sugars B-Chemical
are O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
mammalian O
diacetyl O
reductase O
and O
l-xylulose B-Gene
reductase, I-Gene
respectively, O
and O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
DCXRs O
with O
these O
two O
enzymes O
was O
demonstrated O
by O
their O
co-purification O
from O
hamster B-Species
and O
guinea B-Species
pig I-Species
livers O
and O
by O
protein O
sequencing O
of O
the O
hepatic O
enzymes. O
Both O
DCXR B-Gene
and O
its O
mRNA O
are O
highly O
expressed O
in O
kidney O
and O
liver O
of O
human B-Species
and O
rodent O
tissues, O
and O
the O
protein O
was O
localized O
primarily O
to O
the O
inner O
membranes O
of O
the O
proximal O
renal O
tubules O
in O
murine B-Species
kidneys. O
The O
results O
imply O
that O
P34H B-Gene
and O
diacetyl O
reductase O
(EC O
) O
are O
identical O
to O
l-xylulose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
(EC O
), O
which O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
uronate O
cycle O
of O
glucose O
metabolism, O
and O
the O
unique O
localization O
of O
the O
enzyme O
in O
kidney O
suggests O
that O
it O
has O
a O
role O
other O
than O
in O
general O
carbohydrate O
metabolism. O
