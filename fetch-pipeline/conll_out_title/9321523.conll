# Abstract
Simvastatin B-Chemical
(SV) B-Chemical
is O
a O
lactone B-Chemical

for O
the O
treatment O
of O
hypercholesterolemia. B-Disease
Upon O

SV B-Chemical

liver O
microsomal O
preparations O
from O
human B-Species

four O

concluded O
that O
CYP3A B-Gene
is O
the O
major O
enzyme O
subfamily O
responsible O
for O
the O
metabolism O
of O
SV B-Chemical
by O
human B-Species

Both O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
and O
CYP3A5 B-Gene
were O
capable O
of O
catalyzing O
the O
formation O
of O
3',5'-dihydrodiol, B-Chemical
3'-hydroxy, I-Chemical
and I-Chemical

metabolites. O
However, O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
exhibited O
higher O
affinity O
(> O
3 O
fold) O
for O
SV B-Chemical
than O
CYP3A5. B-Gene
Also, O
the O

the O
metabolism O
