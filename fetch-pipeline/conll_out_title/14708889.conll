# Abstract
Organic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
analysis O
is O
used O
for O
the O
early O
detection O
exclusion O
and O
for O
the O
follow-up O
of O
inherited B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
of O
amino O
acid O

Urinary O

concentrations O
in O
417 O
healthy O
Caucasian O
children O
(1 O
day O
to O
17 O
years O
of O
age) O
were O
determined O
after O
liquid O
solid O
extraction, O
as O
their O
trimethylsilyl O
derivatives, O
by O
gas O
chromatography O
and O
mass O
spectrometry. O
Concentrations O
of O
most O
of O
the O
organic B-Chemical

adjusted O
for O
creatinine O
tend O
to O
decrease O
with O
age. O
No O
differences O
were O
found O
between O
gender O
except O
for O
the O
Krebs O
cycle O
intermediates O
in O
the O
older O
age O
groups. O
In O
neonates, O
the O
immaturity O
of O
the O
neonatal O
kidney O
led O
to O
a O
much O
larger O
variation O
of O
organic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
levels O
when O
related O
to O
creatinine. O
The O
low O

resulted O
in O
large O

This O
must O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
when O
using O
the O
data O
for O
exclusion O
or O
diagnosis O
of O
disorders. O
