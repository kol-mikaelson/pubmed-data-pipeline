# Abstract
While O
aspects O
of O
cellular O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
have O
been O
studied O
as O
early O
as O
50 O
years O
ago, O
recent O
developments O
in O
this O
rapidly O
evolving O
field O
have O
yielded O
new O
functional O
insights O
on O
the O
individual O
mechanistic O
steps O
in O
this O
process. O
The O
extremely O
low O

of O
long B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(LCFA) B-Chemical
together O
with O
the O

of O
serum O
albumin B-Gene
and O
cytoplasmic O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
binding O

for O
LCFA B-Chemical
have O
challenged O
the O
limits O
of O
technology O
in O
resolving O
the O
individual O
steps O
of O
this O
process. O
To O
date O
no O
single O
mechanism O
alone O
accounts O
for O
regulation O
of O
cellular O
LCFA B-Chemical
uptake. O
Key O
regulatory O
points O
in O
cellular O
uptake O
of O
LCFA B-Chemical
include: O
the O
aqueous O
solubility O
of O
the O
LCFA; B-Chemical
the O
driving O
force(s) O
for O
LCFA B-Chemical
entry O
into O
the O
cell O
membrane; O
the O
relative O
roles O
of O
diffusional O
and O
protein O
mediated O
LCFA B-Chemical
translocation O
across O
the O
plasma O
membrane; O
cytoplasmic O
LCFA B-Chemical
binding O
protein-mediated O
uptake O
and O
or O
intracellular O
diffusion; O
the O
activity O
of O
LCFA-CoA O
synthetase; O
and O
cytoplasmic O
protein O
mediated O
targeting O
of O
LCFA B-Chemical
or O
LCFA-CoAs O
toward O
specific O
metabolic O
pathways. O
The O
emerging O
picture O
is O
that O
the O
cell O
has O
multiple, O
overlapping O
mechanisms O
that O
assure O
adequate O
uptake O
and O
directed O
intracellular O
movement O
of O
LCFA B-Chemical
required O
for O
maintenance O
of O
physiological O
functions. O
The O
upcoming O
challenge O
is O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
new O
advances O
in O
this O
field O
to O
elucidate O
the O
differential O
interactions O
between O
these O
pathways O
in O
intact O
cells O
and O
in O
tissues. O
