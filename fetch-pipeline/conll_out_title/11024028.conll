Rh O
type O
B O
glycoprotein O

# Abstract
Ammonium B-Chemical
transporters O
play O
a O
key O
functional O
role O
in O
nitrogen B-Chemical
uptake O
and O
assimilation O
in O
microorganisms O
and O
plants; O
however, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
their O
structural O
counterpart O
in O
mammals. O
Here, O
we O
report O
the O
molecular O
cloning O
and O
biochemical O
characterization O
of O
Rh O
type O
B O
glycoproteins, O
human B-Species
RhBG B-Gene
and O
mouse B-Species
Rhbg, B-Gene
two O
new O
members O
of O
the O
Rh O
family O
with O
distinct O
tissue O
specificities. O
The O
RhBG B-Gene
orthologues O
possess O
a O
conserved O
12-transmembrane O
topology O
and O
most O
resemble O
bacterial O
and O
archaeal O
ammonium B-Chemical
transporters. O
Human B-Species
RHBG B-Gene
resides O
at O
chromosome B-Chromosome
1q21.3, I-Chromosome
which O
harbors O
candidate O
genes O
for O
medullary B-Disease
cystic I-Disease
kidney I-Disease
disease, I-Disease
whereas O
mouse B-Species
Rhbg B-Gene
is O
syntenic O
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
3. I-Chromosome
Northern O
blot O
and O
in O
situ O
hybridization O
revealed O
that O
RHBG B-Gene
and O
Rhbg B-Gene
are O
predominantly O
expressed O
in O
liver, O
kidney, O
and O
skin, O
the O
specialized O
organs O
involving O
ammonia B-Chemical
genesis, O
excretion, O
or O
secretion. O
Confocal O
microscopy O
showed O
that O
RhBG B-Gene
is O
located O
in O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
and O
in O
some O
intracellular O
granules. O
Western O
blots O
of O
membrane O
proteins O
from O
stable O
HEK293 B-CellLine
cells O
and O
from O
mouse B-Species
kidney O
and O
liver O
confirmed O
this O
distribution. O
N-Glycanase O
digestion O
showed O
that O
RhBG B-Gene
Rhbg B-Gene
has O
a O
carbohydrate B-Chemical
moiety O
probably O
attached O
at O
the O
NHS O
motif O
on O
exoloop O
1. O
Phylogenetic O
clustering, O
tissue-specific O
expression, O
and O
plasma O
membrane O
location O
suggest O
that O
RhBG B-Gene
homologous O
proteins O
are O
the O
long O
sought O
major O
ammonium B-Chemical
transporters O
in O
mammalians. O
