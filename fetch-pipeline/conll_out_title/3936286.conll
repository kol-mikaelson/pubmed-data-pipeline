# Abstract
Various O
radiolabelled O
forms O
of O
the O
amino O
acids O
cysteine, B-Chemical
methionine B-Chemical
and O
serine B-Chemical
were O
co-administered O
with O
paracetamol B-Chemical
to O
the O
hamster B-Species
to O
investigate O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
the O
thiomethyl O
metabolites O
of O
paracetamol. B-Chemical
T.l.c. O
and O
h.p.l.c. O
were O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
presence O
of O
sulphur-containing O
metabolites O
in O
the O
urine. O
Paracetamol B-Chemical
sulphate I-Chemical
and O
the O
3-cysteine, B-Chemical
mercapturate B-Chemical
and O
thiomethyl B-Chemical
derivatives I-Chemical
were O
all O
detected O
in O
urine, O
along O
with O
the O
3-methylsulphoxide B-Chemical
after O
hydrolysis. O
No O
paracetamol-3-methylsulphone B-Chemical
was O
detected. O
Both O
cysteine B-Chemical
and O
methionine B-Chemical
acted O
as O
sulphur B-Chemical
donors O
via O
glutathione. B-Chemical
The O
methyl O
group O
of O
the O
thiomethyl B-Chemical
derivatives I-Chemical
originated O
from O
methionine B-Chemical
in O
a O
reaction O
system O
believed O
to O
involve O
cysteine B-Chemical
conjugate-beta-lyase O
and O
the O
thiomethyl O
shunt. O
