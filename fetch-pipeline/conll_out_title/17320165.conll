# Abstract
Vitamin B-Chemical
E I-Chemical
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
abundant O
lipid-soluble O
antioxidant O
agents O
found O
in O
plasma O
and O
cells O
of O
higher O
mammals. O
The O
uptake, O
transport O
and O
tissue O
delivery O
of O
alpha-tocopherol, B-Chemical
a O
key O
vitamin B-Chemical
E I-Chemical
form, O
involves O
molecular, O
biochemical, O
and O
cellular O
processes O
closely O
related O
to O
overall O
lipid B-Chemical
and O
lipoprotein O
homeostasis. O
This O
review O
highlights O
recent O
findings O
that O
have O
led O
to O
a O
better O
understanding O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
E I-Chemical
transport, O
including O
intestinal O
absorption, O
hepatic O
transport, O
and O
cellular O
uptake O
of O
alpha-tocopherol B-Chemical
in O
vivo. O
This O
new O
information O
may O
be O
critical O
for O
manipulation O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
E I-Chemical
homeostasis O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
oxidative O
stress-related O
disease O

in O
humans. O
