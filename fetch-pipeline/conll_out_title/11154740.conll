# Abstract
Glucuronide B-Chemical
conjugates O
represent O
one O
of O
the O
major O
types O
of O
naturally O
occurring O
phase O
2 O
metabolites O
of O
xenobiotics O
and O
endobiotics. O
The O
process O
underlying O
their O
formation, O
glucuronidation, O
is O
normally O
considered O
detoxifying, O
because O
glucuronides B-Chemical
usually O
possess O
less O
intrinsic O
biological O
or O
chemical O
activity O
than O
their O
parent O
aglycones O
and O
they O
are O
rapid O
excreted. O
However, O
a O
number O
of O
glucuronide B-Chemical
conjugates O
are O
known O
that O
are O
active O
and O
may O
contribute O
to O
pharmacological O
activities O
or O
toxicities B-Disease
associated O
with O
their O
parent O
compounds. O
These O
include O
two O
classes O
of O
glucuronides B-Chemical
with O
electrophilic O
chemical O
reactivity O
(N-O-glucuronides B-Chemical
of O
hydroxamic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
acyl O
glucuronides B-Chemical
of O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acids) I-Chemical
and O
several O
types O
of O
glucuronides B-Chemical
that O
impart O
biological O
effects O
through O
non-covalent O
interactions O
(morphine B-Chemical
6-O-glucuronide, I-Chemical
retinoid B-Chemical
glucuronides, B-Chemical
and O
D-ring O
glucuronides B-Chemical
of O
estrogens). O
Glucuronides B-Chemical
may O
thus O
contribute O
to O
clinically O
significant O
effects, O
including O
environmental O
arylamine-induced O
carcinogenesis, B-Disease
drug B-Disease
hypersensitivity I-Disease
and O
other O
toxicities B-Disease
associated O
with O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
drugs, I-Chemical
morphine B-Chemical
analgesia, I-Chemical
and O
cholestasis B-Disease
from O
estrogens. O
This O
review O
summarizes O
the O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases B-Gene
that O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
bioactive O
glucuronides, B-Chemical
including O
their O
substrate- O
and O
tissue-specificity O
and O
genetic O
and O
environmental O
influences O
on O
their O
activity. O
This O
knowledge O
may O
be O
useful O
for O
enhancing O
the O
therapeutic O
efficacy O
and O
minimizing O
the O
risk O
of O
adverse O
effects O
associated O
with O
xenobiotics O
that O
undergo O
bioactivating O
glucuronidation O
reactions. O
