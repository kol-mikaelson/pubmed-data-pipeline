# Abstract
Despite O
the O
pivotal O
role O
of O
creatine B-Chemical
(Cr) B-Chemical
and O
phosphocreatine B-Chemical
(PCr) B-Chemical
in O
muscle O
metabolism, O
relatively O
little O
is O
known O
about O
sarcolemmal O
creatine B-Chemical
transport, O
creatine B-Chemical
transporter O
(CRT) O
isoforms, O
and O
subcellular O
localization O
of O
the O
CRT O
proteins. O
To O
be O
able O
to O
quantify O
creatine B-Chemical
transport O
across O
the O
sarcolemma, O
we O
have O
developed O
a O
new O
in O

assay O
using O
rat B-Species
sarcolemmal O
giant O
vesicles. O
The O
rat B-Species
giant O
sarcolemmal O
vesicle O
assay O
reveals O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
specific O
high-affinity O
and O
saturable O
transport O
system O
for O

The O
regulation O
of O
Cr B-Chemical
transport O
in O
giant O
vesicles O
by O

and O

as O
well O
as O
by O
phorbol B-Chemical
12-myristate I-Chemical

was O
studied. O
Two O
antibodies O
raised O
against O
COOH- O
and O
NH(2)-terminal O
synthetic O
peptides O
of O
CRT O
sequences O
both O
recognize O
two O
major O
polypeptides O
on O
Western O
blots O
with O
apparent O
molecular O
masses O
of O
70 O
and O
55 O
kDa, O
respectively. O
The O
highest O
CRT O
expression O
occurs O
in O
heart, O
brain, O
and O
kidney, O
and O
although O
creatine B-Chemical
kinase O
is O
absent O
in O
liver O
cells, O
CRT O
is O
also O
found O
in O
this O
tissue. O
Surprisingly, O

with O
specific O
anti-CRT O
antibodies, O
as O

as O
cell O

studies, O
revealed O
that O
only O
a O
minor O
CRT O
species O
with O
an O
intermediate O
molecular O
mass O
of O
approximately O
58 O
kDa O
is O
present O
in O
the O
sarcolemma, O
whereas O
the O
previously O
identified O
major O
CRT-related O
protein O
species O
of O
70 O
and O
55 O
kDa O
are O
specifically O
located O
in O
mitochondria. O
Our O
studies O
indicate O
that O
mitochondria O
may O
represent O
a O
major O
compartment O
of O
CRT O
localization, O
thus O
providing O
a O
new O
aspect O
to O
the O
current O
debate O
about O
the O
existence O
and O
whereabouts O
of O
intracellular O
Cr B-Chemical
and O
PCr B-Chemical
compartments O
that O
have O
been O
inferred O
from O
[(14)C]PCr O

recent O
