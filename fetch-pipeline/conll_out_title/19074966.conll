# Abstract
Taurine B-Chemical
is O
an O
essential O
amino O

some O
mammals O
and O
is O
conditionally O
essential O
in O
humans. B-Species
Taurine B-Chemical
is O
an O
abundant O
component O
of O
meat O
and O
fish-based O
foods O
and O
has O
been O
used O
as O
an O
oral O
supplement O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
disorders O
such O
as O
cystic B-Disease

Under O
physiological O
conditions, O
Cl(-)-dependent O
TauT-mediated O

predominates O
at O
low O
taurine B-Chemical

concentrations O
typical O

Cl(-)-independent O
PAT1-mediated O
uptake O

the O
major O
absorptive O
mechanism. O
Real-time O
PCR O

human B-Species
duodenal O

ileal O
biopsy O

demonstrates O
that O
PAT1, B-Gene
TauT B-Gene

are O
expressed O

In O
conclusion, O
this O
study O
is O
the O
first O
to O
demonstrate O
both O
taurine B-Chemical

PAT1 B-Gene
may O
be O
responsible O
for O
bulk O
