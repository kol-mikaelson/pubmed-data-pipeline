# Abstract
Intestinal O
protein O
digestion O
generates O
a O
huge O
variety O
and O
quantity O
of O
short O
chain O
peptides O
that O
are O
absorbed O
into O
intestinal O
epithelial O
cells O
by O
the O
PEPT1 B-Gene
transporter O
in O
the O
apical O
membrane O
of O
enterocytes. O
PEPT1 B-Gene
operates O
as O
an O
electrogenic O
proton O
peptide O
symporter O
with O
the O
ability O
to O
transport O
essentially O
every O
possible O
di- O
and O
tripeptide. B-Chemical
Transport O
is O
enantio-selective O
and O
involves O
a O
variable O
proton-to-substrate O
stoichiometry O
for O
uptake O
of O
neutral O
and O
mono- O
or O
polyvalently O
charged O
peptides. O
Neither O
free O
amino O
acids O
nor O
peptides O
containing O
four O
or O
more O
amino O
acids O
are O
accepted O
as O
substrates. O
The O
structural O
similarity O
of O
a O
variety O
of O
drugs O
with O
the O
basic O
structure O
of O
di- B-Chemical
or I-Chemical
tripeptides I-Chemical
explains O
the O
transport O
of O
aminocephalosporins B-Chemical
and O
aminopenicillins, B-Chemical

angiotensin-converting O
inhibitors, O
and O

by O
PEPT1. B-Gene
The O
high O
transport O
capacity O
of O
PEPT1 B-Gene
allows O
fast O
and O
efficient O
intestinal O
uptake O
of O
the O
drugs O
but O
also O
of O
amino O
acid O
nitrogen O
even O
in O
states O
of O
impaired O
mucosal O
functions. O
Transcriptional O
and O
post-transcriptional O
regulation O
of O
PEPT1 B-Gene
occurs O
in O
response O
to O
alterations O
in O
the O
nutritional O
status O
and O
in O
disease O
states, O
suggesting O
a O
prime O
role O
of O
this O
transporter O
in O
amino O
acid O
absorption. O
