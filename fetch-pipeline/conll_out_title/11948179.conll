# Abstract
5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide O
ribonucleotide O
transformylase O
IMP O
cyclohydrolase O
(ATIC) B-Gene
is O
a O
bifunctional O
protein O
possessing O
two O
enzymatic O
activities O
that O
sequentially O
catalyze O
the O
last O
two O
steps O
in O
the O
pathway O
for O
de O
novo O
synthesis O
of O
inosine B-Chemical
5'-monophosphate. I-Chemical
This O
bifunctional O
enzyme O
is O
of O
particular O
interest O
because O
of O
its O
potential O
as O
a O
chemotherapeutic O
target. O
Furthermore, O
these O
two O
catalytic O
activities O
reside O
on O
the O
same O
protein O
throughout O
all O
of O
nature, O
raising O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
there O
is O
some O
kinetic O
advantage O
to O
the O
bifunctionality. O
Rapid O

and O
steady-state O
kinetic O
techniques O
were O
used O
to O
elucidate O
the O
complete O
kinetic O
mechanism O
of O
human B-Species
ATIC. B-Gene
The O
kinetic O
simulation O
program O
KINSIM O
was O
used O
to O
model O
the O
kinetic O
data O
obtained O
in O
this O
study. O
The O
detailed O
kinetic O
analysis, O
in O
combination O
with O
kinetic O
simulations, O
provided O
the O
following O
key O
features O
of O
the O
enzyme O
reaction O
pathway. O
1) O
The O
rate-limiting O
step O
in O
the O
overall O
reaction O
(2.9 O
+ O
- O
0.4 O
s(-1)) O
is O
likely O
the O
release O
of O
tetrahydrofolate B-Chemical
from O
the O
formyltransferase O
active O
site O
or O
a O
conformational O
change O
associated O
with O
tetrahydrofolate B-Chemical
release. O
2) O
The O
rate O
of O
the O
reverse O
transformylase O
reaction O
(6.7 O
s(-1)) O
is O
approximately O
2-3-fold O
faster O
than O
the O
forward O
rate O
(2.9 O
s(-1)), O
whereas O
the O
cyclohydrolase O
reaction O
is O
essentially O
unidirectional O
in O
the O
forward O
sense. O
The O
cyclohydrolase O
reaction O
thus O
draws O
the O
overall O
bifunctional O
reaction O
toward O
the O
production O
of O
inosine O
monophosphate. O
3) O
There O
was O
no O
kinetic O
evidence O
of O
substrate O
channeling O
of O
the O
intermediate, O
the O
formylaminoimidazole O
carboxamide O
ribonucleotide, O
between O
the O
formyltransferase O
and O
the O
cyclohydrolase O
active O
sites. O
