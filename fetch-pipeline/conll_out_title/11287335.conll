# Abstract
Neurons O
contain O
a O
high-affinity O
Na(+) O
dicarboxylate O
cotransporter O
for O
absorption O
of O
neurotransmitter O
precursor O
substrates, O
such O
as O
alpha-ketoglutarate B-Chemical
and O
malate, B-Chemical
which O
are O
subsequently O
metabolized O
to O
replenish O
pools O
of O
neurotransmitters, O
including O
glutamate. B-Chemical
We O
have O
isolated O
the O
cDNA O
coding O
for O
a O
high-affinity O
Na(+) O
dicarboxylate O
cotransporter O
from O
mouse B-Species
brain, O
called O
mNaDC-3. B-Gene
The O
mRNA O
coding O
for O
mNaDC-3 B-Gene
is O
found O
in O
brain O
and O
choroid O
plexus O
as O
well O
as O
in O
kidney O
and O
liver. O
The O
mNaDC-3 B-Gene
transporter O
has O
a O
broad O
substrate O
specificity O
for O
dicarboxylates, B-Chemical
including O
succinate, B-Chemical
alpha-ketoglutarate, B-Chemical
fumarate, B-Chemical
malate, B-Chemical
and O
dimethylsuccinate. B-Chemical
The O
transport O
of O
citrate B-Chemical
is O
relatively O
insensitive O
to O
pH, O
but O
the O
transport O
of O
succinate B-Chemical
is O
inhibited O
by O
acidic O
pH. O
The O
Michaelis-Menten O
constant O
for O
succinate B-Chemical
in O
mNaDC-3 B-Gene
is O
140 O
microM O
in O
transport O
assays O
and O
16 O
microM O
at O
-50 O
mV O
in O
two-electrode O
voltage O
clamp O
assays. O
Transport O
is O
dependent O
on O
sodium, B-Chemical
although O
lithium B-Chemical
can O
partially O
substitute O
for O
sodium. B-Chemical
In O
conclusion, O
mNaDC-3 B-Gene
likely O
codes O
for O
the O
high-affinity O
Na(+) O
dicarboxylate O
cotransporter O
in O
brain, O
and O
it O
has O
some O
unusual O
electrical O
properties O
compared O
with O
the O
other O
members O
of O
the O
family. O
