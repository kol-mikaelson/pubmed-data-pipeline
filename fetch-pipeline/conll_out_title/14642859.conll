Intestinal O

# Abstract
Carbohydrates B-Chemical
are O
mostly O
digested O
to O
glucose, B-Chemical
fructose B-Chemical
and O
galactose B-Chemical
before O
absorption O
by O
the O
small O
intestine. O
Absorption O
across O
the O
brush O
border O
and O
basolateral O
membranes O
of O
enterocytes O
is O
mediated O
by O
sodium-dependent O
and O
-independent O
membrane O
proteins. O
Glucose B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
galactose B-Chemical
transport O
across O
the O
brush O
border O
occurs O
by O
a O
Na(+) O
glucose B-Chemical
(galactose) B-Chemical
co-transporter O
(SGLT1), B-Gene
whereas O
passive O
fructose B-Chemical
transport O
is O
mediated O
by O
a O
uniporter O
(GLUT5). B-Gene
The O
passive O
exit O
of O
all O
three O
sugars B-Chemical
out O
of O
the O
cell O
across O
the O
basolateral O
membrane O
occurs O
through O
two O
uniporters O
(GLUT2 B-Gene
and O
GLUT5). B-Gene
Mutations O
in O
SGLT1 B-Gene
cause O
a O
major O
defect O
in O
glucose B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
galactose B-Chemical
absorption O
(glucose-galactose B-Disease
Malabsorption), I-Disease
but O
mutations O
in O
GLUT2 B-Gene
do O
not O
appear O
to O
disrupt O
glucose B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
galactose B-Chemical
absorption. O
Studies O
on O
GLUT1 B-Gene
null O
mice B-Species
and O
Fanconi-Bickel B-Disease
patients B-Species
suggest O
that O
there O
is O
another O
exit O
pathway O
for O
glucose B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
galactose B-Chemical
that O
may O
involve O
exocytosis. O
There O
are O
no O
known O
defects O
of O
fructose B-Chemical
absorption. O
