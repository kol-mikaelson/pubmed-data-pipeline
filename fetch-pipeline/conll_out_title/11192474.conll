# Abstract
Reboxetine B-Chemical
is O
a O
novel O
selective O
norepinephrine B-Chemical
inhibitor O
that O
has O
been O
evaluated O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
patients B-Species
with O
depression. B-Disease
Reboxetine B-Chemical
is O
a O
racemic O
mixture, O
and O
the O
(S,S)-(+)-enantiomer O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
more O
potent O
inhibitor. O
However, O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
areas O
under O
the O
concentration-time O
curves O
of O
the O
(S,S)-(+)- B-Chemical
and O
(R,R)-(-)-enantiomers O
in O
vivo O
is O
approximately O
0.5. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
for O
chiral O
inversion. O
Differences O
in O
the O
clearances O
of O
the O
2 O
enantiomers O
may O
be O
explained O
by O
differences O
in O
protein O
binding. O
The O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
reboxetine B-Chemical
are O
linear O
following O
both O
single O
and O
multiple O
oral O
doses O
up O
to O
a O
dosage O
of O
12 O
mg O
day. O
The O
plasma O
concentration-time O
profile O
following O
oral O
administration O
is O
best O
described O
by O
a O
1-compartment O
model, O
and O
the O
mean O
half-life O
(approximately O
12 O
hours) O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
recommendation O
to O
administer O
the O
drug O
twice O
daily. O
Reboxetine B-Chemical
is O
well O
absorbed O
after O
oral O
administration. O
The O
absolute O
bioavailability O
is O
94.5%, O
and O
maximal O
concentrations O
are O
generally O
achieved O
within O
2 O
to O
4 O
hours. O
Food O
affects O
the O
rate, O
but O
not O
the O
extent, O
of O
absorption. O
The O
distribution O
of O
reboxetine B-Chemical
appears O
to O
be O
limited O
to O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
total O
body O
water O
due O
to O
its O
extensive O
(>97%) O
binding O
to O
plasma O
proteins. O
The O
primary O
route O
of O
reboxetine B-Chemical
elimination O
appears O
to O
be O
through O
hepatic O
metabolism. O
Less O
than O
10% O
of O
the O
dose O
is O
cleared O
renally. O
A O
number O
of O
metabolites O
formed O
through O
hepatic O
oxidation O
have O
been O
identified, O
but O
reboxetine B-Chemical
is O
the O
major O
circulating O
species O
in O
plasma. O
In O
vitro O
studies O
show O
that O
reboxetine B-Chemical
is O
predominantly O
metabolised O
by O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) I-Gene
3A4; I-Gene
CYP2D6 B-Gene
is O
not O
involved. O
Reboxetine B-Chemical
plasma O
concentrations O
are O
increased O
in O
elderly O
individuals O
and O
in O
those O
with O
hepatic B-Disease
or I-Disease
renal I-Disease
dysfunction, I-Disease
probably O
because O
of O
reduced O
metabolic O
clearance. O
In O
these O
populations, O
reboxetine B-Chemical
should O
be O
used O
with O
caution, O
and O
a O
dosage O
reduction O
is O
indicated. O
Ketoconazole B-Chemical
decreases O
the O
clearance O
of O
reboxetine, B-Chemical
so O
that O
the O
dosage O
of O
reboxetine B-Chemical
may O
need O
to O
be O
reduced O
when O
potent O
inhibitors O
of O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
are O
coadministered. O
Quinidine B-Chemical
does O
not O
affect O
the O
in O
vivo O
clearance O
of O
reboxetine, B-Chemical
confirming O
the O
lack O
of O
involvement O
of O
CYP2D6. B-Gene
There O
is O
no O
pharmacokinetic O
interaction O
between O
reboxetine B-Chemical
and O
lorazepam B-Chemical
or O
fluoxetine. B-Chemical
Reboxetine B-Chemical
at O
therapeutic O
concentrations O
has O
no O
effect O
on O
the O
in O
vitro O
activity O
of O
CYP1A2, B-Gene
2C9, I-Gene
2D6, I-Gene
2E1 I-Gene
or I-Gene
3A4. I-Gene
The O
lack O
of O
effect O
of O
reboxetine B-Chemical
on O
CYP2D6 B-Gene
and O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
was O
confirmed O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
effect O
on O
the O
metabolism O
of O
dextromethorphan B-Chemical
and O
alprazolam B-Chemical
in O
healthy O
volunteers. O
Thus, O
reboxetine B-Chemical
is O
not O
likely O
to O
affect O
the O
clearance O
of O
other O
drugs O
metabolised O
by O
CYP O
isozymes. O
