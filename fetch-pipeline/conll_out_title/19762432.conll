# Abstract
Folic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
a O
vitamin O
essential O
for O
thymidylate B-Chemical
and O
purine B-Chemical
synthesis. O
The O
human B-Species
proton-coupled B-Gene
folate I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
(hPCFT) B-CellLine
has O
recently O
been O
identified O
as O
a O
pH-dependent O
folic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
transporter, O
and O
mutations O
in O
this O
transporter O
have O
been O
linked O
to O
hereditary O
folic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
malabsorption. I-Disease
In O
this O
study, O
we O
assessed O
hPCFT-mediated O
transport O
activity O
in O
vitro, O
intersubject O
variability O
of O
intestinal O
expression O
in O
relation O
to O
blood O
folates, B-Chemical
and O
the O
relationship O
of O
proton-pump O
inhibitor O
(PPI) O
therapy O
on O
hPCFT B-CellLine
expression O
in O
vivo. O
We O
created O
a O
Madin-Darby B-CellLine
canine I-CellLine
kidney I-CellLine
strain I-CellLine
II I-CellLine
(MDCKII) B-CellLine
cell O
line O
stably O
expressing O
hPCFT B-CellLine
to O
evaluate O
its O
drug O
substrates O
and O
inhibitors. O
Intestinal O
pinch O
biopsies O
(duodenum, O
ileum, O
colon) O
were O
collected O
from O
patients B-Species
undergoing O
routine O
endoscopy O
procedures, O
and O
expressed O
levels O
of O
hPCFT B-CellLine
were O
determined O
by O
RT-PCR. O
When O
assessed O
using O
MDCKII-hPCFT O
cells, O
folic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
methotrexate B-Chemical
were O
found O
to O
be O
high-affinity O
hPCFT B-CellLine
substrates. O
Sulfasalazine B-Chemical
and O
pyrimethamine B-Chemical
were O
noted O
to O
inhibit O
hPCFT B-CellLine
activity O
with O
Ki O
values O
of O
42.3 O
and O
161.7 O
micromol O
l, O
respectively. O
hPCFT B-CellLine
was O
localized O
to O
the O
brush-border O
membrane O
of O
enterocytes O
with O
highest O
expression O
in O
the O
duodenum O
and O
reduced O
levels O
in O
the O
ileum O
and O
colon. O
When O
we O
assessed O
hPCFT B-CellLine
expression O
in O
a O
subset O
of O
patients B-Species
who O
were O
receiving O
PPI O
therapy, O
a O
near O
50% O
reduction O
in O
duodenal O
hPCFT B-CellLine
mRNA O
expression O
was O
noted. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
hPCFT B-CellLine
transporter O
activity O
can O
be O
modulated O
by O
many O
drugs O
in O
clinical O
use, O
and O
expression O
of O
this O
transporter O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
is O
higher O
in O
the O
duodenum O
than O
more O
distal O
sites O
(duodenum O
> O
ileum O
> O
colon). O
Importantly, O
we O
note O
that O
PPI O
drug O
use O
appears O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
reduced O
hPCFT B-CellLine
expression O
in O
vivo. O
