# Abstract
Pyruvate B-Chemical
is O
the O
end-product O
of O
glycolysis, O
a O
major O
substrate O
for O
oxidative O
metabolism, O
and O
a O
branching O
point O
for O
glucose, B-Chemical
lactate, B-Chemical
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
amino O
acid O
synthesis. O
The O
mitochondrial O
enzymes O
that O
metabolize O
pyruvate B-Chemical
are O
physically O
separated O
from O
cytosolic O
pyruvate B-Chemical
pools O
and O
rely O
on O
a O
membrane O
transport O
system O
to O
shuttle O
pyruvate B-Chemical
across O
the O
impermeable O
inner O
mitochondrial O
membrane O
(IMM). O
Despite O
long-standing O
acceptance O
that O
transport O
of O
pyruvate B-Chemical
into O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix O
by O
a O
carrier-mediated O
process O
is O
required O
for O
the O
bulk O
of O
its O
metabolism, O
it O
has O
taken O
almost O
40 O
years O
to O
determine O
the O
molecular O
identity O
of O
an O
IMM O
pyruvate B-Chemical
carrier. O
Our O
current O
understanding O
is O
that O
two O
proteins, O
mitochondrial O
pyruvate B-Chemical
carriers O
MPC1 B-Gene
and O
MPC2, B-Gene
form O
a O
hetero-oligomeric O
complex O
in O
the O
IMM O
to O
facilitate O
pyruvate B-Chemical
transport. O
This O
step O
is O
required O
for O
mitochondrial O
pyruvate B-Chemical
oxidation O
and O
carboxylation-critical O
reactions O
in O
intermediary O
metabolism O
that O
are O
dysregulated O
in O
several O
common O
diseases. O
The O
identification O
of O
these O
transporter O
constituents O
opens O
the O
door O
to O
the O
identification O
of O
novel O
compounds O
that O
modulate O
MPC O
activity, O
with O
potential O
utility O
for O
treating O
diabetes, B-Disease
cardiovascular B-Disease
disease, I-Disease
cancer, B-Disease
neurodegenerative B-Disease
diseases, I-Disease
and O
other O
common O
causes O
of O
morbidity O
and O
mortality. O
The O

of O
the O
present O

to O
detail O
the O
historical, O
current O
and O
future O
research O
investigations O
concerning O
mitochondrial O
pyruvate B-Chemical
transport, O
and O
discuss O
the O
possible O
consequences O
of O
altered O
pyruvate B-Chemical
transport O
in O
various O
metabolic O
tissues. O
