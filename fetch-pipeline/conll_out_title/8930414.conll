# Abstract
We O
report O
clinical O
and O
biological O
investigations O
in O
two O
patients B-Species
(twin O
brothers) O
with O
2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA B-Disease
thiolase I-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
Main O
clinical O
features O
included O
important O
staturo-ponderal O
delay, O
frequent O
infectious O
rhinopharyngitis B-Disease
episodes O
and O
an O
acute O
metabolic B-Disease
acidosis I-Disease
at O
the O
age O
of O
4 O
years, O
this O
metabolic B-Disease
decompensation I-Disease
being O
adequately O
halted O
by O
bicarbonate B-Chemical
supplementation. O
Since O
that O
age, O
patients B-Species
developed O
rather O
favorably, O
however, O
with O
persistence O
of O
the O
staturo-ponderal O
delay. O
Organicaciduria B-Disease
typical O
of O
2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA B-Disease
thiolase I-Disease
deficiency I-Disease
was O
recorded O
consisting O
of O
excessive O
excretion O
of O
tiglylglycine, B-Chemical
2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate, B-Chemical
3-hydroxyisovalerate, B-Chemical
2-methylglutaconate, B-Chemical
adipate B-Chemical
and O
2-methylacetoacetate. B-Chemical
Blood O
carnitine B-Chemical
levels O
were O
altered O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
increased O
total O
and O
esterified O
carnitine B-Chemical
concentrations O
and O
enhanced O
acyl O
free O
carnitine B-Chemical
ratios. O
Determination O
of O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
profiles O
showed O
that O
patients B-Species
excreted O
excessive O
amounts O
of O
several O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
in O
urine O
including O
propionyl, B-Chemical
butyryl, I-Chemical
isobutyryl, I-Chemical
isovaleryl, I-Chemical
2-methylbutyryl B-Chemical
and O
tiglyl-carnitine, B-Chemical
the O
latter O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
being O
prominent O

of O
a O
previously O
undescribed O
isomer O
of O
this O
carnitine B-Chemical
ester, I-Chemical
possibly O
2-ethylacrylyl-carnitine. B-Chemical
Excretion O
of O
these O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
in O
urine O
was O
increased O
in O
response O
to O
L-carnitine B-Chemical
although, O
as O
a O
whole, O
this O
therapy O
resulted O
in O
a O
less O
important O

in O
the O
case O

controls. O
Biochemical O
investigations O
on O
cultured O
skin O

confirmed O
2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA B-Disease
thiolase I-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
Through O
the O
present O
report O
on O
this O
rare O
disease O
in O
two O
siblings, O
we O
would O
like O
to O
underline O
that O
acylcarnitines B-Chemical
can O
be O
used O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA B-Disease
thiolase I-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
a O
view O

by O
acylcarnitine B-Chemical
profiles O
further O

in O
another O

adding O
this O
pathology O
to O
the O
list O
of O
beta-oxidation B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
that O
may O
be O
screened O
successfully O
through O
