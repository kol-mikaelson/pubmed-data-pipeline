# Abstract
Krebs B-Chemical
cycle O
intermediates O
such O
as O
succinate, B-Chemical
citrate, B-Chemical
and O
alpha-ketoglutarate B-Chemical
are O
transferred O
across O
plasma O
membranes O
of O
cells O
by O
secondary O
active O
transporters O
that O
couple O
the O
downhill O
movement O
of O
sodium B-Chemical
to O
the O
concentrative O
uptake O
of O
substrate. O
Several O
transporters O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
isolated O
membrane O
vesicles O
and O
cells O
based O
on O
their O
functional O
properties, O
suggesting O
the O
existence O
of O
at O
least O
three O
or O
more O
Na+ O
dicarboxylate O
cotransporter O
proteins O
in O
a O
given O
species. O
Recently, O
several O
cDNAs, O
called O
NaDC-1, B-Gene
coding O
for O
the O
low-affinity O
Na+ O
dicarboxylate O
cotransporters O
have O
been O
isolated O
from O
rabbit, B-Species
human, B-Species
and O
rat B-Species
kidney. O
The O
Na+ O
dicarboxylate O
cotransporters O
are O
part O
of O
a O
distinct O
gene O
family O
that O
includes O
the O
renal O
and O
intestinal O
Na+ O
sulfate O
cotransporters. O
Other O
members O
of O
this O
family O
include O
a O
Na(+)- O
and O
Li(+)-dependent O
dicarboxylate O
transporter O
from O
Xenopus O
intestine O
and O
a O
putative O
Na+ O
dicarboxylate O
cotransporter O
from O
rat B-Species
intestine. O
The O
current O
model O
of O
secondary O
structure O
in O
NaDC-1 B-Gene
contains O
11 O
transmembrane O
domains O
and O
an O
extracellular O
N-glycosylated O
carboxy O
terminus. O
