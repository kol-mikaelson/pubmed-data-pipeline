accompanied O
by O
RNA O
degradation O
and O
release O
of O
mononucleotides. B-Chemical
Pyrimidine O
5'-nucleotidase, O
PN-I, B-Gene
has O
been O
purified O
and O
characterized. O
The O
molecular O
and O
enzymatic O

determined O
for O
the O
enzyme O
shows O
a O
36-kDa O
and O
5.1 O

with O
no O
disulfide B-Chemical
bridges O
and O
no O

content. O
The O
activity O
is O
dependent O
on O
Mg(2+), B-Chemical
while O
it O
is O
inactivated O
by O
heavy B-Chemical
metals I-Chemical
and O

thiol-reactive O
reagents. O
PN-I B-Gene
is O
specific O
for O
pyrimidine B-Chemical
nucleoside I-Chemical

5'-AZTMP B-Chemical
and O
5'-Ara-CMP. B-Chemical
PN-I B-Gene
