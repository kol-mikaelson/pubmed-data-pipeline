# Abstract
To O
investigate O

10) I-Chromosome
in O
the O

metabolism, O
wild-type O
PTEN O
and O
its O
phosphatase-dead O
mutant O
(C124S) B-ProteinMutation
with O
or O
without O
an O
N-terminal O

were O
overexpressed O
in O
Sf-9 B-CellLine
cells O
and O
3T3-L1 B-CellLine
adipocytes O
using O
baculovirus O
and O
adenovirus B-Species
systems, O
respectively. O
When O
expressed O
in O
Sf-9 B-CellLine
cells O
together O
with O
the O
p110alpha O
catalytic O
subunit O
of O
phosphoinositide B-Chemical
3-kinase, O
myristoylated O
PTEN O
markedly O
reduced O
the O
accumulations O
of O
both O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4-bisphosphate I-Chemical
and O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4,5-trisphosphate I-Chemical
induced O
by O
p110alpha. O
In O
contrast, O
overexpression O
of O
the O
C124S B-ProteinMutation
mutants O
apparently O
increased O
these O
accumulations. O
In O
3T3-L1 B-CellLine
adipocytes, O
insulin-induced O
accumulations O
of O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4-bisphosphate I-Chemical
and O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4,5-trisphosphate I-Chemical
were O
markedly O
suppressed O
by O
overexpression O
of O
wild-type O
PTEN O
with O
the O
N-terminal O
myristoylation O
tag, O
but O
not O
by O
that O
without O
the O
tag. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
the O
C124S B-ProteinMutation
mutants O
of O
PTEN O
enhanced O
insulin-induced O
accumulations O
of O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4-bisphosphate I-Chemical
and O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4,5-trisphosphate. I-Chemical
Interestingly, O
the O
phosphorylation O
level O
of O
Akt O
at O
Thr308 O
(Akt2 O
at O
Thr309), O
but O
not O
at O
Ser473 O
(Akt2 O
at O
Ser474), O
was O
revealed O
to O
correlate O
well O
with O
the O
accumulation O
of O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4,5-trisphosphate I-Chemical
modified O
by O
overexpression O
of O
these O
PTEN O
proteins. O
Finally, O
insulin-induced O
increases O
in O
glucose B-Chemical
transport O
activity O
were O
significantly O
inhibited O
by O
the O
overexpression O
of O
myristoylated O
wild-type O
PTEN, O
but O
were O
not O
enhanced O
by O
expression O
of O
the O
C124S B-ProteinMutation
mutant O
of O
PTEN. O
Therefore, O
in O
conclusion, O
1) O
PTEN O
dephosphorylates O
both O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4-bisphosphate I-Chemical
and O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
3,4,5-trisphosphate I-Chemical
in O
vivo, O
and O
the O
C124S B-ProteinMutation
mutants O
interrupt O
endogenous O
PTEN O
activity O
in O
a O
dominant-negative O
manner. O
2) O
The O
membrane O
targeting O
process O
of O
PTEN O
may O
be O
important O
for O
exerting O
its O
function. O
3) O
Phosphorylations O
of O
Thr309 O
and O
Ser474 O
of O
Akt2 O
are O
regulated O
differently, O
and O
the O
former O
is O
regulated O
very O
sensitively O
by O
the O
function O
of O
PTEN. O
4) O
The O
phosphorylation O
level O
of O
Ser474, O
but O
not O
that O
of O
Thr309, O
in O
Akt2 O
correlates O
well O
with O
insulin-stimulated O
glucose B-Chemical
transport O
activity O
in O
3T3-L1 B-CellLine
adipocytes. O
5) O
The O
activity O
of O
endogenous O
PTEN O
may O
not O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
transport O
activity O
in O
3T3-L1 B-CellLine
adipocytes. O
