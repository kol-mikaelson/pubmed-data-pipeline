# Abstract
Five O
distinct O
organic O
anion O
transporter O
cDNAs, O
hOAT1-5, B-Gene
were O
isolated O
from O
human B-Species
liver O
and O
kidney. O
hOAT1, B-Gene
2, I-Gene
and I-Gene
3 I-Gene
are O
homologous O
to O
their O
respective O
rat B-Species
orthologues O
OAT1-3, B-Gene
whereas O
hOAT4 B-Gene
and I-Gene
5 I-Gene
are O
novel O
clones O
that O
have O
not O
been O
identified O
in O
other O
species. O
hOAT1- B-Gene
and O
hOAT3-transfected O
cells O
showed O
uptake O
of O
p-aminohippurate B-Chemical
and O
fluorescein. B-Chemical
Cells O
expressing O
hOAT2 B-Gene
showed O
uptake O
of O
p-aminohippurate, B-Chemical
methotrexate, B-Chemical
cAMP, B-Chemical
and O
alpha-ketoglutarate. B-Chemical
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
indicated O
differential O
tissue O

for O
the O
transporter O
transcripts. O
These O
results O
indicate O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
family O
of O
organic O

transporting O
proteins O
in O
humans B-Species
