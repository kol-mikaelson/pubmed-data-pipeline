# Abstract
Alpha-lipoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(LA) O
is O
used O
in O
dietary O
supplements O
or O
food O
with O
antioxidative O
functions. O
The O
mechanism O
for O
the O
intestinal O
absorption O
of O
alpha-lipoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
was O
investigated O
in O
this O
study O
by O
using O
human B-Species
intestinal O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cell O
monolayers. O
LA O
was O
rapidly O
transported O
across O
the O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cell O
monolayers, O
this O
transport O
being O
energy-dependent, O
suggesting O
transporter-mediated O
transport O
to O
be O
the O
mechanism O
involved. O
The O
LA O
transport O
was O
strongly O
dependent O
on O
the O
pH O
value, O
being O
accelerated O
in O
the O
acidic O
pH O
range. O
Furthermore, O
such O
monocarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
as O
benzoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
medium-chain O
fatty O
acids O
significantly O
inhibited O
LA O
transport, O
suggesting O
that O
a O
proton-linked O
monocarboxylic O
acid O
transporter O
(MCT) O
was O
involved O
in O
the O
intestinal O
transport O
of O
LA. O
The O
conversion O
of O
LA O
to O
the O
more O
antioxidative O
dihydrolipoic O
acid O
was O
also O
apparent O
during O
the O
transport O
process. O
