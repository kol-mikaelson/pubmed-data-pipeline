# Abstract
The O
HNK-1 B-Gene
carbohydrate B-Chemical
is O
expressed O
on O
various O
cell O
adhesion O
molecules O
in O
the O
nervous O
system O
and O
is O
suggested O
to O
play O
a O
role O
in O
cell-cell O
and O
cell-substrate O
interactions. O
Here O
we O
describe O
the O
isolation O
of O
a O
cDNA O
encoding O
human B-Species
glucuronyltransferase O
(GlcAT-P), B-Gene
which O
is O
a O
key O
enzyme O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
of O
the O
HNK-1 B-Gene
carbohydrate. B-Chemical

the O
cDNA O
sequence O
predicted O
a O
type O

of O
334 O
amino O

Human B-Species
GlcAT-P B-Gene
was O
98.2% O
identical O
with O
rat B-Species
GlcAT-P B-Gene

amino O
acid O
sequence, O
the O
exception O
being O
the O
length O
of O
the O
cytoplasmic O
tail. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
indicated O
that O
human B-Species
GlcAT-P B-Gene
is O
expressed O
mainly O
in O
the O
brain. O
There O
is O
a O
single O
copy O
of O
the O
human B-Species
GlcAT-P B-Gene
gene O
(HGMW-approved O

B3GAT1), O
and O
it O
was O
mapped O
to O
chromosome O
11q25. O
