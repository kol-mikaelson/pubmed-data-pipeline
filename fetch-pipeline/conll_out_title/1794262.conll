# Abstract
Gliclazide B-Chemical
is O
a O
sulphonylurea B-Chemical
drug O
with O
an O
intermediate O
half-life O
of O
around O
11 O
hours. O
It O
is O
extensively O
metabolised, O
and O
renal O
clearance O
accounts O
for O
only O
4% O
of O
total O
drug O
clearance. O
The O
molecule O
contains O
an O
azabicyclo-octyl O
group O
which O
confers O
special O
properties O
on O
the O
basic O
sulphonylurea B-Chemical
moiety. O
Gliclazide B-Chemical
stimulates O
insulin B-Gene
secretion O
through O
the O
beta O
cell O
sulphonylurea B-Chemical
receptor, O
and O
possibly O
through O
a O
direct O
effect O
on O
intracellular O
calcium B-Chemical
transport. O
It O
specifically O
improves O
the O
abnormal O
first O
phase O
insulin B-Gene
release O
in O
type B-Disease
2 I-Disease
diabetes, I-Disease
and O
also O
has O
an O
effect O
on O
the O
second O
phase. O
This O
pattern O
of O
insulin B-Gene
release O
is O
thought O
to O
explain O
the O
lower O
incidence O
of O
hypoglycaemic B-Disease
episodes I-Disease
and O
weight B-Disease
gain I-Disease
compared O
with O
some O
other O
sulphonylureas. B-Chemical
There O
is O
also O
a O
reduction O
in O
hepatic O
glucose B-Chemical
production O
and O
improvement O
in O
glucose B-Chemical
clearance, O
without O
changes O
in O
insulin B-Gene
receptors. O
This O
suggests O
a O
possible O
post-receptor O
effect O
on O
insulin B-Gene
action, O
perhaps O
by O
stimulation O
of O
hepatic O
fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase O
and O
muscle O
glycogen O
synthase. O
Gliclazide B-Chemical
reduces O
platelet B-Disease
adhesion, I-Disease
aggregation O
and O
hyperactivity B-Disease
and O
increases O
fibrinolysis. O
These O
actions, O
thought O
to O
be O
independent O
of O
its O
hypoglycaemic O
activity, O
may O
make O
gliclazide B-Chemical
useful O
in O
halting O
the O
progression O
of O
diabetic B-Disease
microangiopathy. I-Disease
