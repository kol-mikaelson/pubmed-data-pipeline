Argininosuccinate B-Chemical

The O
three-dimensional O

Q286R B-ProteinMutation

This O

the O

human B-Species

the O

suggests O
that O
the O

sterically O

occur. O
The O
comparison O
also O
suggests O
that O
residues O
other O
than O
R33, O
F333, O
and O
D337 O
play O
a O
role O
in O
maintaining O
the O
structural O

of O
domain O

and O
reinforces O
the O
suggestion O
that O
residues O
74-89 O
require O
a O
particular O
conformation O
for O
catalysis. O
The O
electron O

enabled O
the O
structure O

residues O
6-18 O

the O

Residues O

and O
15-18 O
are O

type O
IV O
beta-turns O
and O
are O
connected O
by O
a O
loop. O
The O
conformation O

is O
stabilized, O
in O
part, O
by O
a O
salt O
bridge O
between O
the O

Although O
the O
disease O

mutation O
R12Q B-ProteinMutation

disrupt O
this O
salt O
bridge, O
it O
is O
unclear O
why O
this O
mutation O
has O
such O
a O
significant O
effect O
on O
the O
catalytic O

residues O
