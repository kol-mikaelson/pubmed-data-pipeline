# Abstract
In O
mammals, O
peroxisomes O
are O
involved O
in O
breakdown O
of O
very O

fatty I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
prostanoids, B-Chemical
pristanic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
dicarboxylic B-Chemical

and O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
intermediates. O
Substrate O

studies O
of O
the O
four O
different O
beta-oxidation O
steps O
in O
rat B-Species
and O
or O
in O
man B-Species
demonstrate O
that O
these O
substrates O
are O
degraded O
by O
separate O
beta-oxidation O
systems O
composed O
of O
different O
enzymes. O
In O
both O
species, O
the O
enzymes O
acting O
on O
straight B-Chemical
chain I-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
are O
palmitoyl-CoA B-Gene
oxidase, I-Gene
an O
L-specific O
multifunctional O
protein O
(MFP-1) O
and O
a O
dimeric O
thiolase. O
In O
liver, O
bile B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
intermediates O
undergo O
one O
cycle O
of O
beta-oxidation O
catalyzed O
by O
trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA B-Gene

(in O
rat), B-Species
or O

(in O

protein O
(MFP-2) O
and O
SCPX-thiolase. O
Finally, O
pristanic B-Chemical

in O
rat B-Species

by O
pristanoyl-CoA B-Chemical

Although O
in O
man B-Species
a O
pristanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
oxidase I-Gene
gene O
is O
present, O
so O
far O
its O
product O
has O
not O

Hence, O
pristanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
is O

be O
desaturated O
in O
human B-Species

Due O
to O
the O
stereospecificity O
of O
the O
oxidases O
acting O
on O
2-methyl-branched O
substrates, O
an O
additional O
enzyme, O
2-methylacyl-CoA B-Gene
racemase, I-Gene
is O
required O
for O
the O
degradation O
of O
pristanic B-Chemical

and O

of O
