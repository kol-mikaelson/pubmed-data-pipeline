# Abstract
Membrane O
transporters O
enable O
efficient O
cellular O
metabolism, O
aid O
in O
nutrient O
sensing, O
and O
have O
been O
associated O
with O
various O
diseases, O
such O
as O
obesity B-Disease
and O
cancer. B-Disease
Genome-scale O
metabolic O
network O
reconstructions O
capture O
genomic, O
physiological, O
and O
biochemical O
knowledge O
of O
a O
target O
organism, O
along O
with O
a O
detailed O
representation O
of O
the O
cellular O
metabolite O
transport O
mechanisms. O
Since O
the O
first O
reconstruction O
of O
human B-Species
metabolism, O
Recon O
1, O
published O
in O
2007, O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
in O
the O
field O
of O
metabolite O
transport. O
Recently, O
we O
published O
an O
updated O
reconstruction, O
Recon O
2, O
which O
significantly O
improved O
the O
metabolic O
coverage O
and O
functionality. O
Human B-Species
metabolic O
reconstructions O
have O
been O
used O
to O
investigate O
the O
role O
of O
metabolism O
in O
disease O
and O
to O
predict O
biomarkers O
and O
drug O
targets. O
Given O
the O
importance O
of O
cellular O
transport O
systems O
in O
understanding O
human B-Species
metabolism O
in O
health O
and O
disease, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
coverage O
of O
transport O
systems O
for O
various O
metabolite O
classes O
in O
Recon O
2. O
We O
will O
review O
the O
current O
knowledge O
on O
transporters O
(i.e., O
their O
preferred O
substrates, O
transport O
mechanisms, O
metabolic O
relevance, O
and O
disease O
association O
for O
each O
metabolite O
class). O
We O
will O
assess O
missing O
coverage O
and O
propose O
modifications O
and O
additions O
through O
a O
transport O
module O
that O
is O
functional O
when O
combined O
with O
Recon O
2. O
This O
information O
will O
be O
valuable O
for O
further O
refinements. O
These O
data O
will O
also O
provide O
starting O
points O
for O
further O
experiments O
by O
highlighting O
areas O
of O
incomplete O
knowledge. O
This O
review O
represents O
the O
first O
comprehensive O
overview O
of O
the O
transporters O
involved O
in O
central O
metabolism O
and O
their O
transport O
mechanisms, O
thus O
serving O
as O
a O
compendium O
of O
metabolite O
transporters O
specific O
for O
human B-Species
metabolic O
reconstructions. O
