# Abstract
Three O
new O
metabolites O
of O
medium-chain O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation, O
3-, B-Chemical
6- I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
7-hydroxyoctanoyl I-Chemical
beta-D-glucuronide, I-Chemical
were O
identified O
in O
the O
urine O
of O
six O
infants O
who O
were O
fed O
a O
diet O
enriched O
in O
medium-chain B-Chemical
triglycerides I-Chemical
(MCT). B-Chemical
Glucuronides B-Chemical
were O
extracted O
from O
the O
urine O
by O
organic O
solvent O
extraction O
with O
ethyl B-Chemical
acetate I-Chemical
and O
by O
solid-phase O
extraction O
on O
Sep-Pak O
C18 O
cartridges. O
The O
compounds O
of O
interest O
were O
also O
purified O
from O
the O
organic O
solvent O
extract O
by O
preparative O
one-dimensional O
thin-layer O
chromatography. O
Cleavage O
of O
the O
glucuronides B-Chemical
was O
achieved O
by O
either O
alkaline O
hydrolysis O
or O
enzymatic O
hydrolysis O
with O
beta-D-glucuronidase. B-Gene
The O
analyses O
of O
the O
trimethylsilylated O

were O
performed O
both O
by O

and O
by O
gas O

(GC O
MS). O
The O
structure O
of O
the O
hydroxyoctanoic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
was O
proved O
by O
comparison O
of O
their O
mass O
spectra O
with O
those O
of O
reference O
substances. O
Authentic O
6-hydroxyoctanoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
was O
synthesized. O
The O
presence O
of O
6-hydroxyoctanoyl B-Chemical
glucuronide I-Chemical
shows O
that O
in O
addition O
to O
beta-oxidation, O
omega-oxidation O
and O
(omega-1)-hydroxylation, O
medium-chain O
fatty B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
can O
be O
oxidized O
at O
the O
omega-2 O
position. O
The O
conjugation O
of O
medium-chain O
hydroxy-monocarboxylic O
acids O
with O
glucuronic O

has O
not O
been O
described O
in O
