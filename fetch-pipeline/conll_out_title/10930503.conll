responsible O
for O
the O
system O
A O
amino O

that O
is O
known O
to O

most O
human B-Species
tissues. O
This O
transporter, O
designated O
ATA2 B-Gene
for O
amino B-Gene

A2, I-Gene
was O
cloned O
from O
the O
human B-Species
hepatoma B-Disease

HepG2. B-CellLine
Human B-Species
ATA2 B-Gene
(hATA2) O
consists O
of O
506 O
amino O

and O
exhibits O
a O

rat B-Species
ATA2. B-Gene
hATA2-specific O
mRNA O
is O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
in O
human B-Species
tissues. O
When O
expressed O
in O
mammalian O
cells, O
hATA2 O
mediates O
Na+-dependent O
transport O
of O
alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric O
acid, O
a O

for O
system O
A. O
The O
transporter O

acids. O
It O
is O
pH-sensitive O
and O
Li+-intolerant. O
The O
