# Abstract
Peroxisomal O
delta B-Gene
3, I-Gene
delta I-Gene
2-enoyl-CoA I-Gene
isomerase I-Gene
(EC O
5.3.3.8) O
was O
studied O
in O
the O
liver O
of O
rats B-Species
treated O
with O
clofibrate. B-Chemical
The O
mitochondrial O
and O
peroxisomal O
isoenzymes O
were O
separated O
chromatographically O
and O
the O
peroxisomal O
isomerase O
purified O
to O
apparent O
homogeneity. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
isomerization O
of O
3-enoyl-CoA B-Chemical
esters, I-Chemical
the O
purified O
protein O
also O
catalyzed O
hydration O
of O
trans-2-enoyl-CoA B-Chemical
and O
oxidation O
of O
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. B-Chemical
Incubation O
of O
the O
purified O
protein O
with O
trans-3-decenoyl-CoA, B-Chemical
NAD+, B-Chemical
and O
Mg2+ B-Chemical
resulted O
in O
an O
increase O
in O
absorbance O
at O
303 O
nm, O
indicating O
the O
formation O
of O
3-ketoacyl-CoA. B-Chemical
The O
protein O
purified O
was O
monomeric, O
with O
an O
estimated O
molecular O

of O
78,000. O
In O
immunoblotting O
it O
was O
recognized O
by O
the O

peroxisomal O
bifunctional O
protein O

rat B-Species
liver. O

of O
the O
peroxisomal O

In O
control O

the O
peroxisomal O
