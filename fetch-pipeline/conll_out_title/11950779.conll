The O

By O

the O

Studies O

that O
both O
UGT1A1 B-Gene

capable O
of O
forming O
the O
glucuronide B-Chemical

lactones B-Chemical
for O
all O
three O
statins. O
Kinetic O

Of O

The O

SVA, B-Chemical
upon O

Since O

was O
high O
under O

the O

suggest O
that O

previously O
in O

following O
administration O
of O
SVA B-Chemical
to O
animals O
or O
of O
AVA B-Chemical
or O
CVA B-Chemical
to O
animals O
and O
humans, B-Species
might O
originate, O
at O
least O
in O
part, O
from O
the O
corresponding O
acyl B-Chemical
glucuronide I-Chemical
conjugates. O
Thus, O
acyl B-Chemical
glucuronide I-Chemical
formation, O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
common O
metabolic O
pathway O
for O
the O
hydroxy B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
forms O
of O
statins, O
may O
play O
an O
important, O
albeit O
previously O
unrecognized, O
role O
in O
the O
conversion O
of O
active O
HMG-CoA B-Gene

to O
their O
latent O
delta-lactone B-Chemical
forms. O
