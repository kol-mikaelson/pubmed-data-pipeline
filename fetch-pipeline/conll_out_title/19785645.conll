# Abstract
Membrane O
transporters O
are O
now O
recognized O
as O
important O
determinants O
of O
the O
transmembrane O
passage O
of O
drugs. O
Organic O
anion O
transporting O
polypeptides O
(OATP) O
form O
a O
family O
of O
influx O
transporters O
expressed O
in O
various O
tissues O
important O
for O
pharmacokinetics. O
Of O
the O
11 O
human B-Species
OATP O

OATP1B1, B-Gene
OATP1B3 B-Gene
and O
OATP2B1 B-Gene
are O
expressed O
on O
the O
sinusoidal O
membrane O
of O
hepatocytes O
and O
can O
facilitate O
the O

uptake O
of O

OATP1A2 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
on O
the O
luminal O
membrane O
of O
small O
intestinal O

and O

the O

potentially O

these O

Several O
clinically O
used O
drugs O
have O
been O
identified O
as O
substrates O
of O
OATP O
transporters O
(e.g. O
many O
statins O
are O
substrates O
of O
OATP1B1). B-Gene
Some O
drugs O
may O
inhibit O
OATP O
transporters O
(e.g. O
cyclosporine) B-Chemical
causing O
pharmacokinetic O
drug-drug O
interactions. O
Moreover, O
genetic O
variability O
in O
genes O
encoding O
OATP O

can O
result O
in O
marked O
inter-individual O

in O
pharmacokinetics. O
For O
