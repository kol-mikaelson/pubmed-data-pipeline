# Abstract
Phenylalanine B-Chemical
and O
homogentisate B-Chemical
increase O
the O
concentration O
of O
succinylacetoacetate B-Chemical
and O
succinylacetone B-Chemical
both O
in O
serum O
and O
urine O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia I-Disease
and O
therefore O
increase O
the O
excretion O
of O
5-aminolevulinate. B-Chemical
Both O
phenylalanine B-Chemical
and O
homogentisate B-Chemical
cause O
a O
tubular O
proteinuria B-Disease
which O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
our O
hypothesis O
that O
their O
metabolites O
maleylacetoacetate B-Chemical
and O
fumarylacetoacetate B-Chemical
are O
the O
toxic O
compounds O
in O
hereditary B-Disease
tyrosinemia. I-Disease
The O
patient B-Species
with O
the O
highest O
excretion O
of O
succinylacetoacetate B-Chemical
and O
succinylacetone B-Chemical
has O
the O
slightest O
tubular O
proteinuria B-Disease
whereas O
the O
one O
with O
the O
lowest O
excretion O
of O
these O
compounds O
has O
the O
more O
pronounced O
tubular O
proteinuria. B-Disease
It O
is O
suggested O
that O
this O
is O
caused O
by O
a O
difference O
in O
the O
ability O
to O
reduce O
the O
presumed O
toxic O
compounds O
fumarylacetoacetate B-Chemical
and O
maleylacetoacetate, B-Chemical
i.e. O
the O
precursors O
of O
succinylacetoacetate. B-Chemical
