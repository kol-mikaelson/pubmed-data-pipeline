# Abstract
The O
human B-Species
organic B-Gene
anion I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
1 I-Gene
(hOAT1) B-Gene
facilitates O
the O
basolateral O
entry O
of O
organic B-Chemical
anions I-Chemical
such O
as O
endogenous O
metabolites, O
xenobiotics, O
and O
drugs O
into O
the O
proximal O
tubule O
cells. O
In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
investigated O
the O
general O
occurrence O
of O
hOAT1 B-Gene
isoforms O
in O
the O
kidneys O
and O
performed O
functional O
characterizations. O
Kidney O
specimens O
of O
10 O
patients B-Species
were O
analyzed O
by O
reverse O
transcription-polymerase O
chain O
reaction. O
We O
detected O
hOAT1-2 B-Gene
as O
the O
main O
transcript O
in O
almost O
all O
patients, B-Species
and O
weak O
transcripts O
of O
hOAT1-1, B-Gene
hOAT1-3, B-Gene
and O
hOAT1-4 B-Gene
in O
many O
of O
them. O
An O
evaluation O
of O
the O
renal O
distribution O
showed O
all O
four O
mRNAs O
mostly O
restricted O
to O
the O
cortex. O
Western O
blot O
analysis O
of O
membrane O
fractions O
from O
two O
kidney O
specimens O
yielded O
two O
bands O
corresponding O
to O
the O
observed O
mRNA O
expression, O
suggesting O
hOAT1-3 B-Gene
and O
hOAT1-4 B-Gene
to O
be O
expressed O
on O
the O
protein O
level O
in O
vivo. O
This O
observation O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
immunofluorescence O
analyses O
of O
all O
four O
cloned O
hOAT1 B-Gene
isoforms O
transiently O
transfected O
in O
COS B-CellLine

cells. O
Functional O
characterizations O
did O
not O
show O
any O
transport O
activity O
of O
hOAT1-3 B-Gene
and O
hOAT1-4 B-Gene
for O
the O
tested O
substrates. O
Cotransfection O
studies O
of O
each O
of O
them O

hOAT1-1 B-Gene

not O
alter O
fluorescein B-Chemical
uptake O

no O
regulatory O

of O
these O
isoforms. O
Further O
