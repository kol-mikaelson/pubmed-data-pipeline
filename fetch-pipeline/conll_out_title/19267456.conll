# Abstract
Peroxynitrite B-Chemical
is O
formed O
by O
the O
very O
fast O
reaction O
of O
nitric B-Chemical
oxide I-Chemical
and O
superoxide B-Chemical
radicals, O
a O
reaction O
that O
kinetically O
competes O
with O
other O
routes O
that O
chemically O
consume O
or O
physically O
sequester O
the O
reagents. O
It O
can O
behave O
either O
as O
an O
endogenous O
cytotoxin O
toward O
host O
tissues O
or O
a O
cytotoxic O
effector O
molecule O
against O
invading O
pathogens, O
depending O
on O
the O
cellular O
source O
and O
pathophysiological O
setting. O
Peroxynitrite B-Chemical
is O
in O
itself O
very O
reactive O
against O
a O
few O
specific O
targets O
that O
range O
from O
efficient O
detoxification O
systems, O
such O
as O
peroxiredoxins, O
to O
reactions O
eventually O
leading O
to O
enhanced O
radical O
formation O
(e.g., O
nitrogen B-Chemical
dioxide I-Chemical
and O
carbonate B-Chemical
radicals), O
such O
as O
the O
reaction O
with O
carbon B-Chemical
dioxide. I-Chemical
Thus, O
the O
chemical O
biology O
of O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
is O
dictated O
by O
the O
chemical O
kinetics O
of O
its O
formation O
and O
decay O
and O
by O
the O
diffusion O
across O
membranes O
of O
the O
species O
involved, O
including O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
itself. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
most O
durable O
traces O
of O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
passing O
(such O
as O
3-nitrotyrosine) B-Chemical
are O
derived O
from O
radicals O
formed O
from O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
by O
routes O
that O
represent O
extremely O
low-yield O
processes O
but O
that O
have O
potentially O
critical O
biological O
consequences. O
Here O
we O
have O
reviewed O
the O
chemical O
kinetics O
of O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
as O
a O
biochemical O
transient O
species O
in O
order O
to O
estimate O
its O
rates O
of O
formation O
and O
decay O
and O
then O
its O
steady-state O
concentration O
in O
different O
intra- O
or O
extracellular O
compartments, O
trying O
to O
provide O
a O
quantitative O
basis O
for O
its O
reactivity; O
additionally, O
we O
have O
considered O
diffusion O
across O
membranes O
to O
locate O
its O
possible O
effects. O
Finally, O
we O
have O
assessed O
the O
most O
successful O
attempts O
to O
intercept O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
by O
pharmacological O
intervention O
in O
their O
potential O
to O
increment O
the O
existing O
biological O
defenses O
that O
routinely O
deal O
with O
this O
cytotoxin. O
