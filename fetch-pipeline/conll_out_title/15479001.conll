# Abstract
It O
was O
previously O
reported O
that O
m-coumaric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
m-hydroxyphenylpropionic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(mHPP), B-Chemical
and O
3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(DHPP) B-Chemical
are O
major O
metabolites O
of O
ingested O
caffeic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
formed O
by O
gut O
microflora O
and O
would O
be O
transported O
by O
the O
monocarboxylic B-Gene
acid I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
(MCT). B-Gene
We O
have O
directly O
measured O
their O
absorption O
characteristics O
in O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
using O
a O
coulometric O
detection O
method O
involving O
HPLC-ECD. O
The O
proton-coupled O
directional O
transport O
of O
m-coumaric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
mHPP, B-Chemical
and O
DHPP B-Chemical
was O
observed, O
and O
the O
transport O
was O
inhibited O
by O
an O
MCT B-Gene
substrate. O
The O
permeation O
of O
m-coumaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
mHPP B-Chemical
was O
concentration-dependent O
and O
saturable: O
The O
Michaelis O
constant O
for O
m-coumaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
mHPP B-Chemical
was O
32.5 O
and O
12.9 O
mM, O
respectively, O
and O
the O
maximum O
velocity O
for O
m-coumaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
mHPP B-Chemical
was O
204.3 O
and O
91.2 O
nmol O
(min)(-1) O
(mg O
protein)(-1), O
respectively. O
By O
contrast, O
the O
permeation O
of O
DHPP B-Chemical
was O
nonsaturable O
even O
at O
30 O
mM O
and O
was O
inversely O
correlated O
with O
the O
paracellular O
permeability O
of O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells. O
Our O
results O
demonstrate O
that O
these O
compounds O
are O
absorbed O
by O
the O
MCT, B-Gene
although O
DHPP B-Chemical
is O
mainly O
permeated O
across O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
via O
the O
paracellular O
pathway. O
MCT-mediated O
absorption O
of O
phenolic B-Chemical
compounds I-Chemical

and O
their O
colonic O
metabolites O
would O
exert O
significant O

on O
human B-Species
