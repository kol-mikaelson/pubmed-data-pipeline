# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
With O
the O
advent O
of O
high-throughput O
targeted O
metabolic O
profiling O
techniques, O
the O
question O
of O
how O
to O
interpret O
and O
analyze O
the O
resulting O
vast O
amount O
of O
data O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
important. O
In O
this O
work O
we O
address O
the O
reconstruction O
of O
metabolic O
reactions O
from O
cross-sectional O
metabolomics O
data, O
that O
is O
without O
the O
requirement O
for O
time-resolved O
measurements O
or O
specific O
system O
perturbations. O
Previous O
studies O
in O
this O
area O
mainly O
focused O
on O
Pearson O
correlation O
coefficients, O
which O
however O
are O
generally O
incapable O
of O
distinguishing O
between O
direct O
and O
indirect O
metabolic O
interactions. O
RESULTS: O
In O
our O
new O
approach O
we O
propose O
the O
application O
of O
a O
Gaussian O
graphical O
model O
(GGM), O
an O
undirected O
probabilistic O
graphical O
model O
estimating O
the O
conditional O
dependence O
between O
variables. O
GGMs O
are O
based O
on O
partial O
correlation O
coefficients, O
that O
is O
pairwise O
Pearson O
correlation O
coefficients O
conditioned O
against O
the O
correlation O
with O
all O
other O
metabolites. O
We O
first O
demonstrate O
the O
general O
validity O
of O
the O
method O
and O
its O
advantages O
over O
regular O
correlation O
networks O
with O
computer-simulated O
reaction O
systems. O
Then O
we O
estimate O
a O
GGM O
on O
data O
from O
a O
large O
human B-Species
population O
cohort, O
covering O
1020 O
fasting O
blood O
serum O
samples O
with O
151 O
quantified O
metabolites. O
The O
GGM O
is O
much O
sparser O
than O
the O
correlation O
network, O
shows O
a O
modular O
structure O
with O
respect O
to O
metabolite O
classes, O
and O
is O
stable O
to O
the O
choice O
of O
samples O
in O
the O
data O
set. O
On O
the O
example O
of O
human B-Species
fatty O
acid O
metabolism, O
we O
demonstrate O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
high O
partial O
correlation O
coefficients O
generally O
correspond O
to O
known O
metabolic O
reactions. O
This O
feature O
is O
evaluated O
both O
manually O
by O
investigating O
specific O
pairs O
of O
high-scoring O
metabolites, O
and O
then O
systematically O
on O
a O
literature-curated O
model O
of O
fatty O
acid O
synthesis O
and O
degradation. O
Our O
method O
detects O
many O
known O
reactions O
along O
with O
possibly O
novel O
pathway O
interactions, O
representing O
candidates O
for O
further O
experimental O
examination. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
In O
summary, O
we O
demonstrate O
strong O
signatures O
of O
intracellular O
pathways O
in O
blood O
serum O
data, O
and O
provide O
a O
valuable O
tool O
for O
the O
unbiased O
reconstruction O
of O
metabolic O
reactions O
from O
large-scale O
metabolomics O
data O
sets. O
