# Abstract
Adenylyl O
cyclases O
(Acs) O
and O
VI O
are O
the O
predominant O
form O
of O
Acs O
in O
mammalian O
heart O
where O
they O
are O
part O
of O
the O
beta-adrenergic O
pathway. O
Up O
to O
now, O
the O
sequences O
for O
both O
enzymes O
from O
human B-Species
tissues O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
reported. O
We O
investigated O
the O
mRNA O
expression O
AC B-Gene
V I-Gene
and I-Gene
VI I-Gene
in O
human B-Species
colon, O
heart, O
liver, O
lung O
and O
MNL. B-Disease
Partial O
cDNAs O
of O
human B-Species
types O
V O
and O
VI O
Acs O
were O
amplified O
by O
PCR O
using O
oligonucleotides O
derived O
from O
the O
cytoplasmatic O
domain O
sequences O
of O
the O
corresponding O
enzymes O
from O
dog B-Species
heart. O
Primers O
derived O
from O
the O
human B-Species
sequence O
were O
used O
to O
detect O
the O
mRNAs O
corresponding O
to O
both O
Acs. O
For O
quantification O
of O
mRNAs O
we O
constructed O
internal O
standards O
for O
competitive O
quantitative O
reverse O
transcriptase O
PCR O
(RT-PCR). O
Both O
types O
of O
transcripts O
could O
be O
found O
in O
all O
investigated O
tissues O
except O
MNL B-Disease
where O
only O
type O
VI O
could O
be O
detected. O
Further O
we O
demonstrated O
a O
more O
than O
60 O
times O
higher O
amount O
of O
AC O
V-mRNA O
in O
human B-Species
heart O
compared O
to O
AC O
VI-mRNA. O
