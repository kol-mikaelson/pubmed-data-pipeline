# Abstract
Alanine B-Chemical
aminotransferase I-Gene
(ALT) O
catalyzes O
the O
reversible O
transamination O
between O
alanine B-Chemical
and O
2-oxoglutarate B-Chemical
to O
form O
pyruvate B-Chemical
and O
glutamate, B-Chemical
and O
thereby O
has O
a O
key O
role O
in O
the O
intermediary O
metabolism O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
and O
amino O
acids. O
Two O
ALT O
isoenzymes O
are O
known O
to O
exist, O
but O
only O
one O
ALT O
gene O
has O
been O
cloned, O
GPT. B-Gene
In O
this O
study, O
we O
cloned O
a O
homolog O
of O
GPT B-Gene
and O
named O
it O
GPT2, B-Gene
and O
the O
corresponding O
protein O
ALT2. B-Gene
GPT2 B-Gene
shares O
69% O
identity O
and O
78% O
similarity O
at O
the O
protein O
level O
to O
the O
previously O
cloned O
GPT. B-Gene
The O
human B-Species
gene O
GPT2 B-Gene
encodes O
a O
3.9-kb O
mRNA, O
consists O
of O
12 O
exons, O
spanning O
approximately O
50 O
kb O
of O
the O
genome, O
and O
maps O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
16q12.1. I-Chromosome
GPT2 B-Gene
and O
GPT B-Gene
differ O
in O
mRNA O
expression O
in O
that O
GPT2 B-Gene
is O
highly O
expressed O
in O
muscle, O
fat, O
and O
kidney, O
whereas O
GPT B-Gene
is O
mainly O
expressed O
in O
kidney, O
liver, O
and O
heart. O
In O
addition, O
GPT2 B-Gene
seems O
to O
be O
the O
predominant O
form O
of O
GPT B-Gene
at O
the O
mRNA O
level O
in O
these O

Expression O
of O
ALT2 B-Gene
protein O
in O
Escherichia B-Species

produced O
a O
functional O
recombinant O
enzyme O
that O
catalyzes O
alanine B-Chemical
transamination, O
confirming O
that O
the O
enzyme O
is O
an O
ALT. O
The O
more O
abundant O
expression O
of O
GPT2 B-Gene
than O
GPT, B-Gene
especially O
in O
muscle O
and O
fat, O
suggests O
a O
unique O
and O
previously O
unrecognized O
role O
of O
this O
gene O
product O
in O
glucose, B-Chemical

acid I-Chemical
metabolism O
and O
homeostasis. O
