# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Currently, O
5-aminolevulinic O
acid-based O
photodynamic O
diagnosis O
(ALA-PDD) O
is O
used O
to O
detect O
tumors B-Disease
during O
surgery O
and O
exploit O
tumor-specific O
accumulation O
of O
protoporphyrin B-Chemical
IX I-Chemical
(PpIX) B-Chemical
after O
administration O
of O
ALA. B-Chemical
In O
a O
recent O
study, O
we O
showed O
that O
the O
human B-Species
ATP-binding B-Gene
cassette I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
ABCG2 B-Gene
plays O
a O
key O
role O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
PpIX B-Chemical
as O
a O
specific O
exporter. O
However, O
coproporphyrin O
III O
(CPIII) O
was O
also O
detected O
in O
urine O
after O
ALA B-Chemical
administration O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
tumor, B-Disease
indicating O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
CPIII O
transporter. O
METHODS: O
We O
used O
two O
lines O
of O
human B-Species
gastric B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
cells O
to O
measure O
the O
ALA-induced O
porphyrin B-Chemical
metabolism. O
Intracellular O
and O
extracellular O
porphyrin B-Chemical
levels O
and O
expressions O
of O
transporter O
were O
determined. O
RESULTS: O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
showed O
that O
although O
ABCG2 B-Gene
did O
not O
transport O
CPIII, O
plasma O
membrane O
ABCB6 B-Gene
did. O
Moreover, O
under O
conditions O
of O
hypoxia, B-Disease
the O
expression O
of O
ABCB6 B-Gene
in O
plasma O
membrane O
was O
upregulated, O
resulting O
in O
increased O
extracellular O
CPIII O
concentrations. O
CONCLUSION: O
These O
data O
indicate O
that O
the O
expression O
of O
ABCB6 B-Gene
in O
plasma O
membrane O
is O
important O
for O
porphyrin B-Chemical
accumulation O
after O
ALA B-Chemical
administration, O
including O
hypoxic B-Disease
conditions. O
