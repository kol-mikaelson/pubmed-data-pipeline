# Abstract
In O
this O
inestigation, O
a O
determination O
of O
the O
isoenzyme O
contents O
of O
LDH O
and O
HBD B-Gene
activities O
in O
lactate O
dehydrogenase O
preparations O
and O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
interaction O
of O
these O
preparations O
with O
NAD B-Chemical
analogues O
were O
examined. O
The O
results O
obtained O
were O
as O
follows. O
1. O
The O
activity O
ratio O
between O
oxidation O
and O
reduction O
in O
LDH O
reaction O
is O
shown O
to O
be O
similar O
in O
both O
H4 B-CellLine
and O
M4 O
preparations, O
whereas O
for O
HBD B-Gene
activity, O
the O
ratio O
seems O
to O
be O
lower O
in O
the O
M4 O
preparation O
than O
in O
H4(H4 O
M O

2). O
2. O
NAD B-Chemical
and O
its O
analogues O
(NXD, O
TNAD, B-Chemical
and O
TNXD) B-Chemical
are O
shown O
to O
be O
useful O
coenzymes O
for O
the O
LDH O
reaction, O
while O
3-acetyl B-Chemical
derivatives O
appear O
to O
be O
unsuitable O
for O
this O
purpose O
because O
of O
their O
lower O
activity. O
HBD B-Gene
activity O
with O
3-acetyl B-Chemical
NXD I-Chemical
is O
shown O
to O
be O
higher O
than O
with O
TNAD B-Chemical
or O
TNXD. B-Chemical
among O
these O
NAD B-Chemical
analogues, O
3-acetyl B-Chemical
NXD I-Chemical
gives O
the O
highest O
HBD B-Gene
activity, O
especially O
in O
the O
M4 O
preparation. O
3. O
The O
LDH O
activity O
of O
H4 B-CellLine
relative O
to O
M4 O
preparations O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
maximal O
when O
450 O
mM O
lactic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
with O
NAD B-Chemical
or O
15 O
mM O
lactic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
with O
TNXD B-Chemical
are O
used. O
Under O
these O
conditions, O
the O
contents O
of O
LDH O
subunits O
can O
be O
estimated O
with O
considerable O
reliability. O
As O
to O
HBD B-Gene
activity, O
the O
content O
of O
LDH O
subunit O
having O
HBD B-Gene
activity O
has O
been O
estimated O
by O
determing O
the O
enzyme O
activity O
under O
conditions O
in O
which O
either O
300 O
mM O
2-hydroxybutyrate B-Chemical

3-acetyl B-Chemical
NXD I-Chemical
or O
15 O
mM O
2-hydroxybutyrate B-Chemical
