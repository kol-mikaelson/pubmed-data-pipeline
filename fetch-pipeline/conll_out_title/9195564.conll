# Abstract
Serum O
5-S-cysteinyl B-Chemical
dopa I-Chemical
(5-S-CD), B-Chemical
circulating O
intercellular B-Gene
adhesion I-Gene
molecule-1 I-Gene
(cICAM-1) O
and O
soluble O
interleukin-2 O
receptor O
(sIL-2R) O
have O
each O
been O
reported O
as O
useful O
markers O
for O
melanoma B-Disease
progression. O
To O
assess O
the O
clinical O
relevance O
of O
these O
three O
markers, O
we O
simultaneously O
assayed O
their O
serum O
levels O
in O
30 O
Japanese O
melanoma B-Disease
patients. B-Species
Pre-surgical O
serum O
levels O
of O
5-S-CD, B-Chemical
cICAM-1 O
and O
sIL-2R O
were O
elevated O
in O
six, O
13 O
and O
five O
patients B-Species
respectively. O
These O
abnormal O
values O
returned O
to O
normal O
after O
curative O
surgery O
in O
most O
of O
the O
patients, B-Species
suggesting O
a O
direct O
relationship O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
primary O
tumour. B-Disease
Pre-surgical O
values O
of O
these O
three O
markers, O
either O
individually O
or O
in O
combination, O
did O
not O
predict O
the O
development O
of O
subsequent O
metastases. B-Disease
The O
sequential O
measurements O
of O
the O
three O
markers O
in O
eight O
patients B-Species
who O
had O
relapse O
after O
surgery O
showed O
that O
serum O
5-S-CD B-Chemical
is O
the O
most O
useful O
marker O
for O
disease O
progression, O
although O
it O
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
melanin-producing O
ability O
of O
individual O
recurrent O
tumours. B-Disease
sIL-2R O
seemed O
to O
reflect O
in O
vivo O
activation O
of O
the O
host O
immune O
system O
and O
was O
a O
good O
indicator O
for O
predicting O
occult O
metastasis B-Disease
in O
selected O
cases. O
Circulating O
ICAM-1 B-Gene
levels O
were O
less O
relevant O
to O
the O
clinical O
disease O
course O
in O
our O
cases, O
although O
they O
tended O
to O
increase O
strikingly O
after O
liver B-Disease
metastasis. I-Disease
Our O
results O
in O
this O
limited O
number O
of O
cases O
show O
that O
the O
significance O
of O
the O
three O
markers O
varied O
with O
the O
individual O
and O
suggest O
that O
the O
simultaneous O
measurement O
of O
these O
markers O
may O
facilitate O
the O
early O
detection O
of O
metastases B-Disease
and O
proper O
therapeutic O
intervention. O
