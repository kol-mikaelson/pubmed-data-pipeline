# Abstract
In O
the O
intestinal O
lumen O
thiamine B-Disease
is O
in O
free O
form O
and O
very O
low O
concentrations. O
Absorption O
takes O
place O
primarily O
in O
the O
proximal O
part O
of O
the O
small O
intestine O
by O
means O
of O
a O
dual O
mechanism, O
which O
is O
saturable O
at O
low O
(physiological) O
concentrations O
and O
diffusive O
at O
higher. O
Thiamine B-Disease
undergoes O
intracellular O
phosphorylation O
mainly O
to O
thiamine B-Disease
pyrophosphate, I-Chemical
while O
at O
the O
serosal O
side O
only O
free O
thiamine B-Disease
is O
present. O
Thiamine B-Disease
uptake O
is O
enhanced O
by O
thiamine B-Disease
deficiency, I-Disease
and O
reduced O
by O
thyroid O
hormone O
and O
diabetes. B-Disease
The O
entry O
of O
thiamine B-Disease
into O
the O
enterocyte, O
as O
evaluated O
in O
brush O

membrane O
vesicles O
of O
rat B-Species
small O
intestine O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
H+ O
gradient, O
is O
Na+- O
and O
biotransformation-independent, O
completely O
inhibited O
by O
thiamine B-Disease
analogs O
and O
reduced O
by O
ethanol B-Chemical
administration O
and O
aging. O
The O
transport O
involves O
a O
saturable O
mechanism O
at O
low O
concentrations O
of O
vitamin O
and O
simple O
diffusion O
at O
higher. O
Outwardly O
oriented O
H+ O
gradients O
enhance O
thiamine B-Disease
transport, O
whose O
saturable O
component O
is O
a O
Na+-independent O
electroneutral O
uphill O
process O
utilizing O
energy O
supplied O
by O
the O
H+ O
gradient, O
and O
involving O
a O
thiamine B-Disease
H+ O
1:1 O
stoichiometric O
exchange. O
The O
exit O
of O
thiamine B-Disease
from O
the O
enterocyte, O
as O
evaluated O
in O
basolateral O
membrane O
vesicles, O
is O
Na+-dependent, O
directly O
coupled O
to O
ATP B-Chemical
hydrolysis O
by O
Na+-K+-ATPase, O
and O
inhibited O
by O
thiamine B-Disease
analogs. O
Transport O
of O
thiamine B-Disease
by O
renal O
brush O
border O
membrane O
vesicles O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
intestinal O
as O
far O
as O
both O
H+ O
gradient O
influence O
and O
specificity O
are O
concerned. O
In O
the O
erythrocyte O
thiamine B-Disease
transport O
is O
a O
Na+-independent, O
electroneutral O
process O
yet O
with O
two O
components: O
saturable, O
prevailing O
at O
low O
thiamine B-Disease
concentrations, O
and O
diffusive O
at O
higher. O
The O
saturable O
(specific) O
component O
is O
missing O
in O
patients B-Species
of O
the O
rare O
disease O
known O
as O
thiamine-responsive B-Disease
megaloblastic I-Disease
anaemia I-Disease
(TRMA), B-Disease
producing O
a O
general O
disturbance O
of O
thiamine B-Disease
transport O

The O
TRMA B-Disease

Recently, O
the O
thiamine B-Disease
