# Abstract
In O
recent O
years, O
several O
inherited B-Disease
human I-Disease
disorders I-Disease
caused O
by O
defects O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis O
have O
been O
identified. O
These O
are O
characterized O
by O
malformations, B-Disease
multiple B-Disease
congenital I-Disease
anomalies, I-Disease
mental B-Disease
and I-Disease
growth I-Disease
retardation I-Disease
and O
or O
skeletal B-Disease
and I-Disease
skin I-Disease
abnormalities I-Disease
indicating O
a O
pivotal O
role O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
in O
morphogenesis O
and O
embryonic O
development. O
The O
first O
recognized O
and O
most O
common O
of O
these O
developmental O
disorders O
is O
Smith-Lemli-Opitz B-Disease
syndrome, I-Disease
an O
autosomal O
recessive O
trait O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
DHCR7 B-Gene
gene O
resulting O
in O
a O
deficiency O
of O
the O
encoded O
sterol B-Chemical
Delta(7)-reductase, O
alternatively O
called O
7-dehydrocholesterol B-Chemical
reductase I-Gene
(EC O
1.3.1.21). O
This O
enzyme O
catalyzes O
the O
final O
step O
in O
cholesterol B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
which O
is O
the O
reduction O
of O
the O
Delta(7) B-Chemical
double O
bond O
of O
7-dehydrocholesterol B-Chemical
to O
produce O
cholesterol. B-Chemical
