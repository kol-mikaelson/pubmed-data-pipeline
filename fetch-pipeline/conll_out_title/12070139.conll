# Abstract
This O
study O
demonstrates O
that O
the O
steroidogenic O
acute O
regulatory O
protein-related O
lipid O
transfer O
(START) O
domain-containing O
protein, O
MLN64, B-Gene
participates O
in O
intracellular O
cholesterol B-Chemical
trafficking. O
Analysis O
of O
the O
intracellular O
itinerary O
of O
MLN64 B-Gene
and O
MLN64 B-Gene
mutants O
tagged O
with O
green O
fluorescent O
protein O
showed O
that O
the O
N-terminal O
transmembrane O
domains O
mediate O
endocytosis O
of O
MLN64 B-Gene
from O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
to O
late O
endocytic O
compartments. O
MLN64 B-Gene
constitutively O
traffics O
via O
dynamic O
NPC1-containing O
late O
endosomal O
tubules O
in O
normal O
cells; O
this O
dynamic O
movement O
was O
inhibited O
in O
cholesterol-loaded O
cells, O
and O
MLN64 B-Gene
is O
trapped O
at O
the O
periphery O
of O
cholesterol-laden O
lysosomes. O
The O
MLN64 B-Gene
START O
domain O
stimulated O
free O
cholesterol B-Chemical
transfer O
from O
donor O
to O
acceptor O
mitochondrial O
membranes O
and O
enhanced O
steroidogenesis O
by O
placental O
mitochondria. O
Expression O
of O
a O
truncated O
form O
of O
MLN64 B-Gene
(DeltaSTART-MLN64), O
which O
contains O
N-terminal O
transmembrane O
domains O
but O
lacks O
the O
START O
domain, O
caused O
free O
cholesterol B-Chemical
accumulation O
in O
lysosomes O
and O
inhibited O
late O
endocytic O
dynamics. O
The O
DeltaSTART-MLN64 O
dominant O
negative O
protein O
was O
located O
at O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
cholesterol-laden O
lysosomes. O
This O
dominant O
negative O
mutant O
suppressed O
steroidogenesis O
in O
COS B-CellLine

expressing O
the O
mitochondrial O
cholesterol B-Chemical
side O
chain O

system. O
We O
conclude O
that O
MLN64 B-Gene
participates O
in O
mobilization O
and O
utilization O
of O
lysosomal O
cholesterol B-Chemical
by O
virtue O
of O
the O
START O
