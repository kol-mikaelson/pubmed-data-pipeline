# Abstract
The O
enzymes O
of O
mitochondrial O
beta-oxidation O
are O
thought O
to O
be O
organized O
in O
at O
least O
two O
functional O
complexes, O
a O
membrane-bound, O
long-chain-specific O
beta-oxidation O
system O
and O
a O
matrix O
system O
consisting O
of O
soluble O
enzymes O
with O
preferences O
for O
medium-chain O
and O
short-chain O
substrates. O
This O
hypothesis O
is O
supported O
by O
the O
observation O
that O
the O
inactivation O
of O
long-chain O
3-ketoacyl-CoA O
thiolase O
by O
4-bromotiglic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(4-bromo-2-methylbut-2-enoic B-Chemical
acid) I-Chemical
causes O
the O
complete O
inhibition O
of O
palmitate B-Chemical
beta-oxidation O
even O
though O
3-ketoacyl-CoA O
thiolase, O
which O
acts O
on O
3-ketopalmitoyl-CoA, B-Chemical
remains O
partly O
active. O
The O
observed O
substrate O
specificities O
of O
long-chain B-Gene
acyl-CoA I-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(LCAD) O
and O
very-long-chain O
acyl-CoA O
dehydrogenase O
prompt O
the O
suggestion O
that O
LCAD O
is O
a O
functional O
component O
of O
the O
long-chain-specific O
beta-oxidation O
system. O
Altogether, O
a O
view O
is O
emerging O
of O
the O
organization O
of O
beta-oxidation O
enzymes O
in O
mitochondria O
that O
supports O
the O
idea O
of O
intermediate O
channelling O
and O
explains O
the O
apparent O
absence O
of O
true O
intermediates O
of O
beta-oxidation O
from O
mitochondria. O
