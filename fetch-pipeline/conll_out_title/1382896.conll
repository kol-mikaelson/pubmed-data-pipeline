# Abstract
A O
specific O
and O
sensitive O
assay O
for O
quantifying O
the O
immunosuppressant O
FK506 B-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolites O
in O
blood O
and O
urine O
was O
developed. O
32-O-Acetyl B-Chemical
FK506 B-Chemical
was O
synthesized O
and O
used O
as O
internal O
standard. O
FK506 B-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolites O
were O
purified O
from O
the O
samples O
by O
solid-liquid O
extraction O
and O
were O
injected O
into O
a O
high-performance O
liquid O
chromatographic O
(HPLC) O
system O
linked O
to O
a O
mass O
spectrometer O
(MS) O
by O
particle-beam O
interface. O
The O

they O
were O
detected O
by O
negative O

The O
limit O
of O
detection O

in O
a O
standard O

and O
the O
limit O
of O
quantification O

of O
blood). O
The O

drugs O
were O
found. O
