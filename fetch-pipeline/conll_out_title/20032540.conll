# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
The O
multidrug O
resistance O
proteins O
(MRPs) O
form O
a O
subfamily O
within O
the O
ATP O
binding O
cassette O
transporters O
that O
confer O
resistance O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
structurally O
unrelated O
compounds. O
MRP4 B-Gene
has O
been O
reported O
to O
transport O
antiretroviral B-Chemical
drugs I-Chemical
out O
of O
cells O
in O
an O
active O
process. O
Although O
the O
main O
therapeutic O
effects O
of O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
(NSAIDs) O
are O
their O
ability O
to O
inhibit O
cyclooxygenase O
activity, O
in O
recent O
years, O
some O
pharmacological O
effects O
independent O
of O
this O
action O
have O
been O
described, O
such O
as O
inhibition O
of O
the O
activity O
of O
MRP4. B-Gene
METHODS: O
Detection O
of O
MRP4 B-Gene
expression O
was O
carried O
out O
by O
Western O
blot O
analysis, O
immunofluorescence O
and O
flow O
cytometry O
in O
peripheral O
blood O
lymphocytes O
(PBLs). O
Cells O
were O
infected O
with O
HIV O
type-1(NL4.3) O
isolate, O
and O
treated O
with O
antiretroviral B-Chemical
drugs I-Chemical
plus O
different O
NSAIDs. O
Agp24 O
was O
measured O
by O
ELISA O
3 O
days O
post-infection. O
Intracellular O
[(3)H] B-Chemical
zidovudine B-Chemical
(AZT) B-Chemical
was O
quantified O
by O
a O
scintiller O
counter. O
Expression O
of O
different O
cell O
markers O
was O
assessed O
by O
flow O
cytometry. O
RESULTS: O
NSAIDs, O
as O
well O
as O
probenecid, B-Chemical
were O
able O
to O
potentiate O
the O
antiretroviral O
effect O
of O
several O
nucleoside B-Chemical
reverse I-Chemical
transcriptase I-Chemical
inhibitors I-Chemical
(NRTIs). B-Chemical
PBLs O
expressed O
MRP4 B-Gene
and O
treatment O
with O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
did O
not O
affect O
this O
expression. O
However, O
MRP4 B-Gene
expression O
increased O
following O
phytohaemaglutinin B-Chemical
and O
AZT B-Chemical
treatment. O
This O
decrease O
of O
Agp24 O
was O
correlated O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
intracellular O
AZT B-Chemical
concentration. O
This O
effect O
was O
unrelated O
to O
changes O
on O
expression O
of O
CD4, B-Gene
CXCR4, B-Gene
cell O
viability O
or O
activation. O
Interestingly, O
patients B-Species
treated O
with O
highly O
active O
antiretroviral O
therapy, O
who O
had O
a O
detectable O
viral O
load, O
presented O
a O
higher O
expression O
of O
MRP4 B-Gene
than O
those O
with O
an O
undetectable O
viral O
load. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
NSAIDs O
can O
improve O
the O
antiretroviral O
activity O
of O
NRTIs, B-Chemical
increasing O
their O
intracellular O
concentration O
by O
blocking O
MRP4. B-Gene
This O
finding O
could O
have O
implications O
for O
success O
of O
antiviral O
therapy. O
