# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Cisplatin B-Chemical
accumulation O
is O
decreased O
in O
many O
cisplatin-resistant O
cells. O
An O
active O
efflux O
pump O
for O
cisplatin B-Chemical
exists O
in O
cisplatin-resistant O
human B-Species
epidermoid B-Disease
carcinoma I-Disease
cells O
(called O
KB B-CellLine
cells). O
A O
previous O
study O
has O
suggested O
that O
the O
adenosine B-Chemical
triphosphate I-Chemical
(ATP)-dependent O
glutathione B-Chemical
S-conjugate O
export O
pump O
(GS-X O
pump), O
which O
exports O
the O
bis-(glutathionato)-platinum B-Chemical
(II) I-Chemical
(GS-platinum) B-Chemical
complex, I-Chemical
could O
contribute O
to O
cellular O
resistance O
to O
cisplatin. B-Chemical
PURPOSE: O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
examined O
whether O
the O
active O
efflux O
pump O
for O
cisplatin B-Chemical
in O
the O
cisplatin-resistant O
KB B-CellLine
cells O
is O
the O
GS-X O
pump O
and O
tested O
its O
activity O
by O
using O
an O
endogenous O
substrate, O
[3H]leukotriene B-Chemical
C4 I-Chemical
([3H]LTC4). B-Chemical
METHODS: O
Membrane O
vesicles O
were O
prepared O
from O
KB-3-1 B-Chemical
(clone O
from O
parental O
KB B-CellLine
cells) O
cells O
and O
from O
cisplatin-resistant O
KCP-4 B-CellLine
(a O
mutant O
clone O
derived O
from O
KB-3-1 B-Chemical
cells) O
cells. O
Using O
a O
filtration O
technique, O
we O
measured O
the O
uptake O
and O
transport O
of O
[3H]LTC4, B-Chemical
a O
substrate O
for O
the O
GS-X O
pump, O
into O
membrane O
vesicles O
at O
37 O
degrees O
C. O
RESULTS: O
The O
uptake O
of O
[3H]LTC4 B-Chemical
in O
the O
membrane O
vesicles O
from O
both O
the O
KB-3-1 B-Chemical
and O
KCP-4 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
ATP-dependent. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
ATP-dependent O
transport O
of O
[3H]LTC4 B-Chemical
was O
observed O
only O
in O
KCP-4 B-CellLine
membrane O
vesicles O
but O
not O
in O
KB-3-1 B-Chemical
membrane O
vesicles. O
The O
ATP-dependent O
transport O
was O
vanadate B-Chemical
sensitive O
and O
was O
inhibited O
by O
GS-platinum B-Chemical
complex I-Chemical
but O
only O
marginally O
by O
cisplatin B-Chemical
and O
glutathione B-Chemical
and O
not O
by O
vincristine B-Chemical
or O
verapamil. B-Chemical
The O
nucleotide O
triphosphates, O
guanosine B-Chemical
triphosphate, I-Chemical
cytidine B-Chemical
triphosphate, I-Chemical
uridine B-Chemical
triphosphate, I-Chemical
and O
deoxythymidine B-Chemical
triphosphate I-Chemical
could O
be O
substituted O
for O
ATP B-Chemical
but O
were O
less O
efficient. O
A O
nonhydrolyzable O
ATP B-Chemical
analogue, O
adenosine B-Chemical
5'-(beta,gamma-methylene) I-Chemical
triphosphate, I-Chemical
was O
not O
effective. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
transport O
of O
LTC4 O
in O
membrane O
vesicles O
prepared O
from O
KCP-4 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
facilitated O
by O
an O
ATP-dependent O
pump O
that O
appeared O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
GS-X O
pump. O
IMPLICATIONS: O
Our O
study O
suggests O
that O
the O
GS-X O
pump O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
decreased O
accumulation O
of O
cisplatin B-Chemical
in O
KCP-4 B-CellLine
cells. O
