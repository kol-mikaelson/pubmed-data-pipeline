# Abstract
Sphingosine B-Chemical
1-phosphate I-Chemical
is O
formed O
in O
cells O
in O
response O
to O
diverse O
stimuli, O
including O
growth O
factors, O
cytokines, O
G-protein-coupled B-Gene
receptor I-Gene
agonists, O
antigen, O
etc. O
Its O
production O
is O
catalysed O
by O
sphingosine O
kinase, O
while O
degradation O
is O
either O
via O
cleavage O
to O
produce O
palmitaldehyde B-Chemical
and O
phosphoethanolamine B-Chemical
or O
by O
dephosphorylation. O
In O
this O
review O
we O
discuss O
the O
most O
recent O
advances O
in O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
role O
of O
the O
enzymes O
involved O
in O
metabolism O
of O
this O
lysolipid. B-Chemical
Sphingosine B-Chemical
1-phosphate I-Chemical
can O
also O
bind O
to O
members O
of O
the O
endothelial O
differentiation O
gene O
(EDG) O
G-protein-coupled B-Gene
receptor I-Gene
family O
[namely O
EDG1, B-Gene
EDG3, B-Gene
EDG5 B-Gene
(also O
known O
as O
H218 B-Gene
or O
AGR16), B-Gene
EDG6 B-Gene
and O
EDG8] B-Gene
to O
elicit O
biological O
responses. O
These O
receptors O
are O
coupled O
differentially O
via O
G(i), O
G(q), O
G(12 O
13) O
and O
Rho O
to O
multiple O
effector O
systems, O
including O
adenylate O
cyclase, O
phospholipases O
C O
and O
D, O
extracellular-signal-regulated O
kinase, O
c-Jun O
N-terminal O
kinase, O
p38 B-Gene
mitogen-activated I-Gene
protein I-Gene
kinase I-Gene
and O
non-receptor O
tyrosine O
kinases. O
These O
signalling O
pathways O
are O
linked O
to O
transcription O
factor O
activation, O
cytoskeletal O
proteins, O
adhesion O
molecule O
expression, O
caspase O
activities, O
etc. O
Therefore O
sphingosine B-Chemical
1-phosphate I-Chemical
can O
affect O
diverse O
biological O
responses, O
including O
mitogenesis, O
differentiation, O
migration O
and O
apoptosis, O
via O
receptor-dependent O
mechanisms. O
Additionally, O
sphingosine B-Chemical
1-phosphate I-Chemical
has O
been O
proposed O
to O
play O
an O
intracellular O
role, O
for O
example O
in O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
mobilization, O
activation O
of O
non-receptor O
tyrosine O
kinases, O
inhibition O
of O
caspases, O
etc. O
We O
review O
the O
evidence O
for O
both O
intracellular O
and O
extracellular O
actions, O
and O
extensively O
discuss O
future O
approaches O
that O
will O
ultimately O
resolve O
the O
question O
of O
dual O
action. O
Certainly, O
sphingosine B-Chemical
1-phosphate I-Chemical
will O
prove O
to O
be O
unique O
if O
it O
elicits O
both O
extra- O
and O
intra-cellular O
actions. O
Finally, O
we O
review O
the O
evidence O
that O
implicates O
sphingosine B-Chemical
1-phosphate I-Chemical
in O
pathophysiological O
disease O
states, O
such O
as O
cancer, B-Disease
angiogenesis O
and O
inflammation. B-Disease
Thus O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
the O
development O
of O
new O
therapeutic O
compounds, O
such O
as O
receptor O
antagonists. O
However, O
identification O
of O
the O
most O
suitable O
targets O
for O
drug O
intervention O
requires O
a O
full O
understanding O
of O
the O
signalling O
and O
action O
profile O
of O
this O
lysosphingolipid. B-Chemical
This O
article O
describes O
where O
the O
research O
field O
is O
in O

to O
achieving O
this O
aim. O
