# Abstract
A O
novel O
explanation O
is O
proposed O
for O
the O
metabolic O
differences O
underlying O
two O
distinct O
rat B-Species
urinary O
compositional O
phenotypes O
i.e. O
that O
these O
may O
arise O
from O
differences O
in O
the O
gut O
microbially-mediated O
metabolism O
of O
phenylalanine. B-Chemical
As O
part O
of O
this O
hypothesis, O
it O
is O
further O
suggested O
that O
elements O
of O
the O
mammalian O
gut O
microbiota O
may O
convert O
phenylalanine B-Chemical
to O
cinnamic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
either O
by O
means O
of O
an O
ammonia O
lyase-type O
reaction O
or O
by O
means O
of O
a O
three O
step O
route O
via O
phenylpyruvate B-Chemical
and O
phenyllactate. B-Chemical
The O
wider O
significance O
of O
such O
conversions O
is O
discussed O
with O
similar O
metabolism O
of O
tryptophan B-Chemical
and O
subsequent O
glycine B-Chemical
conjugation O
potentially O
explaining O
the O
origin O
of O
trans-indolylacryloylglycine, B-Chemical
a O
postulated O
marker O
for O
autism. B-Disease
