# Abstract
In O
order O
to O
ascertain O
the O
role O
of O
dietary O
flavonoids B-Chemical
as O
antioxidants O
in O
vivo O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
understand O
the O
chemical O
nature O
of O
the O
absorbed O
forms O
in O
the O
circulation O
in O
vivo O
and O
how O
the O
multiplicity O
of O
research O
findings O
in O
vitro O
reflect O
the O
bioactivity O
of O
flavonoids B-Chemical
in O
vivo. O
Only O
when O
we O
gain O
adequate O
information O
on O
the O
circulating O
forms O
can O
we O
begin O
to O
understand O
the O
targeting O
to O
the O
tissues, O
whether O
flavonoids B-Chemical
cross O
the O
blood-brain O
barrier, O
for O
example, O
and O
in O
what O
forms. O
Flavonoids B-Chemical
are O
powerful O
antioxidants O
in O
vitro, O
but O
their O
overall O
function O
in O
vivo O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
clarified, O
whether O
antioxidant, O
anti-inflammatory, O
enzyme O
inhibitor, O
enzyme O
inducer, O
inhibitor O
of O
cell O
division, O
or O
some O
other O
role. O
It O
should O
also O
be O
emphasised O
that O
the O
reducing O
properties O
of O
flavonoids B-Chemical
might O
contribute O
to O
redox O
regulation O
in O
cells, O
independently O
of O
their O
antioxidant O
properties, O
and O
thus O
might O
protect O
against O
cell O
ageing, O
for O
example, O
by O
working O
together O
with O
the O
intracellular O
reductant O
network. O
To O
gain O
understanding O
of O
these O
issues O
the O
factors O
influencing O
the O
absorption O
of O
flavonoids B-Chemical
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
needs O
to O
be O
established, O
namely O
the O
questions O
of: O
de-glycosylation O
before O
absorption, O
conjugation O
in O
the O
small O
intestine O
through O
glucuronidation, O
sulphation O
or O
methylation O
etc, O
metabolism O
and O
degradation O
in O
the O
colon O
to O
smaller O
phenolic B-Chemical
molecules. O
The O
forms O
in O
which O
they O
circulate O
in O
vivo O
will O
influence O
their O
polarity O
and, O
thus, O
their O
localization O
and O
bioactivities O
in O
vivo. O
Finally O
if O
antioxidant O
activities O
are O
important, O
the O
elucidation O
of O
how O
such O
properties O
in O
vitro O
relate O
to O
the O
potential O
for O
conjugates O
and O
metabolites O
in O
vivo O
to O
act O
as O
antioxidants O
is O
required. O
The O
absorbed O
flavonoid B-Chemical
components O
might O
function O
in O
the O
aqueous O
phase O
(like O
vitamin B-Chemical
C) I-Chemical
or O
in O
the O
lipophilic O
milieu O
(as O
vitamin B-Chemical
E) I-Chemical
in O
vivo. O
This O
will O
depend O
on O
their O
polarity O
properties O
on O
uptake, O
how O
they O
are O
metabolised O
on O
absorption, O
and O
their O
resulting O
structural O
forms O
in O
the O
circulation. O
