# Abstract
Sulfotransferase-2A1 O
catalyzes O
the O
formation O
of O
bile B-Chemical
acid-sulfates I-Chemical
(BA-sulfates). B-Chemical
Sulfation O
of O
BAs B-Chemical
increases O
their O
solubility, O
decreases O
their O
intestinal O
absorption, O
and O
enhances O
their O
fecal O
and O
urinary O
excretion. O
BA-sulfates B-Chemical
are O
also O
less O
toxic O
than O
their O
unsulfated O
counterparts. O
Therefore, O
sulfation O
is O
an O
important O
detoxification O
pathway O
of O
BAs. B-Chemical
Major O
species O

in O
BA B-Chemical
sulfation O
exist. O
In O
humans, B-Species
only O
a O
small O
proportion O
of O
BAs B-Chemical
in O
bile O
and O
serum O
are O
sulfated, O
whereas O
more O
than O
70% O
of O
BAs B-Chemical
in O
urine O
are O
sulfated, O
indicating O
their O
efficient O
elimination O
in O
urine. O
The O
formation O
of O
BA-sulfates B-Chemical
increases O
during O
cholestatic B-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
Therefore, O
sulfation O
may O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
maintaining O
BA B-Chemical
homeostasis O
under O
pathologic O
conditions. O
