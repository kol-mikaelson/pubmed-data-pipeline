# Abstract
We O
studied O
the O
omega-oxidation O
of O
docosanoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(C22:0) B-Chemical
in O
rat B-Species
liver O
microsomes. O
C22:0 B-Chemical
and O
22-hydroxy-docosanoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(omega-hydroxy-C22:0) B-Chemical
were O
used O
as O
substrates, O
and O
the O
reaction O
products O
were O
analyzed O
by O
electrospray O
ionization O
mass O
spectrometry. O
In O
the O
presence O
of O
NADPH, B-Chemical
omega-oxidation O
of O
C22:0 B-Chemical
produced O
not O
only O
the O
hydroxylated O
product, O
omega-hydroxy-C22:0, B-Chemical
but O
also O
the O
dicarboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
of O
C22:0, B-Chemical
docosanedioic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(C22:0-DCA). B-Chemical
When O
rat B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
were O
incubated O
with O
omega-hydroxy-C22:0 B-Chemical
in O
the O
presence O
of O
either O
NAD+ B-Chemical
or O
NADPH, B-Chemical
C22:0-DCA B-Chemical
was O
formed O
readily. O
Formation O
of O
C22:0-DCA B-Chemical
from O
either O
C22:0 B-Chemical
or O
omega-hydroxy-C22:0 B-Chemical
with O
NADPH B-Chemical
as O
cofactor O
was O
inhibited O
strongly O
by O
miconazole B-Chemical
and O
disulfiram, B-Chemical
whereas O
no O
inhibition O
was O
found O
with O
NAD+ B-Chemical
as O
cofactor. O
Furthermore, O
omega-oxidation O
of O
C22:0 B-Chemical
was O
reduced O
significantly O
when O
molecular O
oxygen B-Chemical
was O
depleted. O
The O
high O
sensitivity O
toward O
the O
more O
specific O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
inhibitors O
ketoconazole B-Chemical
and O
17-octadecynoic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
suggests O
that O
hydroxylation O
of O
C22:0 B-Chemical
and O
omega-hydroxy-C22:0 B-Chemical
may O
be O
catalyzed O
by O
one O
or O
more O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
hydroxylases O
belonging O
to O
the O
CYP4A O
and O
or O
CYP4F O
subfamily. O
This O
study O
demonstrates O
that O
C22:0 B-Chemical
is O
a O
substrate O
for O
the O
omega-oxidation O
system O
in O
rat B-Species
liver O
microsomes O
and O
that O
the O
product O
of O
the O
first O
hydroxylation O
step, O
omega-hydroxy-C22:0, B-Chemical
may O
undergo O
further O
oxidation O
via O
two O
distinct O
pathways O
driven O
by O
NAD+ B-Chemical
or O
NADPH. B-Chemical
