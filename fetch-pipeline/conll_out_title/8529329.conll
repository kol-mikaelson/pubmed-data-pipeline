# Abstract
The O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
the O
angiotensin O
II O
receptor O
antagonist O
losartan B-Chemical
potassium I-Chemical
and O
its O
active O
carboxylic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolite O
EXP3174 B-Chemical
were O
characterized O
in O
18 O
healthy O
male O
subjects O
after O
administration O
of O
intravenous O
losartan, B-Chemical
intravenous O
EXP3174, B-Chemical
and O
oral O
losartan. B-Chemical
In O
these O
subjects, O
the O
average O
plasma O
clearance O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
was O
610 O
ml O
min, O
and O
the O
volume O
of O

was O
34 O
L. O
Renal O
clearance O
(70 O

accounted O
for O
12% O
of O
plasma O
clearance. O
Terminal O
half-life O
was O
2.1 O
hours. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
average O
plasma O
clearance O
of O
EXP3174 B-Chemical
was O
47 O

which O
accounted O
for O
55% O
of O

clearance; O
terminal O
half-life O
was O
6.3 O
hours. O
After O
oral O
administration O
of O
losartan, B-Chemical
peak O
concentrations O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
were O
reached O
in O
1 O
hour. O
Peak O
concentrations O
of O
EXP3174 B-Chemical
were O
reached O
in O
3 O

hours. O
The O
area O
under O
the O
plasma O
concentration-time O
curve O
of O
EXP3174 B-Chemical
was O
about O
four O
times O
that O
of O
losartan. B-Chemical
The O
oral O
bioavailability O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
tablets O
was O
33%. O
The O
low O
bioavailability O
was O
mainly O
attributable O
to O
first-pass O
metabolism. O
After O
intravenous O
or O
oral O
administration O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
the O
conversion O
of O
losartan B-Chemical
to O
the O
metabolite O
EXP3174 B-Chemical
was O
14%. O
