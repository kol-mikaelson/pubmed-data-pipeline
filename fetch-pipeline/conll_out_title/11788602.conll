# Abstract
Based O
on O
sequence O
homology O
with O
the O
recently O
cloned O
human B-Species
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase, O
we O
identified O
a O
novel O
beta1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, O
which O
consisted O
of O
532 O
amino O
acids O
with O
a O
type O
II O
transmembrane O
protein O
topology. O
The O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
displayed O
27% O
identity O
to O
that O
of O
human B-Species
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase. O
The O
expression O
of O
a O
soluble O
form O
of O
the O
protein O
in O
COS-1 B-CellLine
cells O
produced O
an O
active O
enzyme, O
which O
transferred O

(GalNAc) B-Chemical
from O
UDP-[(3)H]GalNAc B-Chemical
not O

Hence, O
the O
enzyme O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
biosynthetic O
initiation O
and O
elongation O
of O
chondroitin B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
and O
is O
the O
key O
enzyme O
responsible O
for O
the O
selective O
chain O
assembly O
of O
chondroitin B-Chemical
dermatan I-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
on O
the O

region O
tetrasaccharide B-Chemical
common O
to O
various O
proteoglycans O
containing O
chondroitin B-Chemical
dermatan I-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
or O
heparin B-Chemical
heparan B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
chains. O
The O
coding O
region O
of O
this O
enzyme O
was O
divided O
into O
seven O
discrete O
exons O
and O
localized O
to O
chromosome B-Chromosome
8. I-Chromosome
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
the O
chondroitin B-Chemical
GalNAc B-Chemical
transferase O
gene O
exhibited O
a O
ubiquitous O
but O
markedly O
differential O
expression O
in O
human B-Species
tissues O
and O
that O
the O
expression O
pattern O
was O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
chondroitin B-Chemical
synthase. O
Thus, O
more O
than O
two O
distinct O
enzymes O
forming O
the O
novel O
gene O
family O
are O
required O
for O
chain O
initiation O
and O
elongation O
in O
