# Abstract
Brush O
border O
membranes O
from O
frozen O
human B-Species
small O
intestine O
have O
been O
purified O
using O
a O
method O
which O
did O
not O
involve O
the O
use O
of O
EDTA-containing O
buffers O
or O
the O
disruption O
of O
brush O
border O
fragments O
with O
high O
concentrations O
of O
Tris. B-Chemical
On O
average O
a O
24-fold O
increase O
in O
specific O
activity O
of O
alpha-glucosidase B-Gene
(brush O
border O
marker) O
was O
obtained O
in O
the O
final O
preparation O
which O
contained O
insignificant O
traces O
of O
enzyme O
marker O
activities O
from O
cytosol O
and O
lysosomes. O
The O
homogenates O
of O
human B-Species
small O
intestinal O
mucosa O
were O
shown O
to O
contain O
enzymes O
capable O
of O
hydrolysing O
di-, O
tri-, O
and O
tetrapeptides B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
amino O
acid- O
and O
peptide-2-nephthylamides. B-Chemical
Assuming O
a O
100% O
location O
of O
alpha-glucosidase B-Gene
in O
the O
brush O
border O
membrane, O
distribution O
studies O
indicated O
that O
activities O
against O
tetrapeptides B-Chemical
and O
leucyl-2-naphthylamide B-Chemical
were O
located O
exclusively O
in O
the O
brush O
border O
membrane. O
A O
large O
proportion O
of O
activity O
against O
alpha-glutamyl-2-naphthylamide, O
gamma-glutamyl-2-naphthylamide O
and O
glycyl-prolyl-2-naphthylamide O
were O
also O
recovered O
in O
the O
brush O
border O
membrane O
fraction. O
Depending O
on O
the O
substrate O
utilized, O
33-87% O
of O
tripeptidase O
activity O
was O
located O
in O
the O
brush O
border O
membrane. O
However, O
58-87% O
of O
dipeptidase O
activity O
was O
recovered O
in O
the O
soluble O
fraction. O
