# Abstract
Hypercholesterolaemia B-Disease
is O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
the O
development O
of O
atherosclerotic B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
Atorvastatin B-Chemical
lowers O
plasma O
low-density O
lipoprotein O
(LDL) O
cholesterol O
levels O
by O
inhibition O
of O
HMG-CoA B-Gene
reductase. I-Gene
The O
mean O

relationship O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
log-linear O
for O
atorvastatin, B-Chemical
but O
plasma O

of O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolites O
do O
not O
correlate O
with O
LDL-cholesterol O
reduction O
at O
a O
given O
dose. O
The O
clinical O
dosage O
range O
for O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
is O
10-80 O
mg O
day, O
and O
it O
is O
given O
in O
the O
acid O
form. O
Atorvastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
highly O
soluble O
and O
permeable, O
and O
the O
drug O
is O
completely O
absorbed O
after O
oral O
administration. O
However, O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
subject O
to O
extensive O
first-pass O
metabolism O
in O
the O
gut O
wall O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
liver, O
as O
oral O
bioavailability O
is O
14%. O
The O
volume O
of O
distribution O
of O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
381L, O
and O
plasma O
protein O

exceeds O
98%. O
Atorvastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
extensively O
metabolised O
in O
both O
the O
gut O
and O
liver O
by O
oxidation, O
lactonisation O
and O
glucuronidation, O
and O
the O
metabolites O
are O
eliminated O
by O
biliary O
secretion O
and O
direct O
secretion O
from O
blood O
to O
the O
intestine. O
In O

atorvastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
a O
substrate O
for O
P-glycoprotein, B-Gene
organic B-Gene
anion-transporting I-Gene

and O
the O
half-life O

about O
7 O

The O

In O

cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP) I-Gene
3A4 I-Gene
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
formation O
of O
two O
active O
metabolites O
from O
the O
acid O
and O
the O
lactone B-Chemical
forms O
of O
atorvastatin. B-Chemical
Atorvastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
its O
metabolites O
undergo O
glucuronidation O
mediated O
by O
uridinediphosphoglucuronyltransferases O
1A1 O
and O
1A3. O
Atorvastatin B-Chemical
can O
be O
given O
either O
in O
the O
morning O
or O
in O
the O
evening. O
Food O
decreases O
the O
absorption O
rate O
of O
atorvastatin B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
after O
oral O
administration, O
as O
indicated O
by O
decreased O

Women B-Species
appear O
to O
have O
a O
slightly O
lower O
plasma O

atorvastatin B-Chemical
for O
a O

Atorvastatin B-Chemical
is O
subject O

and O
grapefruit O

An O
interaction O
with O
gemfibrozil B-Chemical
seems O
to O

glucuronidation. O
A O
few O

reported O
rhabdomyolysis B-Disease
when O
the O
pharmacokinetics O

atorvastatin B-Chemical
have O
been O

drugs. O
Atorvastatin B-Chemical
increases O
the O
bioavailability O
of O
digoxin, B-Chemical
most O
probably O
by O
inhibition O

does O
not O
