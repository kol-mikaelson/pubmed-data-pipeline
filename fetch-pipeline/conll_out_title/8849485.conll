# Abstract
The O
undecapeptide O
ciclosporin B-Chemical
is O
used O
as O
immunosuppressant O
after O
organ O
transplantation O
and O
for O
therapy O
of O
immune B-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
Low O
and O
variable O
bioavailability O
of O
ciclosporin B-Chemical
has O
been O
attributed O
to O
its O
metabolism O
in O
the O
small O
intestine. O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
drug O
interactions O
and O
interindividual O
variability O
of O
ciclosporin B-Chemical
metabolism O
in O
the O
small O
intestine. O
Ciclosporin B-Chemical
metabolism O
was O
studied O
in O
vitro O
using O
microsomes O
isolated O
from O
the O
small O
intestine O
of O
humans B-Species
and O
pigs. B-Species
The O
metabolites O
generated O
were O
quantified O
by O
HPLC O
and O
identified O
by O
mass O

Using O
specific O
antibodies O
and O
inhibitors, O
we O
showed O
that, O

In O
the O
