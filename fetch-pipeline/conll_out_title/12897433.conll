# Abstract
Many O
endogenous O
or O
xenobiotic O
lipophilic O
substances O
are O
eliminated O
from O
the O
cells O
by O
the O
sequence O
of O
oxidation, O
conjugation O
to O
an O
anionic O
group O
(glutathione, B-Chemical
glucuronate B-Chemical
or O
sulfate) B-Chemical
and O
transport O
across O
the O
plasma O
membrane O
into O
the O
extracellular O
space. O
The O
latter O
step O
is O
mediated O
by O
integral O
membrane O
glycoproteins O
belonging O
to O
the O
superfamily O
of O
ATP-Binding B-Gene
Cassette I-Gene
(ABC) B-Gene
transporters. O
A O
subfamily, O
referred O
as O
ABCC, O
includes O
the O
famous O
infamous O
cystic B-Gene
fibrosis I-Gene
transmembrane I-Gene
regulator I-Gene
(CFTR), B-Gene
the O
sulfonylurea O
receptors O
(SUR B-Gene
1 I-Gene
and I-Gene
2), I-Gene
and O
the O
multidrug O
resistance-associated O
proteins O
(MRPs). O
The O
name O
of O
the O
MRPs O
refers O
to O
their O
potential O
role O
in O
clinical O
multidrug O
resistance, O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
hinders O
the O
effective O
chemotherapy O
of O
tumors. B-Disease
The O
MRPs O
that O
have O
been O
functionally O
characterized O
so O
far O
share O
the O
property O
of O
ATP-dependent O
export O
pumps O
for O
conjugates O
with O
glutathione B-Chemical
(GSH), B-Chemical
glucuronate B-Chemical
or O
sulfate. B-Chemical
MRP1 B-Gene
and O
MRP2 B-Gene
are O
also O
mediating O
the O
cotransport O
of O
unconjugated O
amphiphilic O
compounds O
together O
with O
free O
GSH. B-Chemical
MRP3 B-Gene
preferentially O
transports O
glucuronides B-Chemical
but O
not O
glutathione B-Chemical
S-conjugates I-Chemical
or O
free O
GSH. B-Chemical
MRP1 B-Gene
and O
MRP2 B-Gene
also O
contribute O
to O
the O
control O
of O
the O
intracellular O
glutathione B-Chemical
disulfide I-Chemical
(GSSG) B-Chemical
level. O
Although O
these O
proteins O
are O
low O
affinity O
GSSG B-Chemical
transporters, O
they O
can O
play O
essential O
role O
in O
response O
to O
oxidative O
stress O
when O
the O
activity O
of O
GSSG B-Chemical
reductase O
becomes O
rate O
limiting. O
The O
human B-Species
MRP4, B-Gene
MRP5 B-Gene
and O
MRP6 B-Gene
have O
only O
partially O
been O
characterized. O
However, O
it O
has O
been O
revealed O
that O
MRP4 B-Gene
can O
function O
as O
an O
efflux O
pump O
for O
cyclic B-Chemical
nucleotides I-Chemical
and O
nucleoside B-Chemical
analogues, O
used O
as O
anti-HIV O
drugs. O
MRP5 B-Gene
also O
transports O
GSH B-Chemical
conjugates, O
nucleoside B-Chemical
analogues, O
and O
possibly O
heavy B-Chemical
metal I-Chemical
complexes. O
Transport O
of O
glutathione B-Chemical
S-conjugates I-Chemical
mediated O
by O
MRP6, B-Gene
the O
mutation O
of O
which O
causes O
pseudoxantoma B-Disease
elasticum, I-Disease
has O
recently O
been O
shown. O
In O
summary, O
numerous O
members O
of O
the O
multidrug O
resistance-associated O
protein O
family O
serve O
as O
export O
pumps O
that O
prevent O
the O
accumulation O
of O
anionic O
conjugates O
and O
GSSG B-Chemical
in O
the O
cytoplasm, O
and O
play, O
therefore, O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
detoxification O
and O
defense O
against O
oxidative O
stress. O
