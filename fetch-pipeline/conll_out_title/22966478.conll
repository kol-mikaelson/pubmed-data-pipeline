# Abstract
The O
molecular O
mechanisms O
involved O
in O
the O
neurodegenerative O
process O
of O
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease I-Disease
remain O
unclear. O
Currently, O
there O
is O
a O
general O
agreement O
that O
mitochondrial B-Disease
dysfunction, I-Disease
alpha-synuclein B-Gene
aggregation, O
oxidative O
stress, O
neuroinflammation, B-Disease
and O
impaired O
protein O
degradation O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
neurodegeneration B-Disease
of O
dopaminergic B-Disease
neurons I-Disease
containing O
neuromelanin B-Chemical
in O
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease. I-Disease
Aminochrome B-Chemical
has O
been O
proposed O
to O
play O
an O
essential O
role O
in O
the O
degeneration O
of O
dopaminergic B-Disease
neurons I-Disease
containing O
neuromelanin B-Chemical
by O
inducing O
mitochondrial B-Disease
dysfunction, I-Disease
oxidative O
stress, O
the O
formation O
of O
neurotoxic B-Disease
alpha-synuclein B-Gene
protofibrils, O
and O
impaired O

Here, O
we O
discuss O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
oxidation O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
to O
aminochrome, B-Chemical
the O
precursor O
of O
neuromelanin, B-Chemical
autophagy O
dysfunction O
in O
dopaminergic B-Disease
neurons I-Disease
containing O
neuromelanin, B-Chemical
and O
the O
role O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
oxidation O
to O
aminochrome B-Chemical
in O
autophagy O
dysfunction O
in O
dopaminergic B-Disease
neurons. I-Disease
Aminochrome B-Chemical
induces O
the O
following: O
(i) O
the O
formation O
of O
alpha-synuclein B-Gene
protofibrils O
that O
inactivate O
chaperone-mediated O
autophagy; O
(ii) O
the O
formation O
of O
adducts O
with O
alpha- B-Gene
and I-Gene
beta-tubulin, I-Gene
which O
induce O
the O
aggregation O
of O
the O
microtubules O
required O
for O
the O
fusion O
of O
autophagy O
vacuoles O
and O
lysosomes. O
