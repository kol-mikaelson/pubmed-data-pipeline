# Abstract
Three O
cytosolic O
and O
one O
plasma O
membrane-bound O
5'-nucleotidases O
have O
been O
cloned O
and O
characterized. O
Their O
various O
substrate O
specificities O
suggest O
widely O
different O
functions O
in O
nucleotide O
metabolism. O
We O
now O
describe O
a O
5'-nucleotidase B-Gene
in O
mitochondria. O
The O
enzyme, O
named O
dNT-2, B-Gene
dephosphorylates O
specifically O
the O
5'- O
and O
2'(3')-phosphates B-Chemical
of O
uracil B-Chemical
and O
thymine B-Chemical
deoxyribonucleotides. I-Chemical
The O
cDNA O
of O
human B-Species
dNT-2 B-Gene
codes O
for O
a O
25.9-kDa O
polypeptide O
with O
a O
typical O
mitochondrial O
leader O
peptide, O
providing O
the O
structural O
basis O
for O
two-step O
processing O
during O
import O
into O
the O
mitochondrial O
matrix. O
The O
deduced O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
is O
52% O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
a O
recently O
described O
cytosolic O
deoxyribonucleotidase B-Chemical
(dNT-1). B-Gene
The O
two O
enzymes O
share O
many O
catalytic O
properties, O
but O
dNT-2 B-Gene
shows O
a O
narrower O
substrate O
specificity. O
Mitochondrial O
localization O
of O
dNT-2 B-Gene
was O
demonstrated O
by O
the O
mitochondrial O
fluorescence O
of O
293 B-CellLine
cells O
expressing O
a O
dNT-2-green O
fluorescent O
protein O
(GFP) O
fusion O
protein. O
293 B-CellLine
cells O
expressing O
fusion O
proteins O
without O
leader O
peptide O
or O
with O
dNT-1 B-Gene
showed O
a O
cytosolic O
fluorescence. O
During O
in O
vitro O
import O
into O
mitochondria, O
the O
preprotein O
lost O
the O
leader O
peptide. O
We O
suggest O
that O
dNT-2 B-Gene
protects O
mitochondrial O
DNA O
replication O
from O
overproduction O
of O
dTTP, B-Chemical
in O
particular O
in O

which O
the O
loss O
of O
thymidine B-Gene

and O

DNA O
replication. O
We O
localized O
the O

dNT-2 B-Gene
on O
chromosome B-Chromosome
17p11.2 I-Chromosome
in O
the O
Smith-Magenis O

that O
dNT-2 B-Gene

the O
