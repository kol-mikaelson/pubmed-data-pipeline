# Abstract
Members O
of O
the O
newly O
discovered O
glycoprotein-associated O
amino O
acid O
transporter O
family O
(gpaAT-family) O
share O
a O
similar O
primary O
structure O
with O
>40% O
identity, O
a O
predicted O
12-transmembrane O
segment O
topology O
and O
the O
requirement O
for O
association O
with O
a O
glycoprotein O
(heavy O
chain) O
for O
functional O
surface O
expression. O
Five O
of O
the O
six O
identified O
gpaATs O
(light O
chains) O
associate O
with O
the O
surface O
antigen O
4F2 B-Gene
heavy O
chain O
(4F2hc B-Gene
= O
CD98), B-Gene
a O
ubiquitous O

protein O
induced O
in O
cell O
proliferation, O
and O
which O
is O
also O
highly O
expressed O
at O
the O
basolateral O
surface O
of O
amino O
acid O
transporting O
epithelia. O
The O
differing O
tissue O
localizations O
of O
the O
4F2hc-associated O
gpaATs O
appear O
to O
complement O
each O
other. O
As O
yet, O
a O
single O
gpaAT O
(b(0,+)AT) O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
associate O
with O
rBAT, B-Gene
a O
4F2hc-related O
glycoprotein O
mainly O
localized O
in O
intestine O
and O
kidney O
luminal O
brush-border O
membranes. O
The O
transport O
characteristics O
of O
gpaATs O
have O
been O
shown, O
by O
expression O
in O
heterologous O
systems, O
to O
correspond O
to O
the O
previously O
described O
transport O
systems O
L, O
y+L, O
xc- O
and O
b(o,+). O
These O
(obligatory) O
exchangers O
of O
broad O
substrate O
specificity O
(with O
the O
exception O
of O
xCT) B-Gene
are O
expected O
to O
equilibrate O
the O
concentrations O
of O
their O
substrate O
amino O
acids O
across O
membranes. O
Thus, O
the O
driving O
force O
provided O
by O
a O
transmembrane O
gradient O
of O
one O
substrate O
amino O
acid, O
such O
as O
that O
generated O
by O
a O
parallel O
functioning O
unidirectional O
transporter, O
can O
be O
used O
by O
a O
gpaAT O
to O
fuel O
the O
secondary O
active O
vectorial O
transport O
of O
other O
exchangeable O
species. O
Vectorial O
transport O
of O
specific O
amino O
acids O
is O
also O
promoted O
by O
the O
intrinsic O
asymmetry O
of O
these O
exchangers. O
The O
fact O
that O
genetic O
defects O
of O
the O
epithelial O
gpaATs O
b(0,+)AT O
and O
y+LAT1 O
cause O
non-type B-Disease
I I-Disease
cystinuria I-Disease
and O
lysinuric O
protein O
intolerance, O
respectively, O
demonstrates O
that O
these O
gpaATs O
perform O
vectorial O
secondary O
and O
or O
tertiary O
active O
transport O
of O
specific O
amino O
acids O
in O
vivo. O
