# Abstract
Lysophosphatidylcholine B-Chemical
(LPC) B-Chemical
is O
a O
major O
plasma O
lipid B-Chemical
that O
has O
been O
recognized O
as O
an O
important O
cell O
signalling O
molecule O
produced O
under O
physiological O
conditions O
by O
the O
action O
of O
phospholipase B-Gene
A(2) I-Gene
on O
phosphatidylcholine. B-Chemical
LPC B-Chemical
transports O
glycerophospholipid B-Chemical
components O
such O
as O
fatty B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
phosphatidylglycerol B-Chemical
and O
choline B-Chemical
between O
tissues. O
LPC B-Chemical
is O
a O
ligand O
for O
specific O
G O
protein-coupled O
signalling O
receptors O
and O
activates O
several O
second O
messengers. O
LPC B-Chemical
is O
also O
a O
major O
phospholipid B-Chemical
component O
of O
oxidized O
low-density O
lipoproteins O
(Ox-LDL) O
and O
is O
implicated O
as O
a O
critical O
factor O
in O
the O
atherogenic B-Disease
activity O
of O
Ox-LDL. O
Hence, O
LPC B-Chemical
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
atherosclerosis B-Disease
and O
acute B-Disease
and I-Disease
chronic I-Disease
inflammation. I-Disease
In O
this O
review O
we O
focus O
in O
some O
detail O
on O
LPC B-Chemical
function, O
biochemical O
pathways, O
sources O
and O
signal-transduction O
system. O
Moreover, O
we O
outline O
the O
detection O
of O
LPC B-Chemical
by O
mass O
spectrometry O
which O
is O
currently O
the O
best O
method O
for O
accurate O
and O
simultaneous O
analysis O
of O
each O
individual O
LPC B-Chemical
species O
and O
reveal O
the O
pathophysiological O
implication O
of O
LPC B-Chemical
which O
makes O
it O
an O
interesting O
