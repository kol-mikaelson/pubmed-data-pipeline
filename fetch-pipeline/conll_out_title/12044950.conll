# Abstract
Cellular O
and O
organismal O
decline O
is, O
in O
part, O
believed O
to O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
oxygen B-Chemical
and O
nitrogen-based O
reactants O
which O
persistently O
damage O
macromolecules O
throughout O
a O
lifetime. O
The O
resulting O
accumulation O
of O
damaged O
molecules O
eventually O
seriously O
compromises O
essential O
functions O
of O
cells O
leading O
to O
their O
death. O
Excessive O
cellular O
loss O
causes O
deterioration O
of O
organ O
function O
and O
inevitably O
to O
the O
demise O
of O
the O
organism. O
The O
sequence O
of O
events, O
known O
as O
the O
free O
radical O
theory O
of O
aging, O
is O
widely O
espoused O
by O
biological O
gerontologists. O
Antioxidants O
are O
commonly O
employed O
to O
combat O
molecular O
damage O
mediated O
by O
oxygen B-Chemical
and O
nitrogen-based O
reactants. O
One O
of O
these O
protective O
agents O
is O
melatonin. B-Chemical
Melatonin B-Chemical
has O
several O
distinct O
advantages O
as O
a O
preserver O
of O
organelle O
structure O
and O
function. O
It O
is O
widely O
distributed O
in O
organisms O
and O
within O
cells. O
It O
works O
via O
a O
number O
of O
mechanisms O
to O
reduce O
oxidative O
damage. O
Thus, O
melatonin B-Chemical
scavenges O
a O
number O
of O
reactants O
including O
the O
hydroxyl B-Chemical
radical I-Chemical
(*OH), O
hydrogen B-Chemical
peroxide I-Chemical
(H(2)O(2)), B-Chemical
nitric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(NO*), O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
(ONOO(-)) B-Chemical
and O
peroxynitrous B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(ONOOH). B-Chemical
One O
of O
the O
products O
of O
melatonin's O
interaction O
with O
H(2)O(2), B-Chemical
i.e., O
N(1)-acetyl-N(2)-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine B-Chemical
(AFMK), B-Chemical
is O
also O
a O
highly O
efficient O
radical O
scavenger. O
The O
cascade O
of O
reactions O
where O
the O
secondary O
metabolites O
are O
also O
effective O
scavenges O
is O
believed O
to O
contribute O
to O
melatonin's O
high O
efficacy O
in O
reducing O
oxidative O
damage. O
Besides O
its O
direct O
scavenging O
actions, O
melatonin B-Chemical
stimulates O
several O
antioxidative O
enzymes O
including O
superoxide O
dismutase, O
glutathione O
peroxidase O
and O
glutathione B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
in O
addition O
to O
inhibiting O
a O
proxidative O
enzyme, O
nitric O
oxide O
synthase. O
This O
combination O
of O
actions O
assists O
melatonin B-Chemical
in O
protecting O
cells O
from O
the O
degenerative O
changes O
normally O
associated O
with O
aging O
and O
age-related B-Disease
