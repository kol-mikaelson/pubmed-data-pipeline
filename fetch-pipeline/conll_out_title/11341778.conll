# Abstract
Phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic B-Chemical
acid) I-Chemical
is O
a O
branched-chain B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
which, O
due O
to O
the O
methyl-group O
at O
the O
3-position, O
can O
not O
undergo O
beta-oxidation O
unless O
the O
terminal O
carboxyl-group O
is O
removed O
by O
alpha-oxidation. O
The O
structure O
of O
the O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
alpha-oxidation O
machinery O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
reactions O
involved, O
has O
been O
resolved O
in O
recent O
years O
and O
includes O
a O
series O
of O
four O
reactions: O
(1) O
activation O
of O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
to O
phytanoyl-CoA, B-Chemical
(2) O
hydroxylation O
of O
phytanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
to O
2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA, B-Chemical
(3) O
cleavage O
of O
2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
to O
pristanal B-Chemical
and O
formyl-CoA, B-Chemical
and O
(4) O
oxidation O
of O
pristanal B-Chemical
to O
pristanic B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
The O
subcellular O
localization O
of O
the O
enzymes O
involved O
has O
remained O
enigmatic, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
phytanoyl-CoA B-Chemical
hydroxylase O
and O
2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA B-Gene
lyase I-Gene
which O
are O
both O
localized O
in O
peroxisomes. O
The O
oxidation O
of O
pristanal B-Chemical
to O
pristanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
has O
been O
claimed O
to O
be O
catalysed O
by O
the O
microsomal O
aldehyde O
dehydrogenase O
FALDH B-Gene
encoded O
by O
the O
ALDH10-gene. O
Making O
use O
of O
mutant O
fibroblasts O
deficient O
in O
FALDH B-Gene
activity, O
we O
show O
that O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
alpha-oxidation O
is O
completely O
normal O
in O
these O
cells. O
Furthermore, O
we O
show O
that O
pristanal B-Chemical
dehydrogenase O
activity O
is O
not O
fully O
deficient O
in O
FALDH-deficient O
cells, O
implying O
the O
existence O
of O
one O
or O
more O
additional O
aldehyde O
dehydrogenases O
reacting O
with O
pristanal. B-Chemical
Using O
subcellular O
localization O
studies, O
we O
now O
show O
that O
peroxisomes O
contain O
pristanal B-Chemical
dehydrogenase O
activity O
which O
leads O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
the O
complete O
phytanic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
alpha-oxidation O
pathway O
is O
localized O
in O
peroxisomes. O
