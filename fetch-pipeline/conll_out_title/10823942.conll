# Abstract
The O
enzymatic O
breakdown O
of O
sphingomyelin B-Chemical
by O
sphingomyelinases O
is O
considered O
the O
major O
source O
of O
the O
second O
messenger O
ceramide. B-Chemical
Studies O

of O
the O
various O

acidic O
and O
neutral O
sphingomyelinases O
to O
the O
signaling O
pool O
of O
ceramide B-Chemical
have O
been O
hampered O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
molecular O
data O
on O
the O
neutral O
sphingomyelinases O
(nSMases). O
We O
recently O
identified O
a O
mammalian B-Species
nSMase, B-Gene
an O
integral O
membrane O
protein O
with O
remote O
similarity O
to O
bacterial O
sphingomyelinases. O
However, O
its O
ubiquitous O
expression O
pattern O
is O
in O
contrast O
to O
previous O
findings O
that O
sphingomyelinase O
activity O
is O
found O
mainly O
in O
brain O
tissues. O
By O
using O
an O
improved O
database O
search O
method, O
combined O
with O
phylogenetic O
analysis, O
we O
identified O
a O
second O
mammalian B-Species
nSMase B-Gene
(nSMase2) B-Gene
with O
predominant O
expression O
in O
the O
brain. O
The O
sphingomyelinase O
activity O
of O
nSMase2 B-Gene
has O
a O
neutral O
pH O
optimum, O
depends O
on O
Mg(2+) B-Chemical
ions, O
and O
is O
activated O
by O
unsaturated B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
phosphatidylserine. B-Chemical
Immunofluorescence O
reveals O
a O
neuron-specific O
punctate O
perinuclear O
staining, O
which O
colocalizes O
with O
a O
Golgi O
marker O
in O
a O
number O
of O
cell O
lines. O
The O
likely O
identity O
of O
nSMase2 B-Gene
with O
cca1, B-Gene
a O
rat B-Species

suggests O
a O
role O
for O
this O
enzyme O
in O
cell O
cycle O
arrest. O
Both O
mammalian B-Species
nSMases O
are O
members O
of O
a O
superfamily O
of O
Mg(2+)-dependent O
phosphohydrolases, O
which O
also O
contains O
nucleases, O
inositol O
phosphatases, O
and O
bacterial O
toxins. O
