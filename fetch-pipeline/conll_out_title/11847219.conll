# Abstract
Prostaglandin B-Chemical
E(2) I-Chemical
(PGE(2)) B-Chemical
production O
involves O
the O
activity O
of O
a O
multistep O
biosynthetic O
pathway. O
The O
terminal O
components O
of O
this O
cascade, O
two O
PGE(2) B-Chemical
synthases O
(PGES), O
have O
very O
recently O
been O
identified O
as O
glutathione-dependent O
proteins. O
cPGES B-Gene
is O
cytoplasmic, O
apparently O
identical O
to O
the O
hsp90 B-Gene
chaperone, O
p23, B-Gene
and O
associates O
functionally O
with O
prostaglandin-endoperoxide B-Gene
H I-Gene
synthase-1 I-Gene
(PGHS-1), B-Gene
the O
constitutive O
cyclooxygenase. O
A O
second O
synthase, O
designated O
mPGES, B-Gene
is O
microsomal O
and O
can O
be O
regulated. O
Here O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
mPGES B-Gene
and O
PGHS-2 B-Gene
are O
expressed O
at O
very O
low O
levels O
in O
untreated O
human B-Species
orbital O
fibroblasts. O
Interleukin B-Gene
(IL)-1beta B-Gene
treatment O
elicits O
high O
levels O
of O
PGHS-2 B-Gene
and O
mPGES B-Gene
expression. O
The O
induction O
of O
both O
enzymes O
occurs O
at O
the O
pretranslational O
level, O
is O
the O
consequence O
of O
enhanced O
gene O
promoter O
activities, O
and O
can O
be O
blocked O
by O
dexamethasone B-Chemical
(10 O
nm). O
SC58125, B-Chemical
a O
PGHS-2-selective O
inhibitor, O
could O
attenuate O
the O
induction O
of O
mPGES, B-Gene
suggesting O
a O
dependence O
of O
this O
enzyme O
on O
PGHS-2 B-Gene
activity. O
IL-1beta B-Gene
treatment O
activates O
p38 B-Gene
and O
ERK O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinases. O
Induction O
of O
both O
mPGES B-Gene
and O
PGHS-2 B-Gene
was O
susceptible O
to O
either O
chemical O
inhibition O
or O
molecular O
interruption O
of O
these O
pathways O
with O
dominant O
negative O
constructs. O
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
the O
induction O
of O
PGHS-2 B-Gene
and O
mPGES B-Gene
by O
IL-1beta B-Gene
underlies O
robust O
PGE(2) B-Chemical
production O
in O
orbital O
fibroblasts. O
