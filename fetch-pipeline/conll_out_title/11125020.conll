# Abstract
It O
is O
established O
that O
agmatine, B-Chemical
an O
endogenously O
formed O
decarboxylated O
arginine, B-Chemical
is O
a O
weak O
competitive O
inhibitor O
of O
neuronal B-Gene
nitric-oxide I-Gene
synthase I-Gene
(nNOS) B-Gene
with O
an O
apparent O

of O

Although O
agmatine B-Chemical
is O
known O
to O
bind O
to O
alpha-adrenergic O
and O
imidazoline O
receptors, O
it O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
some O
of O
the O
pharmacological O
actions O
of O
agmatine, B-Chemical
such O
as O
the O
prevention O
of O
morphine B-Chemical
tolerance, O
may O
be O
due O
to O
the O
inhibition O
of O
nNOS. B-Gene
In O
the O
current O
study, O
we O
have O
discovered O
that O
agmatine, B-Chemical
at O
concentrations O
much O
lower O
than O
the O
reported O
Ki O
value, O
leads O
to O
a O
time-, O
concentration-, O
NADPH-, B-Chemical
and O
calmodulin-dependent O
irreversible O
inactivation O
of O
nNOS. B-Gene
The O
kinetics O
of O
inactivation O
could O
be O
described O
by O
an O
apparent O

constant O
for O
the O
initial O
reversible O

(Ki) O

first-order O
inactivation O
constant O
(k(inact)) O
of O
29 O
microM O
and O

min(-1), O
respectively. O
As O
determined O
by O
high-performance O
liquid O
chromatography O
analysis, O
the O
mechanism O
of O
inactivation O
involves O
alteration O
of O
the O
prosthetic O
heme B-Chemical
moiety O
of O
nNOS, B-Gene
in O
part O
to O
protein-bound O
products. O
Moreover, O
we O
discovered O
that O
agmatine B-Chemical
causes O
a O
3-fold O
increase O
in O
the O
NADPH B-Chemical
oxidase O
activity O
of O
nNOS B-Gene
leading O
to O
the O
production O
of O
H2O2 B-Chemical
and O
is O
a O
likely O
cause O
for O
the O
inactivation O
of O
the O
enzyme. O
Both O
the O
inactivation O
of O
nNOS B-Gene
and O
the O
oxidative O
stress O
produced O
should O
now O
be O
considered O
in O
the O
pharmacological O
actions O
of O
agmatine B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
potential O
biological O
effects O
of O
endogenously O
formed O
agmatine. B-Chemical
