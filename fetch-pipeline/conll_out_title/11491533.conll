# Abstract
The O
mouse B-Species
Vanin-1 B-Gene
molecule O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
thymic O
reconstitution O
following O
damage O
by O
irradiation. O
We O
recently O
demonstrated O
that O
it O
is O
a O
membrane O
pantetheinase B-Gene
(EC O
3.56.1.-). O
This O
molecule O
is O
the O
prototypic O
member O
of O
a O
larger O
Vanin B-Gene
family O
encoded O
by O
at O
least O
two O
mouse B-Species
(Vanin-1 B-Gene
and O
Vanin-3) B-Gene
and O
three O
human B-Species
(VNN1, B-Gene
VNN2, B-Gene
VNN3) B-Gene
orthologous O
genes. O
We O
now O
report O
(1) O
the O
structural O
characterization O
of O
the O
human B-Species
and O
mouse B-Species
Vanin B-Gene
genes O
and O
their O
organization O
in O
clusters O
on O
the O
6q22-24 B-Chromosome
and O
10A2B1 B-Gene
chromosomes, O
respectively; O
(2) O
identification O
of O
the O
human B-Species
VNN3 B-Gene
gene O
and O
the O
demonstration O
that O
the O
mouse B-Species
Vanin-3 B-Gene
molecule O
is O
secreted O
by O
cells, O
and O
(3) O
that O
the O
Vanin B-Gene
genes O
encode O
different O
isoforms O
of O
the O
mammalian O
pantetheinase B-Gene
activity. O
Thus, O
the O
Vanin B-Gene
family O
represents O
a O
novel O
class O
of O
secreted O
or O
membrane-associated O
ectoenzymes. O
We O
discuss O
here O
their O
possible O
role O
in O
processes O
pertaining O
to O
tissue O
repair O
in O
the O
context O
of O
oxidative O
stress. O
