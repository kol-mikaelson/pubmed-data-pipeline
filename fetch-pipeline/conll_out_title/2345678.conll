# Abstract
3-Phenylpropionic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
is O
an O
end-product O
of O
the O
bacterial O
degradation O
of O
unabsorbed O
phenylalanine B-Chemical
in O
the O
intestinal O
lumen. O
As O
CoA B-Chemical
ester, I-Chemical
this O
metabolite O
has O
been O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
specific O
substrate O
for O
medium B-Gene
chain I-Gene
acyl-CoA B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
(MCAD). B-Gene
Its O
glycine-conjugate, O
3-phenylpropionylglycine, B-Chemical
has O
now O
been O
established O
as O
a O
pathognomonic O
marker O
in O
urine O
from O
patients B-Species
affected O
with O
MCAD B-Gene
deficiency. I-Disease
However, O
no O
systematic O
studies O
to O
evaluate O
the O
reactivity O
of O
3-phenylpropionyl-CoA B-Chemical
with O
other O
known O
acyl-CoA B-Gene
dehydrogenases I-Gene
have O
so O
far O
been O
carried O
out O
to O
establish O
the O
specificity O
of O
this O
substrate O
for O
MCAD. B-Gene
We O
studied O
the O
in O
vitro O
reactivity O
of O
3-phenylpropionyl-CoA B-Chemical
with O
five O
rat B-Species
and O
human B-Species
liver O
acyl-CoA B-Gene
dehydrogenases I-Gene
using O
purified O
preparations. O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
MCAD B-Gene
effectively O
dehydrogenated O
3-phenylpropionyl-CoA, B-Chemical
and O
that O
no O
other O
acyl-CoA B-Gene
dehydrogenase I-Gene
exhibited O
any O
significant O
activity O
with O
this O
substrate. O
In O
the O
steady O
state O
condition, O
the O
Km O
of O
3-phenylpropionyl-CoA B-Chemical
for O
human B-Species
MCAD B-Gene
was O

of O
the O
assay O

identified O
trans-cinnamoyl-CoA B-Chemical
as O
the O
product O
of O
the O
reaction. O
Furthermore, O
we O
showed O
by O
determination O
of O
the O
reaction O
products O
using O
gas O
chromatography O
mass O

selected O
ion O
monitoring O
that, O
in O
absence O
of O
the O
primary O
electron O
acceptor, O
3-phenylpropionyl-CoA B-Chemical
was O
slowly O
but O
significantly O
dehydrogenated O
by O
MCAD B-Gene
under O
aerobic O
conditions. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
MCAD B-Gene
may O
oxidize O
3-phenylpropionyl-CoA B-Chemical
in O
vivo O
using O
an O
alternative O
electron O
acceptor, O
to O
produce O
trans-cinnamoyl-CoA. B-Chemical
This O
mechanism O
provides O
an O
explanation O
for O
the O
normal O
3-phenylpropionylglycine B-Chemical

observed O

from O
patients B-Species
