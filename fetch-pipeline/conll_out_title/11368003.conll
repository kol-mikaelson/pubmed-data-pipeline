# Abstract
Leukotriene B-Gene
B4 I-Gene
(LTB4) B-Gene
is O
known O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
potent O
chemoattractants O
and O
activators O
of O
leukocytes O
and O
is O
involved O
in O
inflammatory B-Disease
diseases. I-Disease
Enzymes O
involved O
in O
the O
biosynthesis O
and O
metabolism O
of O
LTB4 B-Gene
have O
been O
cloned, O
and O
their O
properties O
are O
well O
understood. O
Two O
G-protein-coupled O
receptors O
(BLT1 B-Gene
and O
BLT2) B-Gene
have O
been O
cloned O
and O
characterized. O
BLT1 B-Gene
and O
BLT2 B-Gene
are O
high- O
and O
low-affinity O
LTB4 B-Gene
receptors, I-Gene
respectively, O
and O
form O
a O
gene O
cluster O
in O
human B-Species
and O
mouse. B-Species
In O
this O
article O
recent O
findings O
on O
the O
metabolism O
of O
and O
the O
receptors O
for O
LTB4 B-Gene
are O
reviewed. O
We O
also O
discuss O
briefly O
a O
coreceptor O
role O
of O
BLT O
in O
HIV O
infection, O
and O
ion O
