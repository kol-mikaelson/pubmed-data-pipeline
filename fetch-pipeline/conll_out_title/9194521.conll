# Abstract
Sulfation O
is O
the O
transfer O
of O
a O
sulfate B-Chemical
group O
from O
3'-phosphoadenosine B-Chemical
5'-phosphosulfate I-Chemical
(PAPS) B-Chemical
to O
a O
substrate O
that O
is O
catalyzed O
by O
a O
family O
of O
sulfotransferase O
enzymes. O
Many O
different O
endogenous O
and O
xenobiotic O
molecules O
are O
substrates O
for O
the O
sulfotransferases; O
sulfation O
affects O
many O
different O
physiological O
processes, O
including: O
1) O
deactivation O
and O
bioactivation O
of O
xenobiotics, O
2) O
inactivation O
of O
hormones O
and O
catecholamines, B-Chemical
3) O
structure O
and O
function O
of O
macromolecules, O
and O
4) O
elimination O
of O
end O
products O
of O
catabolism. O
PAPS B-Chemical
is O
the O
obligate O
cosubstrate O
that O
is O
synthesized O
in O
tissues O
to O
make O
available O
an O
"activated O
form" O
of O
sulfate B-Chemical
for O
the O
sulfation O
reaction. O
PAPS B-Chemical
participation O
in O
the O
reaction O
is O
dependent O
on O
its O
availability, O
which O
in O
turn O
is O
dependent O
on O
its O
synthesis, O
degradation, O
and O
ultimately O
its O
utilization O
in O
the O
sulfation O
reaction O
itself. O
PAPS B-Chemical
synthesis O
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
availability O
of O
sulfate B-Chemical
and O
on O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
two O
enzymes O
of O
its O
synthesis, O
ATP-sulfurylase O
and O
APS-kinase. O
Although O
the O
kinetic O
properties O
of O
these O
two O
enzymes O
are O
well O
described, O
their O
in O
vivo O
regulation O
is O
not O
fully O
understood. O
Sulfation O
is O
a O
high-affinity, O
low-capacity O
enzymatic O
process O
in O
which O
the O
entire O
liver O
content O
of O
PAPS B-Chemical
can O
be O
consumed O
in O
less O
than O
2 O
min. O
ATP-sulfurylase O
and O
APS-kinase O
can O
rapidly O
synthesize O
additional O
PAPS. B-Chemical
The O
low O
capacity O
of O
sulfation O
in O
rats B-Species
is O
due O
to O
the O
limited O
availability O
of O
sulfate, B-Chemical
whereas O
in O
mice B-Species
the O
sulfotransferases O
appear O
to O
limit O
sulfation O
capacity. O
Sulfation O
rates O
are O
not O
readily O
enhanced, O
but O
they O
can O
be O
decreased. O
2,6-Dichloro-4-nitrophenol B-Chemical
inhibits O
phenolsulfotransferases, O
but O
not O
hydroxysteroid-sulfotransferases. O
However, O
the O
sulfation O
of O
phenols B-Chemical
and O
hydroxysteroids B-Chemical
can O
be O
decreased O
by O
factors O
that O
decrease O
sulfate B-Chemical
availability O
such O
as O
a O
low-sulfate O
diet, O
other O
xenobiotics O
that O
are O
sulfated, O
and O
molybdate, B-Chemical
which O
inhibits O
sulfate B-Chemical
intestinal O
absorption, O
renal O
reabsorption, O
and O
sulfate B-Chemical
incorporation O
into O
