MCCA B-Gene
cDNA O

The O
MCCA B-Gene
gene O

located O
on O
chromosome O
3q26-q28 O
and O
consists O
of O
19 O
exons. O
The O

bp O
MCCB B-Gene
cDNA O
encodes O
the O
non-biotin-containing O

The O
MCCB B-Gene
gene O
is O
located O

and O
consists O
of O

We O
have O
sequenced O
both O

in O
four O
patients B-Species

In O

in O
one O

One O
heterozygous O
mutation O
(S535F) B-ProteinMutation
was O
found O
in O
another O
patient. B-Species
The O
remaining O
two O
patients B-Species
had O
mutations O
in O
the O
MCCB B-Gene
gene. O
One O
consanguineous O
patient B-Species
was O
homozygous O
for O
a O
missense O
mutation O
(R268T). B-ProteinMutation
In O
the O
other O
we O
identified O
a O
missense O
mutation O
in O
one O
allele O
(E99Q) B-ProteinMutation
and O
allelic O

the O
other. O
Mutations O
were O

an O

These O

provide O

that O
human B-Species

caused O
by O

in O
either O
the O
