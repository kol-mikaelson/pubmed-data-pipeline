# Abstract
Cyclosporin B-Chemical
is O
an O
immunosuppressant O
used O
in O
organ O
transplantation O
and O
selected O
autoimmune B-Disease
diseases I-Disease
such O
as O
rheumatoid B-Disease
arthritis. I-Disease
In O
both O
these O
indications, O
the O
elderly O
represent O
an O
important O
and O
growing O
segment O
of O
the O
patient B-Species
population. O
Cyclosporin B-Chemical
is O
primarily O
eliminated O
via O
biotransformation O
by O
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 I-Gene
(CYP)3A B-Gene
in O
the O
gut O
wall O
and O
liver. O
Additionally, O
P-glycoprotein B-Gene
(mdr-1) B-Gene
located O
in O
the O
gastrointestinal O
epithelium O
can O
affect O
affect O
blood O
drug O
concentrations O
after O
oral O
administration O
of O
cyclosporin, B-Chemical
presumably O
by O
counter-transporting O
the O
drug O
from O
the O
systemic O
circulation O
back O
into O
the O
gastrointestinal O
lumen. O
Theoretically, O
age-related O
alterations O
in O
either O
of O
these O
pathways O
could O
affect O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
disposition O
in O
the O
elderly. O
These O
general O
pharmacological O
considerations O
together O
with O
the O
narrow O
therapeutic O
index O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
between O
minimally O
immunosuppressive O
concentrations O
and O
those O
associated O
with O
adverse O
events, O
underscore O
the O
need O
for O
dedicated O
pharmacokinetic O
studies O
in O
the O
elderly. O
Single O
dose O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics O
are O
not O
different O
in O
healthy O
elderly O
individuals O
compared O
with O
healthy O
young O
adults, O
nor O
is O
the O
between-subject O
variability O
in O
pharmacokinetic O
parameters O
more O
heterogenous O
in O
healthy O
elderly O
individuals. O
Similarly, O
there O
were O
no O
apparent O
differences O
in O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
disposition O
in O
elderly O
patients B-Species
with O
rheumatoid B-Disease
arthritis I-Disease
compared O
with O
healthy O
young O
and O
elderly O
individuals. O
Whether O
pharmacokinetic O
variability O
may O
be O
increased O
in O
elderly O
patients B-Species
has O
not O
been O
rigorously O
addressed O
and O
requires O
investigation O
in O
a O
larger O
patient B-Species
population O
for O
a O
definitive O
conclusion. O
A O
population O
pharmacokinetic O
study O
of O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
in O
organ O
transplant O
patients, B-Species
including O
elderly O
allograft O
recipients O
up O
to O
75 O
years O
of O
age, O
did O
not O
identify O
age O
as O
a O
covariable O
influencing O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
pharmacokinetics. O
Hence, O
the O
available O
pharmacokinetic O
data O
in O
the O
elderly O
do O
not O
reveal O
any O
major O
differences O
from O
the O
disposition O
characterised O
in O
younger O
individuals. O
It O
is O
generally O
recognised O
that O
the O
elderly O
are O
more O
prone O
to O
drug-related O
adverse O
experiences O
and O
are O
at O
greater O
risk O
for O
drug-drug O
interactions O
secondary O
to O
polypharmacy. O
The O
former O
factor O
may O
underlie, O
in O
part, O
the O
increased O
incidence O
of O
renal B-Disease
adverse I-Disease
events I-Disease
reported O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
rheumatoid B-Disease
arthritis I-Disease
over O
65 O
years O
of O
age O
receiving O
cyclosporin. B-Chemical
Clinical O
experience O
with O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
in O
elderly O
organ O
transplant O
recipients O
has O
not O
revealed O
a O
tolerability O
profile O
remarkably O
different O
from O
those O
in O
younger O
patients. B-Species
Polypharmacy O
may O
have O
specific O
relevance O
for O
elderly O
patients B-Species
treated O
with O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
since O
this O
agent O
is O
a O
substrate O
of O
both O
CYP3A B-Gene
and O
P-glycoprotein, B-Gene
both O
of O
which O
are O
important O
in O
the O
elimination O
of O
many O
commonly O
used O
drugs. O
This O
implies O
that O
the O
clinician O
prescribing O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
for O
an O
elderly O
patient B-Species
must O
exercise O
a O
heightened O
awareness O
for O
potential O
drug-drug O
interactions O
which O
could O
affect O
the O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
cyclosporin. B-Chemical
Based O
on O
the O
available O
cyclosporin B-Chemical
pharmacokinetic O
data O
in O
adults, O
no O
age-related O
administration O
adaptations O
appear O
necessary O
for O
its O
use O
in O
the O
elderly. O
