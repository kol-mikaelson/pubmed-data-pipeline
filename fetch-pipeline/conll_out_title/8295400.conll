# Abstract
An O
infant O
with O
glycogen B-Disease
storage I-Disease
disease I-Disease
and O
prolonged O
malnourishment B-Disease
showed O
a O
urinary O
organic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
profile O
during O
an O
episode O
of O
fasting O
hypoglycaemia B-Disease
with O
inappropriate O
hypoketotic B-Disease
dicarboxylic I-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
that O
was O
indistinguishable O
from O
that O
reported O
in O
long-chain B-Disease
L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
Although O
there O
was O
a O
striking O
elevation O
of O
urinary O
3-hydroxydecanedioic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
the O
ratios O
between O
hydroxydicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
were O
consistent O
with O
values O
reported O
to O
be O
indicate O
of O
medium-chain B-Disease
acyl-CoA I-Disease
dehydrogenase I-Disease
deficiency. I-Disease
We O
suspect O
that O
the O
fasting O
3-hydroxydicarboxylic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
was O
attributable O
to O
secondarily O
impaired O
enzyme O
activities, O
the O
consequence O
of O
malnutrition, B-Disease
early O
infancy, O
and O
or O

in O
the O
interpretation O
of O
urinary O

patterns O
that O
indicate O
a O
3-hydroxydicarboxylic B-Disease
aciduria, I-Disease
