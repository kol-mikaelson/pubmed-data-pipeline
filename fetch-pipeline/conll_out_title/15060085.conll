# Abstract
Dicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
(DCAs) B-Chemical
are O
omega-oxidation O
products O
of O
monocarboxylic B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
After O
activation O
by O
a O
dicarboxylyl-CoA O
synthetase, O
the O
dicarboxylyl-CoA B-Chemical
esters I-Chemical
are O
shortened O
via O
beta-oxidation. O
Although O
it O
has O
been O
studied O
extensively O
where O
this O
beta-oxidation O
process O
takes O
place, O
the O
intracellular O
site O
of O
DCA B-Chemical
oxidation O
has O
remained O
controversial. O

this O

that O
