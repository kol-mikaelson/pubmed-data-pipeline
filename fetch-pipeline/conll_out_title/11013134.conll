# Abstract
Acyl-CoA O
dehydrogenase O
(ACAD) O
defects O
in O
isoleucine B-Chemical
and O
valine B-Chemical
catabolism O
have O
been O
proposed O
in O
clinically O
diverse O
patients B-Species
with O
an O
abnormal O
pattern O
of O
metabolites O
in O
their O
urine, O
but O
they O
have O
not O
been O
proved O
enzymatically O
or O
genetically, O
and O
it O
is O
unknown O
whether O
one O
or O
two O
ACADs B-Gene
are O
involved. O
We O
investigated O
a O
patient B-Species
with O
isolated O
2-methylbutyrylglycinuria, B-Disease
suggestive O
of O
a O
defect O
in O
isoleucine B-Chemical
catabolism. O
Enzyme O
assay O
of O
the O
patient's B-Species
fibroblasts, O
using O
2-methylbutyryl-CoA B-Chemical
as O
substrate, O
confirmed O
the O
defect. O
Sequence O
analysis O
of O
candidate O
ACADs B-Gene
revealed O
heterozygosity O
for O
the O
common O
short-chain O
ACAD O
A625 O
variant O
allele O
and O
no O

in O
ACAD-8 B-Gene

a O

deletion O
in O
short B-Gene
branched-chain I-Gene
ACAD I-Gene
(SBCAD) B-Gene
cDNA O
from O
the O
patient. B-Species
Our O
identification O
of O
the O
SBCAD B-Gene
gene O
structure O
(11 O
exons; O
>20 O
kb) O
enabled O
analysis O
of O
genomic O
DNA. O
This O
showed O
that O
the O
deletion O
was O
caused O
by O
skipping O
of O
exon O
10, O
because O
of O
homozygosity O
for O
a O
1228G-->A B-DNAMutation
mutation O
in O
the O
patient. B-Species
This O
mutation O
was O
not O
present O
in O
118 O
control O
chromosomes. O
In O
vitro O
transcription O
translation O
experiments O
and O
overexpression O
in O
COS B-CellLine
cells O
confirmed O
the O
disease-causing O
nature O
of O
the O
mutant O
SBCAD B-Gene
protein O
and O
showed O
that O
ACAD-8 B-Gene
is O
an O
isobutyryl-CoA O
dehydrogenase O
and O
that O
both O
wild-type O
proteins O
are O
imported O
into O
mitochondria O
and O
form O
tetramers. O
In O
conclusion, O
we O
report O
the O
first O
mutation O
in O
the O
SBCAD B-Gene
gene, O
show O
that O
it O
results O
in O
an O
isolated O
defect O
in O
isoleucine B-Chemical
catabolism, O
and O
indicate O
that O
ACAD-8 B-Gene
is O
a O
mitochondrial O
enzyme O
that O
functions O
in O
valine B-Chemical
catabolism. O
