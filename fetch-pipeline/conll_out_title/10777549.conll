# Abstract
Computer-based O

identified O
three O

HAOX1, B-Gene
HAOX2, B-Gene
and O
HAOX3, O

plant O
glycolate B-Chemical
oxidase, I-Gene
a O
prototypical O
2-hydroxy O
acid O
oxidase. O
The O
products O
of O
these O
genes O
are O
targeted O
to O
peroxisomes O
and O
have O
2-hydroxy O

activities. O
Each O
gene O
displays O
a O
distinct O
tissue-specific O
pattern O
of O
expression, O
and O
each O
enzyme O
exhibits O
distinct O

HAOX1 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
primarily O
in O
liver O
and O
pancreas O
and O
is O
most O
active O
on O
the O
two-carbon O
substrate, O
glycolate, B-Chemical
but O
is O
also O
active O
on O
2-hydroxy B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
HAOX2 B-Gene
is O
expressed O
predominantly O
in O
liver O
and O
kidney O
and O
displays O
highest O
activity O
toward O
2-hydroxypalmitate. B-Chemical
HAOX3 O
expression O
was O
detected O
only O
in O
pancreas, O
and O
this O
enzyme O
displayed O
a O
preference O
for O
the O
medium O
chain O
substrate O
2-hydroxyoctanoate. B-Chemical
These O
results O
indicate O
that O
all O
three O
human B-Species
2-hydroxy O
acid O
oxidases O
are O
involved O
in O
the O
oxidation O
of O
2-hydroxy B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical

and O
may O
also O
contribute O
