# Abstract
Multicellular O
host O
responses O
to O
infection, B-Disease
injury O
or O
inflammatory B-Disease
stimuli O
lead O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
broad O
range O
of O
chemical O
mediators O
by O
the O
host. O
The O
integrated O
response O
of O
the O
host O
is O
essential O
to O
health O
and O
disease; O
thus O
it O
is O
important O
to O
achieve O
a O
more O
complete O
understanding O
of O
the O
molecular O
and O
cellular O
events O
governing O
the O
formation O
and O
actions O
of O
endogenous O
mediators O
of O
resolution O
that O
appear O
to O

the O

Lipoxins O
are O
trihydroxytetraene-containing O
lipid B-Chemical
mediators O
that O
can O
be O
formed O
during O
cell-cell O
interactions O
and O
are O
predominantly O
counterregulators O
of O
some O
well-known O
mediators O
of O
inflammation. B-Disease
Since O
this O
circuit O
of O
lipoxin B-Chemical
formation O
and O
action O
appears O
to O
be O
of O
physiological O
relevance O
for O
the O
resolution O
of O
inflammation, B-Disease
therapeutic O
modalities O
targeted O
at O
this O
system O
are O
likely O
to O
have O
fewer O
unwanted O
side O
effects O
than O
other O
candidates O
and O
current O
anti-inflammatory O
therapies. O
Here, O
we O
present O
an O
overview O
of O
the O
recent O
knowledge O
about O
the O
biosynthesis O
and O
bioactions O
of O
these O
anti-inflammatory O
lipid B-Chemical
mediators. O
