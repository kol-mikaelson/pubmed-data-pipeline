# Abstract
3-Methylglutaconic B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
(MGTA) B-Disease
comprehends O
a O
group O
of O
disorders O
biochemically O
characterized O
by O
accumulation O
of O
3-methylglutaric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(MGA), B-Chemical
3-methylglutaconic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(MGT) B-Chemical
and O
occasionally O
3-hydroxyisovaleric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(OHIVA). B-Chemical
Although O
neurological B-Disease
symptoms I-Disease
are O
common O
in O
the O
affected O
individuals, O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
brain B-Disease
damage I-Disease
are O
poorly O
known. O
In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
investigated O
the O
in O
vitro O
effect O
MGA, B-Chemical
MGT B-Chemical
and O
OHIVA, B-Chemical
at O
concentrations O
ranging O
from O
0.1 O
to O
5.0mM, O
on O
bioenergetics O
and O
oxidative O
stress O
in O
synaptosomal O
preparations O
isolated O
from O
cerebral O
cortex O
of O
young O
rats. B-Species
MGA B-Chemical
significantly O
reduced O
mitochondrial O
redox O
potential O
(25%), O
as O
determined O
by O
resazurin B-Chemical
reduction, O
and O
inhibited O
the O
activity O
of O
Na(+),K(+)-ATPase O
(30%), O
whereas O
MGT B-Chemical
and O
OHIVA B-Chemical
did O
not O
modify O
these O
parameters. O
Moreover, O
the O
inhibitory O
effect O
elicited O
by O
MGA B-Chemical
on O
Na(+),K(+)-ATPase O
activity O
was O
totally O
prevented O
by O
co-incubation O
with O
the O
scavenging O
antioxidants O
creatine B-Chemical
and O
melatonin, B-Chemical
implying O
a O
role O
for O
reactive B-Chemical
species I-Chemical
in O
this O
effect. O
MGA B-Chemical
also O
increased O
2',7'-dichlorofluorescein B-Chemical
(DCFH) B-Chemical
oxidation O
(30%), O
reinforcing O
that O
this O
organic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
induces O
reactive B-Chemical
species I-Chemical
production. O
The O
present O
data O
indicate O
that O
MGA B-Chemical
compromises O
mitochondrial O
function, O
elicits O
reactive B-Chemical
species I-Chemical
production O
and O
inhibits O
the O
activity O
of O
a O
crucial O
enzyme O
implicated O
in O
neurotransmission. O
It O
is O
therefore O
presumed O
that O
these O
deleterious O
effects O
may O
play O
a O
role O
in O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
the O
brain B-Disease
damage I-Disease
observed O
in O
patients B-Species
affected O
by O
disorders O
in O
which O
MGA B-Chemical
accumulates. O
