# Abstract
BACKGROUND O
AND O
PURPOSE: O
Recently, O
we O
identified O
etodolac B-Chemical
as O
a O
possible O
ligand O
for O
the O
human B-Species
intestinal O
proton-couple O
peptide O
transporter O
(hPEPT1). B-Gene
This O
raised O
the O
possibility O
that O
other O
non-steroidal O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs, O
and O
especially O
ibuprofen, B-Chemical
could O
also O
interact O
with O
hPEPT1. B-Gene
Here, O
we O
have O
assessed O
the O
interactions O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
with O
hPEPT1. B-Gene
EXPERIMENTAL O
APPROACH: O
The O
uptake O
of O
[(14)C]Gly-Sar, B-Chemical
[(3)H]Ibuprofen B-Chemical
and O
other O
radio-labelled O
compounds O
were O
investigated O
in O
Madin-Darby B-CellLine
canine I-CellLine
kidney I-CellLine
cells I-CellLine
(MDCK) B-CellLine
hPEPT1, B-Gene
MDCK B-CellLine
Mock, B-CellLine
LLC-PK(1) B-CellLine
or O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells. O
The O
transepithelial O
transport O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
and O
hPEPT1 B-Gene
substrates O
was O
investigated O
in O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cell O
monolayers. O
KEY O
RESULTS: O
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
concentration O
dependently O
inhibited O
hPEPT1-mediated O
uptake O
of O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
in O
MDCK B-CellLine
hPEPT1 B-Gene

but O
uptake O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
in O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cells O
and O
MDCK B-CellLine
hPEPT1 B-Gene
cells O
was O
not O
inhibited O
by O
hPEPT1 B-Gene
substrates. O
The O
maximum O
uptake O
rate O
for O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
uptake O
was O
reduced O
from O

cm(-2) O
in O
the O

of O
0.5 O
mM O

1 O
mM O
ibuprofen, B-Chemical
respectively. O
The O
interaction O
between O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
and O
hPEPT1 B-Gene
was O
thus O
non-competitive. O
In O
LLC-PK1 B-CellLine
cells, O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
(1 O
mM) O
did O
not O
influence O
the O
transporter-mediated O
uptake O
of O
glycine B-Chemical
or O
alpha-methyl-D-glycopyranoside. B-Chemical
In O
Caco-2 B-CellLine
cell O
monolayers O
the O
absorptive O
transport O
of O
delta-aminolevulinic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
was O
reduced O
by O
23% O
and O
48% O
by O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
(1 O
and O
10 O
mM), O
respectively. O
Likewise O
the O
transport O
of O
Gly-Sar B-Chemical
was O
reduced O
by O
23% O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
ibuprofen B-Chemical
(1 O
mM). O

IMPLICATIONS: O
Ibuprofen B-Chemical
