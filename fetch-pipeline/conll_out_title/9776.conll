# Abstract
The O
kinetics O
of O
14C-glycerol B-Chemical
exchange O
was O
studied O
in O
human B-Species
red O
cells. O
Glycerol B-Chemical
appeared O
to O
be O
transported O
by O
two O
mechanisms: O
(i) O
by O
facilitated O
diffusion O
with O
permeability O
depending O
on O
glycerol B-Chemical
concentration, O
and O
(ii) O
by O
an O
unspecific O
pathway, O
presumably O
representing O
the O
diffusion O
of O
individual O
glycerol B-Chemical
molecules O
through O
the O
membrane O
with O
permeability O
independent O
of O
glycerol B-Chemical
concentration. O
The O
latter O
permeability O
was O
8 O
X O
10(-8) O
cm O
s O
at O
20 O
degrees O
C, O
it O
was O
independent O
of O
pH, O
and O
had O
an O
activation O
energy O
of O
25 O
kcal O
mol. O
The O
facilitated O
transport O
of O
glycerol B-Chemical
was O
completely O
inhibited O
by O
Cu++, B-Chemical
and O
the O
activation O
energy O
was O
low, O
about O
10 O
kcal O
mol. O
The O
transport O
system O
was O
competitively O
inhibited O
by O
H+, O
reacting O
with O
at O
least O
three O
hydrogen B-Chemical
analogue, O
as O
well O
as O
dimethylsulfoxide B-Chemical
(a O
hydrogen B-Chemical
bonding O
molecule O
with O
no O
structural O
resemblance O
to O
glycerol), B-Chemical
inhibited O
glycerol B-Chemical
transport O
competitively. O
Steins O
"dimerizer O
hypothesis" O
was O
revised O
according O
to O
our O
findings. O
A O
kinetic O
scheme O
describing O
the O
reactions O
of O
a O
transport O
controlling O
site O
with O
glycerol B-Chemical
is O
presented O
in O
the O
Appendix. O
It O
is O
demonstrated O
in O
the O
article O
that O
the O
scheme O
accounts O
for O
out O
experimental O
results. O
