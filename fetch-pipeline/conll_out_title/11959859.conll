# Abstract
We O
cloned O
two O
cDNAs O
encoding O
proton O
amino O
acid O
cotransporters, O
designated O
as O
mPAT1 O
and O
mPAT2, O
from O
murine B-Species
tissues. O
They O
were O
identified O
by O
sequence O
similarity O
to O
the O
amino O
acid O
auxin O
permease O
family O
member O
of O
lower O
eukaryotes. O
We O
functionally O
characterized O
both O
transporters O
by O
flux O
studies O
and O
electrophysiology O
after O
expression O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes. O
Both O
mPAT1 O
and O
mPAT2 O
induced O
a O
pH-dependent O
electrogenic O
transport O
activity O

small O
amino O
acids O
(glycine, O
alanine, O
and O
proline) B-Chemical
that O
is O
altered O
by O
membrane O
potential. O
Direct O
evidence O
for O
amino O

H(+)-symport O
was O
shown O
by O
intracellular O

a O

proline B-Chemical
H(+)-symport O
of O
1:1 O

determined O
for O
both O

Besides O
small O

L-amino B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
the O
transporters O
also O
recognize O
their O
D-enantiomers O
and O
selected O
amino O

such O
as O
gamma-aminobutyric B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
The O
mPAT1 O
transporter, O
the O
murine B-Species
orthologue O
of O
the O
recently O
cloned O
rat O
LYAAT-1 O
transporter, O
can O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
low O
affinity O
system O
when O
compared O
with O
mPAT2. O
The O
mRNA O
of O
mPAT1 O
is O
highly O
expressed O
in O
small O
intestine, O
colon, O
kidney, O
and O
brain; O
the O
mPAT2-mRNA O
is O
mainly O
found O
in O
heart O
and O
lung. O
Phenotypically, O
the O
PAT1 O
transporter O
possesses O
the O
same O
functional O
characteristics O
as O
the O
previously O
described O
proton-dependent O
amino O
acid O
transport O
process O
in O
apical O
membranes O
of O
intestinal O
and O
renal O
epithelial O
cells. O
