# Abstract
ABCA1 B-Gene
has O
been O
suggested O
to O
play O
a O
key O
role O
in O
cellular O
lipid B-Chemical
release O
from O
peripheral O
cells. O
In O
order O
to O
study O
structure-function O
relationship O
of O
this O
protein, O
the O
protein O
product O
of O
a O
full-length O
human B-Species
ABCA1 B-Gene
cDNA O
was O
examined O
for O
its O
functions O
and O
topological O
orientation. O
The O
electrophoretic O
mobilities O
of O
human B-Species
ABCA1 B-Gene
expressed O
in O
transfected O
cells O
increased O
when O
treated O
with O
N-glycosidase O
F, O
suggesting O
that O
ABCA1 B-Gene
is O
highly O
glycosylated. O
The O
ABCA1 B-Gene
was O
photoaffinity-labeled O
with O
ATP B-Chemical
and O
mediated O
the O
apoA-I-dependent-release O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
phospholipid. B-Chemical
The O
influenza O
hemagglutinin O
(HA) O
epitope O
was O
introduced O
into O
the O
amino-terminus O
(N-HA) O
or O
between O
the O
residues O
207 O
and O
208 O
(207-HA) O
of O
the O
protein. O
While O
an O
antibody O
against O
the O
C-terminus O
peptide O
of O
ABCA1 B-Gene
detected O
both O
fusion O
proteins, O
an O
anti-HA O
antibody O
did O
not O
react O
with O
the O
N-HA O
fusion O
protein. O
Confocal O
microscopy O
demonstrated O
strong O
cell O
surface O
signal O
with O
the O
anti-HA O
antibody O
of O
nonpermeabilized O
HEK293 B-CellLine
cells O
expressing O
the O
207-HA O
fusion O
protein. O
The O
results O
suggested O
that O
the O
signal O
peptide O
in O
the O
amino-terminal O
region O
is O
cleaved O
off O
in O
its O
mature O
form O
and O
that O
the O
following O
large O
hydrophilic O
region O
is O
exposed O
to O
outside O
of O
cells O
unlike O
previously O
proposed O
models. O
We O
found O
that O
this O
amino-terminal O
extracellular O
domain O
contains O
a O
segment O
homologous O
to O
the O
autoantigen O
SS-N, O
an O
epitope O
of O
Sjogren's B-Disease
syndrome, I-Disease
and O
further O
identified O
that O
ABCA7 B-Gene
codes O
for O
the O
autoantigen O
SS-N. O
