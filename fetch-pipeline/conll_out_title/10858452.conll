# Abstract
LALP70 B-Gene
is O
a O
novel O
lysosomal O
membrane O
protein O
belonging O
to O
the O
apyrase O
protein O
family. O
The O
apyrase O
protein O
family O
comprises O
enzymes O
capable O
of O
cleaving O
nucleotide B-Chemical
tri- I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
diphosphates I-Chemical
in O
a O
calcium- B-Chemical
or O
magnesium-dependent O
manner, O
not O
being O
altered O
by O
P-type, O
F-type, O
or O
V-type O
NTPase O
inhibitors. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
have O
cloned O
and O
sequenced O
the O
human B-Species
LALP70 B-Gene
gene O
to O
determine O
the O
genomic O
structure. O
The O
gene O
is O
organized O
in O
11 O
introns O
and O
12 O
exons O
covering O
a O
genomic O
region O
of O
approximately O
16 O
kilobase O
pairs. O
By O
fluorescence O
in O
situ O
hybridization O
analysis, O
the O
hLALP70 O
gene O
was O
mapped O
to O
the O
human B-Species
chromosome O
8p21.1-p21.3. O
We O
further O
show O
that O
there O
is O
at O
least O
one O
alternatively O
spliced O
variant, O
hLALP70v, O
which O
can O
be O
generated O
via O
an O
alternative O
splice O
side O
at O
the O
3'-end O
of O
exon O
7, O
leading O
to O
a O
protein O
variant O
differing O
in O
8 O
amino O
acids O
(VSFASSQQ). O
This O
is O
the O
first O
splice O
variant O
that O
has O
been O
described O
in O
the O
apyrase O
protein O
family. O
Reverse O
transcriptase O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
analysis O
showed O
an O
ubiquitous O
expression O
of O
both O
variants, O
with O
different O

mRNA O
expression O
levels O
in O
different O
tissues. O
Comparison O
of O
the O
enzymatic O
properties O
of O
the O
splice O
variants O
revealed O
a O
broader O
substrate O
specificity O
for O
hLALP70v O
with O
CTP, B-Chemical
UDP, B-Chemical
CDP, B-Chemical
GTP, B-Chemical
and O
GDP B-Chemical
as O
preferred O
substrates, O
while O
hLALP70 O
utilized O
UTP B-Chemical
and O
TTP O
preferentially. O
Furthermore, O
enzyme O
activity O
of O
hLALP70v O
was O
equally O
dependent O
on O
Ca(2+) B-Chemical
and O
Mg(2+), B-Chemical
being O
saturated O
already O
at O
1 O
mm O
concentration. O
In O
contrast, O
hLALP70 O
enzymatic O
activity O
were O
unsaturated O
up O
to O
10 O
mm O
Ca(2+), B-Chemical
while O
Mg(2+) B-Chemical
showed O
a O
saturation O
at O
already O
1 O
mm O
concentration O
with O
2-3-fold O
lower O
enzymatic O
activity O
as O
observed O
with O
Ca(2+). B-Chemical
Our O
data O

that O
the O

provoke O
differences O
