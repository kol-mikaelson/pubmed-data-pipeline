# Abstract
We O
have O
cloned O
the O
human B-Species
Na(+)- O
and O
H(+)-coupled O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
N O
(hSN1) B-Gene
from O
HepG2 B-CellLine
liver O
cells O
and O
investigated O
its O
functional O
characteristics. O
Human B-Species
SN1 B-Gene
protein O
consists O
of O
504 O
amino O
acids O
and O
shows O
high O
homology O
to O
rat B-Species
SN1 B-Gene
and O
rat B-Species
brain O
glutamine B-Chemical
transporter I-Gene
(GlnT). B-Gene
When O
expressed O
in O
mammalian O
cells, O
the O
transport O
function O
of O
human B-Species
SN1 B-Gene
could O
be O
demonstrated O
with O
glutamine B-Chemical
as O
the O
substrate O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
LiCl B-Chemical
(instead O
of O

and O
cysteine. B-Chemical
The O
transport O
activity O
was O
saturable, O
pH-sensitive, O
and O
specific O
for O
glutamine, B-Chemical
histidine, B-Chemical
asparagine, B-Chemical
and O
alanine. B-Chemical
Analysis O
of O
Li(+) O
activation O

showed O
a O
Li(+):glutamine O

of O
2:1. O
When O
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes, O
the O
transport O
of O
glutamine B-Chemical
or O
asparagine B-Chemical
via O
human B-Species
SN1 B-Gene
was O
associated O
with O
inward O
currents O
under O
voltage-clamped O
conditions. O
The O
transport O
function, O
monitored O
as O
glutamine- B-Chemical
or O
asparagine-induced O
currents, O
was O
saturable, O
Na(+)-dependent, O
Li(+)-tolerant, O
and O
pH-sensitive. O
The O
transport O
cycle O
was O
associated O
with O
the O
involvement O
of O
more O
than O
one O
Na(+) O
ion. O
Uptake O
of O
asparagine B-Chemical
was O
directly O
demonstrable O
in O
these O
oocytes O
by O
using O
radiolabeled O
substrate, O
and O
this O
uptake O
was O
inhibited O
by O
membrane O
depolarization. O
In O
addition, O
simultaneous O
measurement O
of O
asparagine B-Chemical
influx O
and O
charge O
influx O
in O
the O
same O
oocyte O
yielded O
an O
asparagine:charge O
ratio O
of O
1. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
SN1 B-Gene
mediates O
the O
influx O
of O
two O
Na(+) O
and O
one O
amino O
acid O
substrate O
per O
transport O
cycle O
coupled O
to O
the O
efflux O
of O
