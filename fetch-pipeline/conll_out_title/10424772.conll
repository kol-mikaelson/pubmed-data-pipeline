# Abstract
The O
sympathoneural O
neurotransmitter O
norepinephrine B-Chemical
(NE) O
is O
deaminated O
to O
3,4-dihydroxymandelaldehyde B-Chemical
(DHMAL) B-Chemical
and O
subsequently O
converted O
to O
either O
3,4-dihydroxymandelic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(DHMA) B-Chemical
or O
3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol B-Chemical
(DHPG). B-Chemical
In O
this O
study, O
we O
investigated O
the O
relative O
importance O
of O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
versus O
aldehyde B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
in O
the O
formation O
of O
DHPG B-Chemical
from O
DHMAL. B-Chemical
The O
in O
vitro O
incubation O
of O
NE O
with O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
in O
the O
presence O
of O
monoamine B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
(MAO) B-Gene
resulted O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
DHPG, B-Chemical
which O
was O
confirmed O
by O
mass O
spectrometry. O
Although O
aldehyde B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
also O
generated O
DHPG, B-Chemical
its O
activity O
was O
much O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
aldose B-Gene
reductase. I-Gene
With O
northern O
blotting, O
the O
expression O
of O
both O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
and O
aldehyde B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
was O
detected O
in O
rat B-Species
superior O
cervical O
ganglia. O
However, O
with O
western O
blotting, O
only O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
was O
immunologically O
detectable. O
Treatment O
of O
rats B-Species
with O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
inhibitors O
for O
3 O
days O
increased O
the O
plasma O
level O
of O
DHMA. B-Chemical
There O
was O
no O
correlation O
between O
the O
selectivity O
of O
inhibitors O
and O
effects O
on O
NE O
metabolite O
levels. O
A O
significant O
decrease O
in O
DHPG, B-Chemical
however, O
was O
obtained O
only O
with O
an O
extremely O
high O

of O
the O

AL B-Chemical

The O
present O
study O
confirmed O
that O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
generates O
DHPG B-Chemical
from O
NE O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
MAO. B-Gene
In O
rat B-Species
sympathetic O
neurons, O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
appears O
to O
be O
more O
important O
than O
aldehyde B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
for O
the O
formation O
of O
DHPG. B-Chemical
However, O
when O
aldose B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
is O
inhibited, O
it O
appears O
that O
aldehyde B-Gene
reductase I-Gene
can O
compensate O
for O
the O
conversion O
of O
DHMAL B-Chemical
to O
DHPG, B-Chemical
indicating O
redundancy O
in O
the O
reduction O
pathway. O
