# Abstract
Acetaminophen B-Chemical
(APAP), B-Chemical
a O
widely O
used O
analgesic O
and O
antipyretic O
agent, O
can O
cause O
acute B-Disease
hepatic I-Disease

in O
both O
humans B-Species
and O
experimental O

when O
consumed O

large O
doses. O
It O
is O
generally O
accepted O
that O
N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone B-Chemical
imine I-Chemical
(NAPQI) B-Chemical
is O
the O
toxic, O

whose O
formation O

cytochrome B-Gene
P450. B-Gene
Several O

P450 B-Gene
in O
humans, B-Species

been O
shown O

We O
now O
present O
evidence O
which O
demonstrates O
that O
human B-Species
cytochrome B-Gene
P450 B-Gene
2D6 I-Gene
(CYP2D6) B-Gene
is O
also O
involved O

The O
