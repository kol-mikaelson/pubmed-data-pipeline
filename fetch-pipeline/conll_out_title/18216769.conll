# Abstract
Cholesterol B-Chemical
is O
an O
essential O
structural O
component O
in O
the O
cell O
membranes O
of O
most O
vertebrates. O
The O
biophysical O
properties O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
the O
enzymology O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
metabolism O
provide O
the O
basis O
for O
how O
cells O
handle O
cholesterol B-Chemical
and O
exchange O
it O
with O
one O
another. O
A O
tightly O
controlled--but O
only O
partially O
characterized--network O
of O
cellular O
signalling O
and O
lipid B-Chemical
transfer O
systems O
orchestrates O
the O
functional O
compartmentalization O
of O
this O
lipid B-Chemical
within O
and O
between O
organellar O
membranes. O
This O
largely O
dictates O
the O
exchange O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
between O
tissues O
at O
the O
whole O
body O
level. O
Increased O
understanding O
of O
these O
processes O
and O
their O
integration O
at O
the O
organ O
systems O
level O
provides O
fundamental O
insights O
into O
the O
physiology O
of O
cholesterol B-Chemical
trafficking. O
