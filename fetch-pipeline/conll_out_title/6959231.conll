# Abstract
By O

methods O
substantial O
amounts O
of O
the O
C6-C10-dicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
i.e. O
adipic, B-Chemical
suberic I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
sebacic I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
have O
been O
found O
in O
the O
urine O
from O
children O
with O
unexplained O
attacks O
of O
lethargy B-Disease
and O
hypotonia, B-Disease
presumably O
related O
to O
episodes O
of O
fever B-Disease
and O
or O
insufficient O
food O
intake. O
The O
course O
have O
once O
been O
fatal O
and O
is O
often O
characterized O
by O
severe O
hypoglycemia B-Disease
without O
ketonuria. B-Disease
Systematic O

together O
with O

in O

and O
clinical O
data O
from O
4 O
patients B-Species
of O
this O
category, O
have O
shown O
that O
the O
biochemical O
basis O
of O
this O
syndrome O
can O
be O
inborn B-Disease
errors I-Disease
of I-Disease
the I-Disease
beta-oxidation O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
localized O
to O
the O
medium-chain O
acyl-CoA O
dehydrogenation O
system. O
The O
biosynthesis O
of O
adipic, B-Chemical
suberic I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
sebacic I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
was O
studied O
using O
ketotic O
rats B-Species
as O
the O
model, O
since O
ketosis B-Disease
in O
rats B-Species
and O
humans B-Species
is O
accompanied O
by O
excessive O
urinary O
excretion O
of O
adipic B-Chemical
and I-Chemical
suberic I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
A O
probable O
pathway O
for O
the O
production O
of O
the O
three O
dicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
was O
found O
to O
be O
an O
initial O
omega-oxidation O
of O
the O
medium-chain O
C10-C14-monocarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
followed O
by O
beta-oxidation O
of O
the O
resulting O
medium-chain O
dicarboxylic B-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
It O
is O
argued O
that O
the O
source O
of O
the O
omega-oxidizable O
monocarboxylic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
in O
ketosis B-Disease
most O
probably O
is O
the O
fat O
deposites, O
and O
it O
is O
speculated O
that O
the O
patients B-Species
with O
beta-oxidation O
defects O
supplement O
this O
source O
with O
beta-oxidation O
intermediate O
medium-chain B-Chemical
monocarboxylic I-Chemical
acids, I-Chemical
accumulated O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
defect. O
The O
ratio O
between O
the O
excreted O
amounts O
of O
adipic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
sebacic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
in O
the O
urine O
from O
the O
patients B-Species
with O
beta-oxidation O
defects O
is O
less O
than O
50. O
This O
is O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
ratio O
in O
urine O
from O
ketotic O
patients, B-Species
where O
it O
is O
greater O
than O
100. O
Adipic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
sebacic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
ratio-measured O
by O
means O
of O
a O
gas O
chromatographic O
analysis-is O
therefore O
suggested O
as O
a O
tool O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
dicarboxylic B-Disease
acidurias. I-Disease
Based O
on O
the O
clinical O
picture O
and O
the O
pattern O
of O
a O
series O
of O
organic B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
in O
the O
urinary O
metabolic O
profile O
our O
four O
patients B-Species
can O
be O
divided O
in O
two O
types O
of O
dicarboxylic B-Disease
aciduria. I-Disease
The O
two O
types O
have O
different O
therapeutic O
implications. O
