# Abstract
Here O
we O
summarized O
what O
is O
known O
at O
the O
present O
about O
function, O
structure O
and O
effect O
of O
mutations O
in O
the O
human B-Species
prolidase. B-Gene
Among O
the O
peptidases, O
prolidase B-Gene
is O
the O
only O
metalloenzyme O
that O
cleaves O
the O
iminodipeptides B-Chemical
containing O
a O
proline B-Chemical
or O
hydroxyproline B-Chemical
residue O
at O
the O
C-terminal O
end. O
It O
is O
relevant O
in O
the O
latest O
stage O
of O
protein O
catabolism, O
particularly O
of O
those O
molecules O
rich O
in O
imino B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
such O
as O
collagens, O
thus O
being O
involved O
in O
matrix O
remodelling. O
Beside O
its O
intracellular O
functions, O
prolidase B-Gene
has O
an O
antitoxic O
effect O
against O
some O
organophosphorus B-Chemical
molecules, O
can O
be O
used O
in O
dietary O
industry O
as O
bitterness O
reducing O
agent O
and O
recently O
has O
been O
used O
as O
target O
enzyme O
for O
specific O
melanoma B-Disease
prodrug O
activation. O
Recombinant O
human B-Species
prolidase B-Gene
was O
produced O
in O
prokaryotic O
and O
eukaryotic O
hosts O
with O
biochemical O
properties O
similar O
to O
the O
endogenous O
enzyme O
and O
represents O
a O
valid O
tool O
both O
to O
better O
understand O
the O
structure O
and O
biological O
function O
of O
the O
enzyme O
and O
to O
develop O
an O
enzyme O
replacement O
therapy O
for O
the O
prolidase B-Gene
deficiency I-Disease
(PD). B-Disease
Prolidase B-Gene
deficiency I-Disease
is O
a O
rare O
recessive B-Disease
disorder I-Disease
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
prolidase B-Gene
gene O
and O
characterized O
by O
severe O
skin B-Disease
lesions. I-Disease
Single O
amino O
acid O
substitutions, O
exon O
splicing, O
deletions O
and O
a O
duplication O
were O
described O
as O
causative O
for O
the O
disease O
and O
are O
mainly O
located O
at O
highly O
conserved O
amino O
acids O
in O
the O
sequence O
of O
prolidase B-Gene
from O
different O
species. O
The O
pathophysiology O
of O
PD B-Disease
is O
still O
poorly O
understood; O
we O
offer O
here O
a O
review O
of O
the O
molecular O
mechanisms O
so O
far O
hypothesized. O
