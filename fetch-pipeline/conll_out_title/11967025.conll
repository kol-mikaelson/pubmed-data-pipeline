# Abstract
BACKGROUND: O
Indoxyl B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
is O
a O
uremic O
toxin O
that O
accumulates O
in O
the O
body O
because O
of O
the O
patient's O
inability O
to O
excrete O
it O
and O
it O
induces O
a O
number O
of O
uremic B-Disease
symptoms I-Disease
and O
leads O
to O
chronic B-Disease
renal I-Disease
failure. I-Disease
The O
functional O
failure O
of O
the O
excretion O
system O
for O
indoxyl B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
causes O
its O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
to O
characterize O
the O
transport O
mechanism O
responsible O
for O
the O
renal O
excretion O
of O
indoxyl B-Chemical
sulfate. I-Chemical
METHODS: O
The O

investigated O
using O
an O

RESULTS: O
Probenecid B-Chemical
showed O
a O

on O
the O

of O
[3H]indoxyl B-Chemical
sulfate I-Chemical
using O
the O

had O
no O

the O
uptake. O
rOAT3-expressing O

Moreover, O
a O

CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
rOAT3 B-Species
is O
responsible O
for O
the O
renal O
uptake O
of O
indoxyl B-Chemical
sulfate, I-Chemical
