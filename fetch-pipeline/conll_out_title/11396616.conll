# Abstract
Vitamin B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
is O
essential O
for O
many O
enzymatic O
reactions O
and O
also O
acts O
as O
a O
free B-Chemical
radical I-Chemical
scavenger. O
Specific O
non-overlapping O
transport O
proteins O
mediate O
the O
transport O
of O
the O
oxidized O
form O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
C, I-Chemical
dehydroascorbic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
and O
the O
reduced O
form, O
L-ascorbic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
across O
biological O
membranes. O
Dehydroascorbic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
uptake O
is O
via O
the O
facilitated-diffusion O
glucose B-Chemical
transporters, O
GLUT B-Gene
1, I-Gene
3 I-Gene
and I-Gene
4, I-Gene
but O
under O
physiological O
conditions O
these O
transporters O
are O
unlikely O
to O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
the O
uptake O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
C I-Chemical
due O
to O
the O
high O
concentrations O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
that O
will O
effectively O
block O
influx. O
L-ascorbic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
enters O
cells O
via O
Na+-dependent O
systems, O
and O
two O
isoforms O
of O
these O
transporters O
(SVCT1 B-Gene
and O
SVCT2) B-Gene
have O
recently O
been O
cloned O
from O
humans B-Species
and O
rats. B-Species
Transport O
by O
both O
isoforms O
is O
stereospecific, O
with O
a O
pH O
optimum O
of O
approximately O
7.5 O
and O
a O
Na+:ascorbic O
acid O
stoichiometry O
of O
2:1. O
SVCT2 B-Gene
may O
exhibit O
a O
higher O
affinity O
for O
ascorbic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
than O
SVCT1 B-Gene
but O
with O
a O
lower O
maximum O
velocity. O
SVCT1 B-Gene
and O
SVCT2 B-Gene
are O
predicted O
to O
have O
12 O
transmembrane O
domains, O
but O
they O
share O
no O
structural O
homology O
with O
other O
Na+ B-Chemical
co-transporters. I-Chemical
Potential O
sites O
for O
phosphorylation O
by O
protein O
kinase O
C O
exist O
on O
the O
cytoplasmic O
surface O
of O
both O
proteins, O
with O
an O
additional O
protein O
kinase O
A O
site O
in O
SVCT1. B-Gene
The O
two O
isoforms O
also O
differ O
in O
their O
tissue O
distribution: O
SVCT1 B-Gene
is O
present O
in O
epithelial O
tissues, O
whereas O
SVCT2 B-Gene
is O
present O
in O
most O
tissues O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
lung O
and O
skeletal O
muscle. O
