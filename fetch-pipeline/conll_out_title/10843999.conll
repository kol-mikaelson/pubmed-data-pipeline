# Abstract
Through O
suppressive O
subtractive O
hybridization, O
we O
identified O
a O
new O
gene O
whose O
transcription O
is O
induced O
by O
sterol B-Chemical
regulatory O
element-binding O
proteins O
(SREBPs). O
The O
gene O
encodes O
acetyl-CoA B-Chemical
synthetase I-Gene
(ACS), B-Gene
the O
cytosolic O
enzyme O
that O
activates O
acetate B-Chemical
so O
that O
it O
can O
be O
used O
for O
lipid B-Chemical
synthesis O
or O
for O
energy O
generation. O
ACS B-Gene
genes O
were O
isolated O
previously O
from O
yeast, B-Species
but O
not O
from O
animal O
cells. O
Recombinant O
human B-Species
ACS B-Gene
was O
produced O
by O
expressing O
the O
cloned O
cDNA O
transiently O
in O
human B-Species
cells. O
After O
purification O
by O
nickel B-Chemical
chromatography, O
the O
701-amino O
acid O
cytosolic O
enzyme O
was O
shown O
to O
function O
as O
a O
monomer. O
The O
recombinant O
enzyme O
produced O
acetyl-CoA B-Chemical
from O
acetate B-Chemical
in O
a O
reaction O
that O
required O
ATP. B-Chemical
As O
expected O
for O
a O
gene O
controlled O
by O
SREBPs, O
ACS B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
induced O
when O
cultured O
cells O
were O
deprived O
of O
sterols B-Chemical
and O
repressed O
by O
sterol B-Chemical
addition. O
The O
pattern O
of O
regulation O
resembled O
the O
regulation O
of O
enzymes O
of O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthesis. O
ACS B-Gene
mRNA O
was O
also O
elevated O
in O
livers O
of O
transgenic O
mice B-Species
that O
express O
dominant-positive O
versions O
of O
all O
three O
isoforms O
of O
SREBP. O
We O
conclude O
that O
ACS B-Gene
mRNA, O
and O
hence O
the O
ability O
of O
cells O
to O
activate O
acetate, B-Chemical
is O
regulated O
by O
SREBPs O
in O
parallel O
with O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
synthesis O
in O
animal O
cells. O
