# Abstract
Phosphodiesterase B-Gene
11A I-Gene
(PDE11A) B-Gene
is O
a O
recently O
identified O
family O
of O
cAMP B-Chemical
and O
cGMP B-Chemical
hydrolyzing O
enzymes. O
Thus O
far, O
a O
single O
splice O
variant O
designated O
as O
PDE11A1 O
has O
been O
reported. O
In O
this O
study, O
we O
identify O
and O
characterize O
two O
additional O
splice O
variants O
of O
PDE11A, B-Gene
PDE11A2 O
and O
PDE11A3. O
The O
