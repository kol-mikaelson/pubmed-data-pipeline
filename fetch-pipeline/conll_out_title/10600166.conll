# Abstract
Uric B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
has O
been O
considered O
to O
be O
an O
efficient O
scavenger O
of O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
but O
the O
reaction O
between O
urate B-Chemical
and O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
has O
been O
only O
partially O
characterized. O
Also, O
previous O
studies O
have O
indicated O
that O
urate B-Chemical
may O
increase O
peroxynitrite-mediated O
oxidation O
of O
low O
density O
lipoprotein O
(LDL). O
Here, O
we O
examined O
the O
reaction O
between O
urate B-Chemical
and O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
by O
combining O
kinetic, O
oxygen B-Chemical
consumption, O
spin O
trapping, O
and O
product O
identification O
studies; O
in O
parallel, O
we O
tested O
the O
effect O
of O
urate B-Chemical
upon O
peroxynitrite-mediated O
lipid B-Chemical
oxidation. O
Our O
results O
demonstrated O
that O
urate B-Chemical
reacts O
with O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
with O
an O
apparent O
second O
order O
rate O
constant O
of O

s(-1) O
in O
a O
complex O
process, O
which O
is O
accompanied O
by O
oxygen B-Chemical
consumption O
and O
formation O
of O
allantoin, B-Chemical
alloxan, B-Chemical
and O
urate-derived O
radicals. O
The O
main O
radical O
was O
identified O
as O
the O
aminocarbonyl B-Chemical
radical I-Chemical
by O
the O
electrospray O
mass O
spectra O
of O
its O
5, B-Chemical
5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline I-Chemical
N-oxide I-Chemical
adduct. O
Mechanistic O
studies O
suggested O
that O
urate B-Chemical
reacts O
with O
peroxynitrous B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
with O
the O
radicals O
generated O
from O
its O
decomposition O
to O
form O
products O
that O
can O
further O
react O
with O
peroxynitrite B-Chemical
anion. I-Chemical
These O
many O
reactions O
may O
explain O
the O
reported O
efficiency O
of O
urate B-Chemical
in O
inhibiting O
some O
peroxynitrite-mediated O
processes. O
Production O
of O
the O
aminocarbonyl B-Chemical
radical, I-Chemical
however, O
may O
propagate O
oxidative O
reactions. O
We O
demonstrated O
that O
this O
radical O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
species O
responsible O
for O
the O
effects O
of O
urate B-Chemical
in O
amplifying O
peroxynitrite-mediated O
oxidation O
of O
liposomes O
and O
LDL, O
which O
was O
monitored O
by O
the O
formation O
of O
lipid B-Chemical
peroxides B-Chemical
and O
thiobarbituric B-Chemical
acid-reactive I-Chemical
substances. I-Chemical
The O
aminocarbonyl B-Chemical
radical I-Chemical
was O
not O
detectable O
during O
urate B-Chemical
attack O
by O
other O
oxidants O
and O
consequently O
it O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
all O
previously O
described O
prooxidant O
effects O
of O
uric B-Chemical
acid. I-Chemical
