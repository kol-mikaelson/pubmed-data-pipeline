# Abstract
In O
higher O
eukaryotes O
L-lysine B-Chemical
can O
be O
degraded O
via O
two O
distinct O
routes O
including O
the O
saccharopine B-Chemical
pathway O
and O
the O
L-pipecolate B-Chemical
pathway. O
The O
saccharopine B-Chemical
pathway O
is O
the O
primary O
route O
of O
degradation O
of O
lysine B-Chemical
in O
most O
tissues O
except O
the O
brain O
in O
which O
the O
L-pipecolate B-Chemical
pathway O
is O
most O
active. O
L-pipecolate B-Chemical
is O
formed O
from O
L-lysine B-Chemical
via O
two O
enzymatic O
reactions O
and O
then O
undergoes O
dehydrogenation O
to O
Delta(1)-piperideine-6-carboxylate. B-Chemical
At O
least O
in O
humans B-Species
and O
monkeys, O
this O
is O
brought O
about O
by O
the O
enzyme O
L-pipecolate B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
(PIPOX) B-Gene
localized O
in O
peroxisomes. O
In O
literature, O
several O
patients B-Species
have O
been O
described O
with O
hyperpipecolic B-Disease
acidaemia. I-Disease
The O
underlying O
mechanism O
responsible O
for O
the O
impaired O
degradation O
of O
pipecolate B-Chemical
has O
remained O
unclear O
through O
the O
years. O
In O
order O
to O
resolve O
this O
question, O
we O
have O
now O
cloned O
the O
human B-Species
L-pipecolate B-Gene
oxidase I-Gene
cDNA O
which O
codes O
for O
a O
protein O
of O
390 O
amino O
acids O
and O
contains O
an O
ADP-betaalphabeta-binding O
fold O
compatible O
with O
its O
identity O
as O
a O
flavoprotein. O
Furthermore, O
the O
deduced O
protein O
ends O
in O
-KAHL O
at O
its O
carboxy O
terminus O
which O
constitutes O
a O
typical O
Type O

peroxisomal-targeting O
