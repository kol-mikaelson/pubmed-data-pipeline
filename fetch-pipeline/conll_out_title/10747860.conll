# Abstract
We O
report O
here O
on O
the O
cloning O
and O
functional O
characterization O
of O
the O
protein O
responsible O
for O
the O
system O
A O
amino O
acid O
transport O
activity O
that O
is O
known O
to O
be O
expressed O
in O
most O
mammalian O
tissues. O
This O
transporter, O
designated O
ATA2 B-Gene
for O
amino B-Gene
acid I-Gene
transporter I-Gene
A2, I-Gene
was O
cloned O
from O
rat B-Species
skeletal O
muscle. O
It O
is O
distinct O
from O
the O
neuron-specific O
glutamine O
transporter O
(GlnT B-Gene
ATA1). B-Gene
Rat B-Species
ATA2 B-Gene
consists O
of O
504 O
amino O
acids O
and O
bears O
significant O
homology O
to O
GlnT B-Gene
ATA1 B-Gene
and O
system O
N O
(SN1). B-Gene
ATA2-specific O
mRNA O
is O
ubiquitously O
expressed O
in O
rat B-Species
tissues. O
When O
expressed O
in O
mammalian O
cells, O
ATA2 B-Gene
mediates O
Na(+)-dependent O
transport O
of O
alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
a O
specific O
model O
substrate O
for O
system O
A. O
The O
transporter O
is O
specific O
for O
neutral B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids. I-Chemical
It O
is O
pH-sensitive O
and O
Li(+)-intolerant. O
The O
Na(+):amino O
acid O
stoichiometry O
is O
1:1. O
When O
expressed O
in O
Xenopus B-Species
laevis I-Species
oocytes, O
transport O
of O
neutral B-Chemical
amino I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
via O
ATA2 B-Gene
is O
associated O
with O
inward O
currents. O
The O
substrate-induced O
current O
is O
Na(+)-dependent O
and O
pH-sensitive. O
The O
amino O
acid O
transport O
system O
A O
is O
particularly O
known O
for O
its O
adaptive O
and O
hormonal O
regulation, O
and O
therefore O
the O
successful O
cloning O
of O
the O
protein O
responsible O
for O
this O
transport O
activity O
represents O
a O
significant O
step O
toward O
understanding O
the O
function O
and O
expression O
of O
this O
transporter O
in O
various O
physiological O
and O
pathological O
states. O
