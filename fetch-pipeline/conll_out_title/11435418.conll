The O

of O
lecithin:cholesterol B-Gene
acyltransferase I-Gene
(LCAT) B-Gene

We O
present O

for O
the O

this O

rLCAT O

alpha(2)M-MA O

Furthermore, O
rLCAT O

activate O

Reconstituted O

inhibited O
the O

did. O
LCAT B-Gene

alpha(2)M B-Gene

enzymatically O
inactive O

both O

Purified O
rLCAT O

low O

lipoprotein O

however, O

It O

concluded O
that O
the O
binding O
of O
LCAT B-Gene

alpha(2)M B-Gene
inhibits O
its O
enzymatic O
activity. O
Furthermore, O
the O

the O

act O
