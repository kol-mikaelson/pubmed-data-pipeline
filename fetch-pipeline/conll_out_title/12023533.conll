# Abstract
The O
first O
endocannabinoid, B-Chemical
anandamide, B-Chemical
was O
discovered O
in O
1992. O
Since O
then, O
two O
other O
endocannabinoid B-Chemical
agonists O
have O
been O
identified, O
2-arachidonyl B-Chemical
glycerol I-Chemical
and, O
more O
recently, O
noladin B-Chemical
ether. I-Chemical
Here, O
we O
report O
the O
identification O
and O
pharmacological O
characterization O
of O
a O
novel O
endocannabinoid, B-Chemical
virodhamine, B-Chemical
with O
antagonist O
properties O
at O
the O
CB1 O
cannabinoid O
receptor. O
Virodhamine B-Chemical
is O
arachidonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and O
ethanolamine B-Chemical
joined O
by O
an O
ester O
linkage. O
Concentrations O
of O
virodhamine B-Chemical
measured O
by O
liquid O
chromatography O
atmospheric O
pressure O
chemical O
ionization-tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
in O
rat B-Species
brain O
and O
human B-Species
hippocampus O
were O
similar O
to O
anandamide. B-Chemical
In O
peripheral O
tissues O
that O
express O
the O
CB2 O
cannabinoid O
receptor, O
virodhamine B-Chemical
concentrations O
were O
2- O
to O
9-fold O
higher O
than O
anandamide. B-Chemical
In O
contrast O
to O
previously O
described O
endocannabinoids, B-Chemical
virodhamine B-Chemical
was O
a O
partial O
agonist O
with O
in O
vivo O
antagonist O
activity O
at O
the O
CB1 O
receptor. O
However, O
at O
the O
CB2 O
receptor, O
virodhamine B-Chemical
acted O
as O
a O
full O
agonist. O
Transport O
of O
[(14)C]anandamide B-Chemical
by O
RBL-2H3 B-CellLine
cells O
was O
inhibited O
by O
virodhamine. B-Chemical
Virodhamine B-Chemical
produced O
hypothermia B-Disease
in O
the O
mouse B-Species
and O
acted O
as O
an O
antagonist O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
anandamide B-Chemical
both O
in O
vivo O
and O
in O
vitro. O
As O
a O
potential O
endogenous O
antagonist O
at O
the O
CB1 O
receptor, O
virodhamine B-Chemical
adds O
a O
new O
form O
of O
regulation O
to O
the O
endocannabinoid B-Chemical
system. O
