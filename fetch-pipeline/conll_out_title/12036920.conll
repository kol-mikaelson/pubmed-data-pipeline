# Abstract
The O
prodrug O
of O
9-beta-D-arabinosylguanine B-Chemical
(ara-G), B-Chemical
nelarabine, B-Chemical
demonstrated O
efficacy O
against O
T-cell B-Disease
acute I-Disease
lymphoblastic I-Disease
leukemia, B-Disease
and O
its O
effectiveness O
correlated O
with O
the O
accumulation O
of O
the O
triphosphate O
form O
(ara-GTP). B-Chemical
Although O
in O
vitro O
investigations O
using O
purified O
deoxycytidine B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
(dCK) B-Gene
or O
deoxyguanosine B-Gene
kinase I-Gene
(dGK) B-Gene
suggested O
that O
ara-G B-Chemical
is O
a O
substrate O
for O
both O
enzymes, O
controversy O
exists O
in O
regard O
to O
the O
role O
of O
these O
enzymes O
in O
whole O
cells. O
In O
this O
work, O
we O
used O
a O
CEM B-CellLine
mutant O
cell O
line O
containing O
low O
endogenous O
levels O
of O
dGK B-Gene
and O
deficient O
in O
dCK B-Gene
(dCK-) B-Gene
to O
assess O
the O
role O
of O
these O
kinases O
in O
ara-G B-Chemical
phosphorylation. O
Using O
a O
retroviral O
vector O
system, O
we O
infected O
the O
dCK- B-Gene
mutant O
cell O
line O
to O
obtain O
cell O
lines O
with O
overexpression O
of O
dCK B-Gene
(dCK+) B-Gene
or O
dGK B-Gene
(dGK+). B-Gene
Only O
the O
dCK+ B-Gene
cell O
line O
phosphorylated O
1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine B-Chemical
(used O
as O
a O
substrate O
for O
dCK) B-Gene
in O
a O
cell-free O
system; O
phosphorylation O
of O
this O
compound O
by O
dGK+ B-Gene
was O
below O
the O
limit O
of O
detection. O
Again O
in O
in O
vitro O
assays, O
the O
dCK-and O
dCK+ B-Gene
cell O
lines O
phosphorylated O
dGuo B-Chemical
to O
similar O
levels O
(0.91 O

0.15 O
and O
0.93 O

min, O
respectively), O
whereas O
dGK+ B-Gene
phosphorylated O
dGuo B-Chemical
more O
efficiently O
(150 O
pmol O
at O
60 O
min). O
When O
ara-G B-Chemical
was O
used O
as O
a O
substrate O
in O
a O
cell-free O
system, O
the O
maximum O
accumulation O
of O
phosphorylated O
product O
was O
observed O
in O
dGK+ B-Gene
extracts O
at O
low O
ara-G B-Chemical
levels O
(10 O
microM) O
and O
in O
dCK+ B-Gene
extracts O
at O
high O
concentrations O
of O
ara-G B-Chemical
(100 O
microM). O
Thus, O
both O
dCK B-Gene
and O
dGK B-Gene
can O
phosphorylate O
ara-G, B-Chemical
but O
at O
low O
ara-G B-Chemical
concentrations, O
dGK B-Gene
seems O
to O
predominate, O
whereas O
at O
higher O
ara-G B-Chemical
concentrations, O
dCK B-Gene
seems O
to O
be O
the O
preferred O
enzyme. O
In O
whole-cell O
systems O
after O
a O
3-h O
incubation O
with O
10 O
microM O
ara-G, B-Chemical
both O
dCK+ B-Gene
and O
dGK+ B-Gene
cells O
accumulated O
ara-GTP; B-Chemical
however, O
the O
levels O
were O
significantly O
(P O
= O
0.0008) O
higher O
in O
dGK+ B-Gene
cells. O
In O
contrast, O
at O
100 O
microM O
ara-G, B-Chemical
intracellular O
ara-GTP B-Chemical
accumulated O
to O
similar O
levels O

in O

and O

cells. O
These O
results O
from O
whole-cell O
experiments O
are O
consistent O
with O
those O
from O
the O
cell-free O
system O
and O
strongly O
suggest O
that O
ara-G B-Chemical
is O
phosphorylated O
by O
both O
kinases, O
and O
at O
low O
substrate O
concentrations, O
dGK B-Gene
is O
preferred O
enzyme. O
Evaluation O
of O
the O
