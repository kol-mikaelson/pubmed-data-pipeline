# Abstract
Glyoxylate B-Chemical
serves O
as O
intermediate O
in O
various O
metabolic O
pathways, O
although O
high O
concentrations O
of O
this O
metabolite O
are O
toxic O
to O
the O
cell. O
In O
many O
organisms O
glyoxylate B-Chemical
is O
fed O
into O
the O
glyoxylate B-Chemical
cycle. O
Enzymes O
participating O
in O
this O
metabolism O
are O
located O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
membrane. O
The O
permeability O
of O
this O
membrane O
for O
small O
metabolites O
paves O
the O
way O
for O
exchange O
of O
intermediates O
between O
proteins O
catalyzing O
consecutive O
reactions. O
A O
model, O
in O
which O
soluble O
enzymes O
accumulate O
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
both O
ends O
of O
pore-like O
structures O
forming O
a O
transmembrane O
metabolon O
could O
explain O
the O
rapid O
and O
targeted O
exchange O
of O
intermediates. O
The O
metabolites O
passing O
the O
membrane O
differ O
between O
the O
three O
model O
organisms O
Saccharomyces O
cerevisiae, O
Arabidopsis O
thaliana, O
and O
Candida O
albicans, O
which O
reflects O
the O
ease O
of O
evolutionary O
adaptation O
processes O
whenever O
specific O
transporter O
proteins O
are O
not O
involved. O
The O
atypical O
permeability O
properties O
of O
the O
peroxisomal O
membrane O
together O
with O
a O
flexible O
structural O
arrangement O
ensuring O
the O
swift O
and O
selective O
transport O
across O
the O
membrane O
might O
represent O
the O
molecular O
basis O
for O
the O
functional O
versatility O
of O
peroxisomes. O
