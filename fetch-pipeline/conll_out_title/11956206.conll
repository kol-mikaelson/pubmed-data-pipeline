# Abstract
Ceramide-1-phosphate B-Chemical
is O
a O
sphingolipid B-Chemical
metabolite O
that O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
membrane O
fusion O
of O
brain O
synaptic O
vesicles O
and O
neutrophil O
phagolysosome O
formation. O
Ceramide-1-phosphate B-Chemical
can O
be O
produced O
by O
ATP-dependent O
ceramide B-Chemical
kinase I-Gene
activity, O
although O
little O
is O
known O
of O
this O
enzyme O
because O
it O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
highly O
purified O
or O
cloned. O
Based O
on O
sequence O
homology O
to O
sphingosine B-Chemical
kinase O
type O
1, O
we O
have O
now O
cloned O
a O
related O
lipid O
kinase, O
human B-Species
ceramide B-Chemical
kinase I-Gene
(hCERK). B-Gene
hCERK B-Gene
encodes O
a O
protein O
of O
537 O
amino O
acids O
that O
has O
a O
catalytic O
region O
with O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
similarity O
to O
the O
diacylglycerol B-Chemical
kinase O
catalytic O
domain. O
hCERK B-Gene
also O
has O
a O
putative O
N-myristoylation O
site O
on O
its O
NH(2) O
terminus O
followed O
by O
a O
pleckstrin O

This O
activity O
was O
clearly O
distinguished O
from O
those O
of O
bacterial O
or O
human B-Species
diacylglycerol B-Chemical
kinases. O
With O
natural O
ceramide B-Chemical
as O
a O
substrate, O
the O
enzyme O
had O
a O
pH O
optimum O
of O
6.0-7.5 O
and O
showed O
Michaelis-Menten O
kinetics, O
with O
K(m) O
values O
of O
187 O
and O
32 O
microm O
for O
ceramide B-Chemical
and O
ATP, B-Gene
respectively. O
Northern O
blot O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
hCERK B-Gene
mRNA O
expression O
was O
high O
in O
the O
brain, O
heart, O
skeletal O
muscle, O
kidney, O
and O
liver. O
A O
BLAST O
search O
analysis O
using O
the O
hCERK B-Gene
sequence O
revealed O
that O
putative O
ceramide B-Chemical
kinases O
(CERKs) O
exist O
widely O
in O
diverse O
multicellular O
organisms O
including O
plants, O
nematodes, O
insects, O
and O
vertebrates. O
Phylogenetic O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
CERKs O
are O
a O
new O
class O
of O
lipid O
kinases O
that O
are O
clearly O
distinct O
from O
sphingosine B-Chemical
and O
diacylglycerol B-Chemical
kinases. O
Cloning O
of O
CERK B-Gene
should O
provide O
new O
molecular O
tools O
to O
investigate O
the O
physiological O
functions O
of O
ceramide-1-phosphate. B-Chemical
