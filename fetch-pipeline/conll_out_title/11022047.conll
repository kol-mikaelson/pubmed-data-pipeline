# Abstract
Three O
families O
of O
phospholipase O
C O
(PI-PLCbeta, O
gamma, O
and O
delta) O
are O
known O
to O
catalyze O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
polyphosphoinositides B-Chemical
such O
as O
phosphatidylinositol B-Chemical
4,5-bisphosphate I-Chemical
(PIP(2)) B-Chemical
to O
generate O
the O
second O
messengers O
inositol B-Chemical
1,4,5 I-Chemical
trisphosphate I-Chemical
and O
diacylglycerol, B-Chemical
leading O
to O
a O
cascade O
of O
intracellular O
responses O
that O
result O
in O
cell O
growth, O
cell O
differentiation, O
and O
gene O
expression. O
Here O
we O
describe O
the O
founding O
member O
of O
a O
novel, O
structurally O
distinct O
fourth O
family O
of O
PI-PLC. O
PLCepsilon O
not O
only O
contains O
conserved O
catalytic O
(X O
and O
Y) O
and O
regulatory O
domains O
(C2) O
common O
to O
other O
eukaryotic O
PLCs, O
but O
also O
contains O
two O
Ras-associating O
(RA) O
domains O
and O
a O
Ras O
guanine O
nucleotide O
exchange O
factor O
(RasGEF) O
motif. O
PLCepsilon O
hydrolyzes O
PIP(2), B-Chemical
and O
this O
activity O
is O
stimulated O
selectively O
by O
a O
constitutively O
active O
form O
of O
the O
heterotrimeric O
G O
protein O
Galpha(12). B-Gene
PLCepsilon O
and O
a O
mutant O
(H1144L) B-ProteinMutation
incapable O
of O
hydrolyzing O
phosphoinositides B-Chemical
promote O
formation O
of O
GTP-Ras. O
Thus O
PLCepsilon O
is O
a O
RasGEF. O
PLCepsilon, O
the O
mutant O
H1144L, B-ProteinMutation
and O
the O
isolated O
GEF B-Gene
domain O
activate O
the O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
pathway O
in O
a O
manner O
dependent O
on O
Ras O
but O
independent O
of O
PIP(2) B-Chemical
hydrolysis. O
Our O
findings O
demonstrate O
that O
PLCepsilon O
is O
a O
novel O
bifunctional O
enzyme O
that O
is O
regulated O
by O
the O
heterotrimeric O
G O
protein O
Galpha(12) B-Gene
and O
activates O
the O
small O
G O
protein O
Ras O
mitogen-activated O
protein O
kinase O
signaling O
pathway. O
