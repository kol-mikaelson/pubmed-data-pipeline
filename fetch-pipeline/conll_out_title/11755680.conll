# Abstract
Acyl-CoA B-Chemical
thioesterases I-Chemical
are O
a O
group O
of O
enzymes O
that O
catalyze O
the O
hydrolysis O
of O
acyl-CoAs B-Chemical
to O
the O
free B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
and I-Chemical
coenzyme I-Chemical
A I-Chemical
(CoASH), B-Chemical
providing O
the O
potential O
to O
regulate O
intracellular O
levels O
of O
acyl-CoAs, B-Chemical
free B-Chemical
fatty I-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
and O
CoASH. B-Chemical
These O
enzymes O
are O
localized O
in O
almost O
all O
cellular O
compartments O
such O
as O
endoplasmic O
reticulum, O
cytosol, O
mitochondria O
and O
peroxisomes. O
Acyl-CoA B-Chemical
thioesterases I-Chemical
are O
highly O
regulated O
by O
peroxisome O
proliferator-activated O
receptors O
(PPARs), O
and O
other O
nutritional O
factors, O
which O
has O
led O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
they O
are O
involved O
in O
lipid B-Chemical
metabolism. O
Although O
the O
physiological O
functions O
for O
these O
enzymes O
are O
not O
yet O
fully O
understood, O
recent O
cloning O
and O
more O
in-depth O
characterization O
of O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
thioesterases I-Chemical
has O
assisted O
in O
discussion O
of O
putative O
functions O
for O
specific O
enzymes. O
Here O
we O
review O
the O
acyl-CoA B-Chemical
thioesterases I-Chemical
characterized O
to O
date O
and O
also O
address O
the O
diverse O
putative O
functions O
for O
these O
enzymes, O
such O
as O
in O
ligand O
supply O
for O
nuclear O
receptors, O
and O
regulation O
and O
termination O
of O
fatty O
acid O
oxidation O
in O
mitochondria O
and O
peroxisomes. O
