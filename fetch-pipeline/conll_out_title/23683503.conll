# Abstract
: O
Parkinson's B-Disease
disease I-Disease
(PD) B-Disease
coincides O
with O
a O
dramatic O
loss O
of O
dopaminergic O
neurons O
within O
the O
substantia O
nigra. O
A O
key O
player O
in O
the O
loss O
of O
dopaminergic O
neurons O
is O
oxidative O
stress. O
Dopamine B-Chemical
(DA) B-Chemical
metabolism O
itself O
is O
strongly O
linked O
to O
oxidative O
stress O
as O
its O
degradation O
generates O
reactive B-Chemical
oxygen I-Chemical
species I-Chemical
(ROS) B-Chemical
and O
DA B-Chemical
oxidation O
can O
lead O
to O
endogenous O
neurotoxins O
whereas O
some O
DA B-Chemical
derivatives O
show O
antioxidative O
effects. O
Therefore, O
DA B-Chemical
metabolism O
is O
of O
special O
importance O
for O
neuronal O
redox-homeostasis O
and O
viability.In O
this O
review O
we O
highlight O
different O
aspects O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
metabolism O
in O
the O
context O
of O
PD B-Disease
and O
neurodegeneration. B-Disease
Since O
most O
reviews O
focus O
only O
on O
single O
aspects O
of O
the O
DA B-Chemical
system, O
we O
will O
give O
a O
broader O
overview O
by O
looking O
at O
DA B-Chemical
biosynthesis, O
sequestration, O
degradation O
and O
oxidation O
chemistry O
at O
the O
metabolic O
level, O
as O
well O
as O
at O
the O
transcriptional, O
translational O
and O
posttranslational O
regulation O
of O
all O
enzymes O
involved. O
This O
is O
followed O
by O
a O
short O
overview O
of O
cellular O
models O
currently O
used O
in O
PD B-Disease
research. O
Finally, O
we O
will O
address O
the O
topic O
from O
a O
medical O
point O
of O
view O
which O
directly O
aims O
to O
encounter O
PD. B-Disease
