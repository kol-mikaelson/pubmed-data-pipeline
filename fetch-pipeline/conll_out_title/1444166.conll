# Abstract
We O
have O
analysed O
organic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
profiles O
in O
74 O
samples O
of O
post-mortem O
vitreous O
humour O
from O
the O
sudden B-Disease
infant I-Disease
death I-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
and O
compared O
the O
profiles O
to O
those O
obtained O
from O
the O
corresponding O
urine O
or O
bladder O
wall O
swab. O
There O
was O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
correlation O
indicating O
that O
vitreous O
humour O
analysis O
in O
high-risk O
infants O
is O
an O
appropriate O
analytical O
strategy O
when O
urine O
is O
not O
available. O
In O
our O
patient B-Species
sample O
two O
infants O
had O
evidence O
of O
abnormal O
methylmalonic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
metabolism, O
one O
had O
glyceric B-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
(and O
elevated O
levels O
of O
vitreous O
humour O
glyceric B-Chemical
acid), I-Chemical
one O
had O
evidence O
of O
pre-existing O
liver B-Disease
damage I-Disease
as O
judged O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
4-hydroxyphenyllactic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
one O
had O
a O
non-ketotic B-Disease
dicarboxylic I-Disease
aciduria I-Disease
indicating O
inhibited O
fatty B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
oxidation O
and O
two O
patients B-Species
had O
significant O
long-chain B-Chemical
3-hydroxydicarboxylic I-Chemical

evidence O
of O
paracetamol O
