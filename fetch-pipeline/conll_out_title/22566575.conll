# Abstract
Lecithin:cholesterol B-Gene
acyltransferase I-Gene
(LCAT) B-Gene
is O
a O
key O
enzyme O
that O
catalyzes O
the O
esterification O
of O
free O
cholesterol B-Chemical
in O
plasma O
lipoproteins O
and O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
high-density O
lipoprotein O
(HDL) O
metabolism. O
Deficiency O
leads O
to O
accumulation O
of O
nascent O
prebeta-HDL O
due O
to O
impaired O
maturation O
of O
HDL O
particles, O
whereas O
enhanced O
expression O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
formation O
of O
large, O
apoE-rich O
HDL(1) O
particles. O
In O
addition O
to O
its O
function O
in O
HDL O
metabolism, O
LCAT B-Gene
was O
believed O
to O
be O
an O
important O
driving O
force O
behind O
macrophage O
reverse O
cholesterol B-Chemical
transport O
(RCT) O
and, O
therefore, O
has O
been O
a O
subject O
of O
great O
interest O
in O
cardiovascular O
research O
since O
its O
discovery O
in O
1962. O
Although O
half O
a O
century O
has O
passed, O
the O
importance O
of O
LCAT B-Gene
for O
atheroprotection O
is O
still O
under O
intense O
debate. O
This O
review O
provides O
a O
comprehensive O
overview O
of O
the O
insights O
that O
have O
been O
gained O
in O
the O
past O
50 O
years O
on O
the O
biochemistry O
of O
LCAT, B-Gene
the O
role O
of O
LCAT B-Gene
in O
lipoprotein O
metabolism O
and O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
atherosclerosis B-Disease
in O
animal O
models, O
and O
its O
impact O
on O
