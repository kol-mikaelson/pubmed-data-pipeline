# Abstract
Mammalian O
L-isomer O
dehydrogenases O
represent O
an O
expansive O
and O
well O
characterized O
class O
of O
metabolic O
enzymes. O
Surprisingly, O
little O
is O
known O
regarding O
their O
evolutionarily O
distinct O
counterparts, O
D-isomer O
dehydrogenases, O
since O
few O
mammalian O
D-isomer B-Chemical
2-hydroxy I-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
enzymes O
have O
been O
isolated. O
Here O
we O
present O
the O
identification O
and O
initial O

of O

that O
