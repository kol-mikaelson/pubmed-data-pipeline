# Abstract
Allopurinol B-Chemical
is O
the O
drug O
most O
widely O
used O
to O
lower O
the O
blood O
concentrations O
of O
urate B-Chemical
and, O
therefore, O
to O
decrease O
the O
number O
of O
repeated O
attacks O
of O
gout. B-Disease
Allopurinol B-Chemical
is O
rapidly O
and O
extensively O
metabolised O
to O
oxypurinol B-Chemical
(oxipurinol), B-Chemical
and O
the O
hypouricaemic B-Disease
efficacy O
of O
allopurinol B-Chemical
is O
due O
very O
largely O
to O
this O
metabolite. O

Oxypurinol B-Chemical
is O
cleared O
almost O
entirely O
by O
urinary O
excretion O
and, O
for O
many O
years, O
it O
has O
been O
recommended O
that O
the O
dosage O
of O
allopurinol B-Chemical
should O
be O
reduced O
in O
renal B-Disease
impairment. I-Disease
A O
reduced O
initial O
target O
dosage O
in O
renal B-Disease
impairment I-Disease
is O
still O
reasonable, O
but O
recent O
data O
on O
the O
toxicity B-Disease
of O
allopurinol B-Chemical
indicate O
that O
the O
dosage O
may O
be O
increased O
above O
the O
present O
guidelines O
if O
the O
reduction O
in O
plasma O
urate B-Chemical
concentrations O
is O
inadequate. O
Measurement O
of O
plasma O
concentrations O
of O
oxypurinol B-Chemical
in O
selected O
patients, B-Species
particularly O
those O
with O
renal B-Disease
impairment, I-Disease
may O
help O
to O
decrease O
the O
risk O
of O
toxicity B-Disease
and O
improve O
the O
hypouricaemic B-Disease
response. O
Monitoring O
of O
plasma O
concentrations O
of O
oxypurinol B-Chemical
should O
also O
help O
to O
identify O
patients B-Species
with O
poor O
adherence. O
Uricosuric B-Chemical
drugs, I-Chemical
such O
as O
probenecid, B-Chemical
have O
potentially O
opposing O
effects O
on O
the O
hypouricaemic B-Disease
efficacy O
of O
allopurinol. B-Chemical
Their O
uricosuric O
effect O
lowers O
the O
plasma O
concentrations O
of O
urate; B-Chemical
however, O
they O
increase O
the O
CL(R) O
of O
oxypurinol, B-Chemical
thus O
potentially O
decreasing O
the O
influence O
of O
allopurinol. B-Chemical
The O
net O
effect O
is O
an O
increased O
degree O
of O
hypouricaemia, B-Disease
but O
the O
interaction O
is O
probably O
limited O
to O
patients B-Species
with O
normal O
renal O
function O
or O
only O
moderate O
impairment. O
