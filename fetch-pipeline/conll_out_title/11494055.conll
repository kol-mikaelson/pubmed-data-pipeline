# Abstract
Uridine B-Chemical
cytidine B-Chemical
kinase O
which O
converts O
uridine B-Chemical
and O
cytidine B-Chemical
to O
their O
corresponding O
monophosphates O
is O
a O
rate-limiting O
enzyme O
involved O
in O
the O
salvage O
pathway O
of O
pyrimidine B-Chemical
synthesis. O
We O
isolated O
cDNA O
encoding O
the O
enzyme O
from O
human B-Species
fibrosarcoma B-Disease
cells, O
then O
determined O
its O
nucleotide O
sequence O
by O
the O
5'-RACE O
method O
followed O
by O
confirmation O
employing O
the O
human B-Species
genome O
DNA O
library. O
The O
isolated O
uridine B-Chemical
cytidine B-Chemical
kinase O
cDNA O
(UCK O
cDNA) O
consisted O
of O
786 O
nucleotides O
encoding O
261 O
amino O

and O
was O
found O
to O
have O
approximately O
70% O

mouse B-Species
UCK O

four O
band O

suggesting O
the O
UCK O
gene O

have O
at O

4 O
exons. O
A O
truncated O
form O
of O
UCK O
cDNA O
was O
expressed O
as O
the O
His-tag O

protein O
in O
Escherichia B-Species

The O
expressed O

purified O
protein O
specifically O
converted O
uridine B-Chemical
and O
cytidine B-Chemical
to O
their O
corresponding O
monophosphates O
and O

as O
5-fluorouridine, B-Chemical
cyclopentenyl-cytosine B-Chemical
and O
3'-C-ethynylcytidine. B-Chemical
The O
present O
results O
suggest O
that O
our O
cloned O
human B-Species
UCK O
cDNA O
encodes O
the O
correct O
amino O
acid O
sequence O
for O
UCK O
protein, O
