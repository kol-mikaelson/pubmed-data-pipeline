# Abstract
It O
has O
been O
proposed O
that O
GLUT1, B-Gene
a O
membrane O
protein O
that O
transports O
hexoses B-Chemical
and O
the O
oxidized O
form O
of O
vitamin B-Chemical
C, I-Chemical
dehydroascorbic B-Chemical
acid, I-Chemical
is O
also O
a O
transporter O
of O
nicotinamide B-Chemical
(Sofue, O

Nishida, O
M., O
and O
Kawada, O
J. O
(1992) O
Biochem. O

288, O
669-674). O
To O
ascertain O
this, O
we O
studied O
the O
transport O
of O
2-deoxy-D-glucose, B-Chemical
3-O-methyl-D-glucose, B-Chemical
and O
nicotinamide B-Chemical
in O
human B-Species
erythrocytes O
and O
right-side-out O
and O
inside-out O
erythrocyte O
membrane O
vesicles. O
The O
transport O
of O
nicotinamide B-Chemical
was O
saturable, O
with O
a O
K(M) O
for O
influx O
and O
efflux O
of O
6.1 O
and O
6.2 O
mM, O
respectively. O
We O
found O
that O
transport O
of O
the O
hexoses B-Chemical
was O
not O
competed O
by O
nicotinamide B-Chemical
in O
both O
the O
erythrocytes O
and O
the O
erythrocyte O
vesicles. O
Likewise, O
the O
transport O
of O
nicotinamide B-Chemical
was O
not O
affected O
by O
hexoses B-Chemical
or O
by O
inhibitors O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
transport O
such O
as O
cytochalasin B-Chemical
B, I-Chemical
genistein, B-Chemical
and O
myricetin. B-Chemical
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
nicotinamide B-Chemical
blocked O
the O
binding O
of O
cytochalasin B-Chemical
B I-Chemical
to O
human B-Species
erythrocyte O
membranes O
but O
did O
so O
in O
a O
noncompetitive O
manner. O
Using O
GLUT1-transfected O
CHO B-CellLine
cells, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
increased O
expression O
of O
GLUT1 B-Gene
was O
paralleled O
by O
a O
corresponding O
increase O
in O
hexose B-Chemical
transport O
but O
that O
there O
were O
no O
changes O
in O
nicotinamide B-Chemical
transport. O
Moreover, O
nicotinamide B-Chemical
failed O
to O
affect O
the O
transport O
of O
hexoses B-Chemical
in O
both O
control O
and O
GLUT1-transfected O
CHO B-CellLine
cells. O
Therefore, O
our O
results O
indicates O
that O
GLUT1 B-Gene
does O
not O
transport O
nicotinamide, B-Chemical
and O
we O
propose O
instead O
the O
existence O
of O
other O
systems O
for O
the O
translocation O
of O
nicotinamide B-Chemical
across O
cell O
membranes. O
