# Abstract
The O
in O
vivo O
intestinal O
metabolism O
of O
the O
CYP3A B-Gene
probe O
midazolam B-Chemical
to O
its O
principal O
metabolite, O
1'-hydroxymidazolam, B-Chemical
was O
investigated O
during O
surgery O
in O
10 O
liver O
transplant O
recipients. O
After O
removal O
of O
the O
diseased B-Disease
liver, I-Disease
five O
subjects O
received O
2 O
mg O
midazolam B-Chemical
intraduodenally, O
and O
the O
other O
five O
received O
1 O
mg O
midazolam B-Chemical
intravenously. O
Simultaneous O
arterial O
and O
hepatic O
portal O
venous O
blood O
samples O
were O
collected O
during O
the O
anhepatic O
phase; O
collection O
of O
arterial O
samples O
continued O
after O
reperfusion O
of O
the O
donor O
liver. O
Midazolam, B-Chemical
1'-hydroxymidazolam, B-Chemical
and O
1'-hydroxymidazolam B-Chemical
glucuronide I-Chemical
were O
measured O
in O
plasma. O
A O
mass O
balance O
approach O
that O
considered O
the O
net O
change O
in O
midazolam B-Chemical
(intravenously) O
or O
midazolam B-Chemical
and O
1'-hydroxymidazolam B-Chemical
(intraduodenally) O
concentrations O
across O
the O
splanchnic O
vascular O
bed O
during O
the O
anhepatic O
phase O
was O
used O
to O
quantitate O
the O
intestinal O
extraction O
of O
midazolam B-Chemical
after O
each O
route O
of O
administration. O
For O
the O
intraduodenal O
group, O
the O
mean O
fraction O
of O
the O
absorbed O
midazolam B-Chemical
dose O
that O
was O
metabolized O
on O
transit O
through O
the O
intestinal O
mucosa O
was O
0.43 O
+ O
- O
0.18. O
For O
the O
intravenous O
group, O
the O
mean O
fraction O
of O
midazolam B-Chemical
extracted O
from O
arterial O
blood O
and O
metabolized O
during O
each O
passage O
through O
the O
splanchnic O
vascular O
bed O
was O
0.08 O
+ O
- O
0.11. O
Although O
there O
was O
significant O
intersubject O
variability, O
the O
mean O
intravenous O
and O
intraduodenal O
extraction O
fractions O
were O
statistically O
different O
(p O
= O
0.009). O
Collectively, O
these O
results O
show O
that O
the O
small O
intestine O
contributes O
significantly O
to O
the O
first-pass O
oxidative O
metabolism O
of O
midazolam B-Chemical
catalyzed O
by O
mucosal O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
and O
suggest O
that O
significant O
first-pass O
metabolism O
may O
be O
a O
general O
phenomenon O
for O
all O
high-turnover O
CYP3A4 B-Gene
substrates. O
