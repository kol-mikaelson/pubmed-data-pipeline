# Abstract
Cystathionine B-Gene
gamma-lyase I-Gene
(CGL) O
is O
the O
last O
enzyme O
of O
the O
trans-sulphuration O
pathway, O
which O
converts O
methionine B-ProteinMutation
into I-ProteinMutation
cysteine. I-ProteinMutation
To O
study O
the O
possible O
differences O
in O
enzymic O
activity O
of O
the O
two O
human B-Species
cystathionine B-Gene
gamma-lyase I-Gene
isoforms O
characterized O
earlier, O
these O
were O
separately O
expressed O
in O
human B-Species
kidney O
embryonic O
293T B-CellLine
cells. O
Furthermore, O
developmental O
changes O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
two O
mRNA O
forms O
as O
well O
as O
the O
enzymic O
activity O
in O
human B-Species
liver O
were O
studied, O
as O
it O
has O
been O
postulated O
that O
a O
change O
in O
the O
relative O
expression O
of O
CGL O
isoforms O
causes O
the O
postnatal O
increase O
in O
CGL O
activity. O
Transfection O
with O
the O
longer O
isoform O
increased O
the O
CGL O
activity O
1.5-fold, O
while O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
cells O
transfected O
with O
the O
shorter O
form O
did O
not O
differ O
from O
the O
basal O
activity. O
In O
human B-Species
liver O
samples, O
CGL O
activity O
was O
only O
detected O
in O
adult O
tissue O
(68+ O
-9 O
nmol O
of O
cysteine O
h O
per O
mg O
of O
protein), O
whereas O
activity O
in O
fetal, O
premature O
and O
full-term O
neonatal O
liver O
tissue O
was O
undetectable. O
In O
contrast, O
strong O
mRNA O
expression O
of O
both O
mRNA O
isoforms O
was O
detected O
from O
the O
19th O
gestational O
week O
onwards O
and O
the O
longer O
form O
of O
CGL O
appeared O
to O
be O
predominant. O
The O
expression O
of O
the O
two O
mRNA O
forms O
varied O
in O
parallel. O
In O
conclusion, O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
only O
cells O
overexpressing O
the O
longer O
form O
of O
CGL O
have O
increased O
activity, O
and O
CGL O
appears O
to O
be O
regulated O
at O
the O
post-transcriptional O
level O
during O
development. O
