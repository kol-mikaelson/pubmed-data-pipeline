# Abstract
Mechanism O

interaction O
of O
antidiabetic O
drugs, O
repaglinide B-Chemical
and O
gliclazide, B-Chemical
to O
human B-Species
serum I-Species
albumin I-Species
has O
been O
studied O
using O
fluorescence O
spectroscopic O
technique. O
Repaglinide B-Chemical
had O
much O
higher O
affinity O
for O
human B-Species
serum I-Species
albumin I-Species
when O
compared O
with O
gliclazide. B-Chemical
The O
order O

10(5) O
for O
both O

The O
size, O
hydrophobicity O
and O

of O
the O

molecules O
play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
explaining O
the O
binding O
behaviour O
of O
these O
drugs. O
Hydrophobic O
interactions O
are O
predominantly O
involved O
in O
the O
binding. O
However, O
drugs O
do O
not O
share O
common O
sites O
with O
1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonate B-Chemical
on O
the O
human B-Species
serum I-Species
albumin I-Species
molecule. O
Both O
tyrosine B-Chemical
and O
tryptophan B-Chemical
residues O
participate O
in O
the O
interaction. O
Repaglinide B-Chemical
and O
gliclazide B-Chemical
are O
bound O
to O

the O
human B-Species

molecule, O
and O
the O
aromatic O
ring O
of O
411Tyr O
appears O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
binding O
within O
site O
II. O
Although O
they O
do O
not O
bind O
at O
site O
I, O
their O
binding O
at O
site O
II O
may O
cause O
conformational O
changes O
thereby O
affecting O
the O
binding O
of O
other O
ligands O
to O
site O
I. O
Site-specificity O
can O
be O
useful O
in O
predicting O
the O
competitive O
displacement O
of O
these O
drugs O
by O
other O
co-administered O
drugs, O
