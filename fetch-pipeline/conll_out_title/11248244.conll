# Abstract
Nicotinamide B-Gene
mononucleotide I-Gene
adenylyl I-Gene
transferase I-Gene
(NMNAT) B-Gene
is O
an O
essential O
enzyme O
in O
all O
organisms, O
because O
it O
catalyzes O
a O
key O
step O
of O
NAD B-Chemical
synthesis. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
structure O
and O
regulation O
of O
this O
enzyme. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
established O
the O
primary O
structure O
of O
human B-Species
NMNAT. B-Gene
The O
human B-Species
sequence O
represents O
the O
first O
report O
of O
the O
primary O
structure O
of O
this O
enzyme O
for O
an O
organism O
higher O
than O
yeast. B-Species
The O
enzyme O
was O
purified O
from O
human B-Species
placenta O
and O
internal O
peptide O
sequences O
determined. O
Analysis O
of O
human B-Species
DNA O
sequence O
data O
then O
permitted O
the O
cloning O
of O
a O
cDNA O
encoding O
this O
enzyme. O
Recombinant O
NMNAT B-Gene
exhibited O
catalytic O
properties O
similar O
to O
the O
originally O
purified O
enzyme. O
Human B-Species
NMNAT B-Gene
(molecular O
weight O
31932) O
consists O
of O
279 O
amino O
acids O
and O
exhibits O
substantial O
structural O
differences O
to O
the O
enzymes O
from O
lower O
organisms. O
A O
putative O
nuclear O
localization O
signal O
was O
confirmed O
by O
immunofluorescence O
studies. O
NMNAT B-Gene
strongly O
inhibited O
recombinant O
human B-Species
poly(ADP-ribose) B-Chemical
polymerase I-Gene
1, I-Gene
however, O
NMNAT B-Gene
was O
not O
modified O
by O
poly(ADP-ribose). B-Chemical
NMNAT B-Gene
appears O
to O
be O
a O
substrate O
of O
nuclear O
kinases O
and O
contains O
at O
least O
three O
potential O
phosphorylation O
sites. O
Endogenous O
and O
recombinant O
NMNAT B-Gene
were O
phosphorylated O
in O
nuclear O
extracts O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
[gamma-(32)P]ATP. B-Chemical
We O
propose O
that O
NMNAT's O
activity O
or O
interaction O
with O
nuclear O
proteins O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
modulated O
by O
phosphorylation. O
