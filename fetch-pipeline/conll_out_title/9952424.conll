# Abstract
Methamphetamine-induced O
toxicity B-Disease
has O
been O
shown O
to O
require O
striatal O
dopamine B-Chemical
and O
to O
involve O
mechanisms O
associated O
with O
oxidative O
stress. O
Dopamine B-Chemical
is O
a O
reactive O
molecule O
that O
can O
oxidize O
to O
form O
free B-Chemical
radicals I-Chemical
and O
reactive O
quinones. B-Chemical
Although O
this O
has O
been O
suggested O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
mechanism O
of O
toxicity, B-Disease
the O
oxidation O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
has O
never O
been O
directly O
measured O
after O
methamphetamine B-Chemical
exposure. O
In O
this O
study O
we O
sought O
to O
determine O
whether O
methamphetamine-induced O
toxicity B-Disease
is O
associated O
with O
the O
oxidation O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
by O
measuring O
the O
binding O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
quinones I-Chemical
to O
cysteinyl O
residues O
on O
protein. O
We O
observed O
that O
administration O
of O
neurotoxic B-Disease
doses O
of O
methamphetamine B-Chemical
to O
rats B-Species
resulted O
in O
a O
two- O
to O
threefold O
increase O
in O
protein O
cysteinyl-dopamine B-Chemical
in O
the O
striatum O
2, O
4, O
and O
8 O
hr O
after O
treatment. O
When O
methamphetamine B-Chemical
was O
administered O
at O
an O
ambient O
temperature O
of O
5 O
degreesC, O
no O
increase O
in O
dopamine B-Chemical
oxidation O
products O
was O
observed, O
and O
toxicity B-Disease
was O
prevented. O
Furthermore, O
as O
shown O
by O
striatal O
microdialysis, O
animals O
treated O
with O
methamphetamine B-Chemical
at O
5 O
degreesC O
showed O
DA B-Chemical
release O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
animals O
treated O
at O
room O
temperature. O
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
toxicity B-Disease
of O
methamphetamine B-Chemical
and O
the O
associated O
increase O
in O
dopamine B-Chemical
oxidation O
are O
not O
exclusively O
the O
result O
of O
increases O
in O
extracellular O
dopamine. B-Chemical
Because O
dopamine-induced O
modifications O
of O
protein O
structure O
and O
function O
may O
result O
in O
cellular O
toxicity, B-Disease
it O
is O
likely O
that O
dopamine B-Chemical
oxidation O
contributes O
to O
methamphetamine-induced O
toxicity B-Disease
to O
dopamine B-Chemical
terminals, O
adding O
support O
to O
the O
role O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
and O
the O
evidence O
of O
oxidative O
stress O
in O
this O
lesion O
model. O
