# Abstract
Eosinophil B-Gene
peroxidase I-Gene
(EPO) O
has O
been O
implicated O
in O
promoting O
oxidative O
tissue B-Disease
injury I-Disease
in O
conditions O
ranging O
from O
asthma B-Disease
and O
other O
allergic B-Disease
inflammatory B-Disease
disorders I-Disease
to O
cancer B-Disease
and O
parasitic B-Disease
helminthic I-Disease
infections. I-Disease
Studies O
thus O
far O
on O
this O
unique O
peroxidase O
have O
primarily O
focused O
on O
its O
unusual O
substrate O
preference O
for O
bromide B-Chemical
(Br(-)) B-Chemical
and O
the O
pseudohalide B-Chemical
thiocyanate B-Chemical
(SCN(-)) B-Chemical
forming O
potent O
hypohalous B-Chemical
acids I-Chemical
as O
cytotoxic O
oxidants. O
However, O
the O
ability O
of O
EPO O
to O
generate O
reactive B-Chemical
nitrogen I-Chemical
species I-Chemical
has O
not O
yet O
been O
reported. O
We O
now O
demonstrate O
that O
EPO O
readily O
uses O
nitrite B-Chemical
(NO(2)(-)), B-Chemical
a O
major O
end-product O
of O
nitric B-Chemical
oxide I-Chemical
((.)NO) O
metabolism, O
as O
substrate O
to O
generate O
a O
reactive O
intermediate O
that O
nitrates O
protein O
tyrosyl O
residues O
in O
high O
yield. O
EPO-catalyzed O
nitration O
of O
tyrosine B-Chemical
occurred O
more O
readily O
than O
bromination O
at O
neutral O
pH, O
plasma O
levels O
of O
halides, B-Chemical
and O
pathophysiologically O
relevant O
concentrations O
of O
NO(2)(-). B-Chemical
Furthermore, O
EPO O
was O
significantly O
more O
effective O
than O
MPO B-Gene
at O
promoting O
tyrosine B-Chemical
nitration O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
plasma O
levels O
of O
halides. B-Chemical
Whereas O
recent O
studies O
suggest O
that O
MPO B-Gene
can O
also O
promote O
protein O
nitration O
through O
indirect O
oxidation O
of O
NO(2)(-) B-Chemical
with O
HOCl, B-Chemical
we O
found O
no O
evidence O
that O
EPO O
can O
indirectly O
mediate O
protein O
nitration O
by O
a O
similar O
reaction O
between O
HOBr B-Chemical
and O
NO(2)(-). B-Chemical
EPO-dependent O
nitration O
of O
tyrosine B-Chemical
was O
modulated O
over O
a O
physiologically O
relevant O
range O
of O
SCN(-) B-Chemical
concentrations O
and O
was O
accompanied O
by O
formation O
of O
tyrosyl O
radical O
addition O
products O
(e.g. O
o,o'-dityrosine, B-Chemical
pulcherosine, B-Chemical
trityrosine). B-Chemical
The O
potential O
role O
of O
specific O
antioxidants O
and O
nucleophilic O
scavengers O
on O
yields O
of O
tyrosine B-Chemical
nitration O
and O
bromination O
by O
EPO O
are O
examined. O
Thus, O
EPO O
may O
contribute O
to O
nitrotyrosine B-Chemical
formation O
in O
inflammatory B-Disease
conditions O
characterized O
by O
recruitment O
and O
activation O
of O
eosinophils. O
