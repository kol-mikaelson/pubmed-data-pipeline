# Abstract
In O
a O
search O
for O
the O
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical

mechanisms O
to O
the O
enterocyte O
we O
cloned O
and O
sequenced O
an O
intestinal O
subtype O
of O
the O
Na(+)HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical
cotransporter O
isoform O
I O
(dNBC1), O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
identical O
to O
the O
pancreatic O
NBC1 B-Gene
subtype O
(pNBC1). O
Within O
the O
intestine, O
we O
found O
particularly O
high O
NBC1 B-Gene
expression O
levels O
in O
the O
duodenum O
and O
proximal O
colon. O
Experiments O
with O

Ussing-chambers O

that O
Na(+)HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical

were O
equally O
important O
duodenal O
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical
supply O
pathways O
and O
were O
both O
upregulated O
during O
cAMP-mediated O
secretion. O
In O
the O
proximal O
colon, O
however, O
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical
secretion O
was O
low O
but O
NBC1 B-Gene
expression O
even O
higher O
than O
in O
the O
duodenum. O
Ussing-chamber O
experiments O
with O
an O
NBC-specific O
inhibitor O
revealed O
that O
NBC, B-Gene
coupled O
to O
basolateral O
Cl(-) O
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical
exchange, O
was O
an O
important O
alternative O
Cl(-) O

cystic B-Gene

Although O
forskolin B-Chemical

only O

to O
a O
similar O

in O
both O

We O
conclude O
that, O
depending O
on O
the O
intestinal O
segment, O
NBC1 B-Gene
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
basolateral O
HCO(3)(-) B-Chemical

uptake. O
Expression O
