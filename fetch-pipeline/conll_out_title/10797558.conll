# Abstract
3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde B-Chemical
(DOPAL) B-Chemical
has O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
a O
toxic O
metabolite O
formed O
by O
the O
oxidative-deamination O
of O
dopamine B-Chemical
(DA) B-Chemical
catalyzed O
by O
monoamine O
oxidase. O
This O
aldehyde B-Chemical
is O
either O
oxidized O
to O
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic B-Chemical
acid I-Chemical
(DOPAC) B-Chemical
by O
aldehyde B-Chemical
dehydrogenase, O
an O
NAD-dependent O
enzyme O
or O
reduced O
to O
3, B-Chemical
4-dihydroxyphenylethanol I-Chemical
(DOPET) B-Chemical
by O
aldehyde B-Chemical
or O
aldose B-Gene
reductase. I-Gene
In O
the O
present O
study O
we O
examined O
whether O
levels O
of O
DOPAL B-Chemical
are O
elevated O
by O
inhibition O
of O
the O
mitochondrial O
respiratory O
chain. O
Using O
inhibitors O
of O
mitochondrial O
complexes O
I, O
II, O
III O
and O
IV O
we O
found O
that O
inhibition O
of O
complex O
I O
and O
III O
increased O
levels O
of O
DOPAL B-Chemical
and O
DOPET. B-Chemical

DOPAL B-Chemical

Because O

in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
Parkinson's B-Disease

the O
accumulation O
of O
DOPAL B-Chemical
may O
explain O
the O
vulnerability O
of O
the O
dopaminergic O
system O
to O
complex O

inhibition. O
The O
rapid O
appearance O
of O
DOPAL B-Chemical
and O
DOPET B-Chemical
after O
inhibition O
of O
complex O
I O
may O
be O
a O

neurons. O
