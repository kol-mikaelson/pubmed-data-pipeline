# Abstract
Transport O
of O
selenomethionine B-Chemical
(Se-Met) B-Chemical
and O
its O
sulfur B-Chemical
analogue, O
methionine B-Chemical
(Met), B-Chemical
across O
the O
pig B-Species
jejunal O
brush O
border O
membrane O
(BBM) O
was O
investigated O
using O
isolated O
BBM O
vesicles. O
Experiments O
were O
also O
performed O
to O
gain O
insight O
into O
the O
transport O
mechanism(s) O
for O
selenocystine. B-Chemical
Se-Met B-Chemical
as O
well O
as O
Met B-Chemical
were O
transported O
by O
a O
single, O
Na+-dependent, O
carrier-mediated O
process O
common O
for O
both O
amino O
acids. O
Evaluation O
of O
the O
kinetic O
parameters O
revealed O
no O
differences O
between O
Se-Met B-Chemical
and O
Met B-Chemical
in O
the O
maximal O
transport O
velocity O
(Vmax) O
or O
in O
the O
Michaelis O
constant O
(Km). O
Furthermore, O
transport O
of O
Se-Met B-Chemical
and O
Met B-Chemical
showed O
similar O
characteristics O
with O
respect O
to O
electrogenicity O
and O
substrate O
specificity. O
In O
addition, O
evidence O
was O
obtained O
for O
a O
competitive O
inhibition O
of O
cystine B-Chemical
transport O
across O
the O
BBM O
by O
selenocystine B-Chemical

basic O
amino O
