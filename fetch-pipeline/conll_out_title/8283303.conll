# Abstract
The O
epithelial O
cells O
of O
the O
gastrointestinal O
tract O
are O
the O
first O
to O
encounter O
ingested O
nucleotides. O
Enterocytes O
metabolize O
or O
transport O
nucleotides O
(often O
partially O
metabolized) O
to O
other O
cell O
types. O
Nucleotides O
may O
also O
affect O
enterocyte O
gene O
expression. O
These O
interactions O
in O
intestinal O
cell O
lines O
(Caco-2 B-CellLine
and O
IEC-6 B-CellLine
cells) O
are O
described. O
Nucleotides O
and O
nucleosides O
are O
efficiently O
taken O
up O
by O
neoplastic B-Disease
cells O
(Caco-2) B-CellLine
and O
substantially O
metabolized O
during O
absorption O
by O
epithelial O
monolayers. O
In O
nonmalignant O
cells O
(IEC-6), B-CellLine
nucleotide O
pools O
are O
smaller O
than O
enterocytes O
of O
neoplastic B-Disease
origin O
(Caco-2). B-CellLine
Consequently, O
cell O
proliferation O
in O
IEC-6 B-CellLine
cells O
is O
more O
dependent O
on O
an O
external O
supply O
of O
nucleotides. O
Cell O
differentiation O
was O
examined O
by O
measuring O
brush O
border O
enzyme O
activities O
(sucrase, B-Gene
lactase B-Gene
and O
alkaline O
phosphatase). O
Nucleotides O
enhanced O
the O
expression O
of O
brush O
border O
enzymes O
in O
carcinoma B-Disease
cells O
only O
when O
stressed O
by O
glutamine O
deprivation. O
IEC-6 B-CellLine
cells, O
which O
are O
poorly O
differentiated O
in O
optimal O
media, O
require O
basement O
membrane O
(Matrigel) O
for O
expression O
of O
brush O
border O
enzymes. O
Under O
these O
conditions, O
adding O
nucleotides O
to O
the O
culture O
medium O
enhanced O
enzyme O
activity. O
In O
addition O
to O
being O
substrates O
for O
intestinal O
absorption, O
nucleotides O
may O
affect O
enterocyte O
differentiation. O
