# Abstract
The O
purpose O
of O
this O
work O
was O
to O
identify O
human B-Species
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases O
(UGTs) O
capable O
of O
glucuronidating O
dopamine. B-Chemical
Using O
a O
sensitive O
liquid O
chromatography-tandem O
mass O
spectrometry O
method, O
we O
screened O
all O
19 O
known O
human B-Species
UGTs O
and O
found O
that O
only O
one O
enzyme, O
UGT1A10, B-Gene
catalyzed O
dopamine B-Chemical
glucuronidation O
at O
substantial O
rates, O
yielding O
both O
dopamine-4-O-glucuronide B-Chemical
(37.1 O

mg) O
and O
dopamine-3-O-glucuronide B-Chemical
(32.7 O

by O
quantitative O

confirmed O
that O
it O
is O
mainly O
expressed O
in O
small O
intestine, O

tissue, O
whereas O
only O
low O

were O
found O
in O
trachea, O
stomach, O

and O

but O
not O

Dopamine B-Chemical
glucuronidation O
assays O
using O
microsomes O
from O
human B-Species
liver O
and O
intestine O
corroborated O
these O
findings O
because O
activity O
in O
intestinal O
microsomes O
was O
markedly O
higher O
than O
that O
in O
liver O
microsomes. O
Moreover, O
the O
glucuronidation O
regioselectivity O
in O
intestinal O
microsomes O
was O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
recombinant O
UGT1A10, B-Gene
and O
both O
enzyme O
sources O
exhibited O
sigmoidal O
kinetics O
with O
substrate O
affinity O
(K(A)) O
values O
in O
the O
range O
of O
2 O
to O
3 O
mM. O
Examination O
of O
four O
UGT1A10 B-Gene
mutants, O
F90A, B-ProteinMutation
F90L, B-ProteinMutation
F93A, B-ProteinMutation
and O
F93L, B-ProteinMutation
revealed O
lower O
dopamine B-Chemical
glucuronidation O
in O
all O
of O
them, O
particularly O
in O
F90A B-ProteinMutation
and O
F93A. B-ProteinMutation
Nonetheless, O
the O
substrate O
affinities O
of O
the O
four O
mutants O
were O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
UGT1A10. B-Gene
It O
is O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O
mutant O
F93L B-ProteinMutation
exhibited O
regioselectivity, O
conjugating O
dopamine B-Chemical
at O
the O
4-hydroxyl O
(OH) O
position O
approximately O
3 O
times O
more O
efficiently O
than O
at O
the O
3-OH O
position. O
These O
results O
shed O
new O
light O
on O
the O
structure O
and O
function O
of O
UGT1A10 B-Gene
and O
indicate O
that O
dopamine B-Chemical
may O
be O
a O
useful O
probe O
substrate O
for O
this O
enzyme. O
