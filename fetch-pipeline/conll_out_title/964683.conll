been O
studied O
by O
intestinal O
perfusion O
in O
11 O
patients B-Species
with O
tropical B-Disease
sprue B-Disease
and O
10 O
control O
subjects. O
The O
patients B-Species
with O
sprue B-Disease
had O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
the O
rate O
of O
absorption O
of O
glycine B-Chemical
from O
a O
20 O
mmol O
1 O
solution, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
absorption O
of O
the O
other O
substances. O
The O
failure O
to O
demonstrate O
any O
difference O
in O
the O
absorption O
of O
these O
substances O
is O
probably O
related O
to O
their O
low O
concentration O
relative O
to O
the O
maximum O
absorptive O
capacity O
of O
the O
intestine. O
In O
both O
groups O
of O
subjects O
the O
kinetic O
advantage O
of O
glycyl-glycine B-Chemical
absorption O
as O
compared O
with O
glycine B-Chemical
absorption O
was O
maintained. O
When O
the O
dipeptides B-Chemical
were O
perfused, O
free O
amino O
acids O
appeared O
in O
the O
perfusate O
presumably O
by O
"back O
diffusion" O
from O
the O
mucosal O
cells. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
glycyl-L-leucine B-Chemical
considerably O
more O
glycine B-Chemical
and O
leucine B-Chemical
were O
found O
in O
the O
perfusate O
in O
patients B-Species
with O
sprue B-Disease
than O
in O
the O
control O
subjects. O
There O
was O
no O
correlation O
between O
peptide O
absorption O
and O
the O
concentration O
of O
total O
glycly-glycine O
hydrolase O
and O
glycyl-L-leucine B-Chemical
hydrolase, O
measured O
as O
combined O
brush O
border O
and O
cytosol O
enzymes. O
The O
concentrations O
of O
these O
enzymes O
were O
similar O
in O
both O
groups O
of O
subjects. O
