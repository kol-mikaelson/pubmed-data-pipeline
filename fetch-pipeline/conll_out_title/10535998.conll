# Abstract
High O
endothelial O
venules O
(HEV) O
are O
specialized O
postcapillary O
venules O
found O
in O
lymphoid O
organs O
and O
chronically O
inflamed O
tissues O
that O
support O
high O
levels O
of O
lymphocyte O

from O
the O
blood. O
One O

the O
major O
characteristics O
of O
HEV O
endothelial O

(HEVEC) O
is O
their O

Together, O
these O
