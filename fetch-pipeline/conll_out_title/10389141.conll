# Abstract
MAO B-Gene
(monoamine B-Chemical
oxidase) I-Gene
A I-Gene
and I-Gene
B I-Gene
are O
key O
isoenzymes O
that O
degrade O
biogenic O
and O
dietary O
amines. B-Chemical
MAO B-Gene
A I-Gene
preferentially O
oxidizes O
serotonin B-Chemical
(5-hydroxytryptamine, B-Chemical
5-HT) B-Chemical
and O
norepinephrine B-Chemical
(NE), O
whereas O
MAO B-Gene
B I-Gene
preferentially O
oxidizes O
phenylethylamine B-Chemical
(PEA). B-Chemical
Both O
forms O
can O
oxidize O
dopamine B-Chemical
(DA). B-Chemical
However, O
the O
substrate O
specificity O
overlap O
and O
the O
in O
vivo O
function O
of O
these O
two O
isoenzymes O
is O
not O
clear. O
Recently, O
we O
have O
shown O
that O
MAO B-Gene
A I-Gene
and I-Gene
B I-Gene
knock-out O
(KO) O
mice B-Species
exhibit O
distinct O
differences O
in O
neurotransmitter O
metabolism O
and O
behavior. O
MAO B-Gene
A I-Gene
KO O
mice B-Species
have O
elevated O
brain O
levels O
of O
5-HT, B-Chemical
NE O
and O
DA B-Chemical
and O
manifest O
aggressive B-Disease
behavior I-Disease
similar O
to O
men B-Species
with O
a O
deletion O
of O
MAO B-Gene
A. I-Gene
In O
contrast, O
MAO B-Gene
B I-Gene
KO O
mice B-Species
do O
not O
exhibit O
aggression B-Disease
and O
only O
levels O
of O
PEA B-Chemical
are O
increased. O
Both O
MAO B-Gene
A I-Gene
and I-Gene
B I-Gene
KO O
mice B-Species
show O
increased O
reactivity O
to O
stress. O
Taken O
together, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
MAO B-Gene
A I-Gene
and I-Gene
B I-Gene
have O
distinctly O
different O
roles O
in O
monoamine B-Chemical
metabolism. O
Further, O
these O
mice B-Species
are O
valuable O
models O
for O
investigating O
the O
role O
of O
monoamines B-Chemical
in O
psychoses B-Disease
and O
neurodegenerative B-Disease
and I-Disease
stress-related I-Disease
disorders. I-Disease
