# Abstract
We O
previously O
reported O
that O
glucose B-Chemical
can O
be O
released O
from O
GLUT2-null O
hepatocytes O
through O
a O
membrane O
traffic-based O
pathway O
issued O
from O
the O
endoplasmic O
reticulum. O
Here, O
we O
further O
characterized O
this O
glucose B-Chemical
release O
mechanism O
using O
biosynthetic O
labeling O
protocols. O
In O
continuous O
pulse-labeling O
experiments, O
we O
determined O
that O
glucose B-Chemical
secretion O
proceeded O
linearly O
and O
with O
the O
same O
kinetics O
in O
control O
and O
GLUT2-null O
hepatocytes. O
In O
GLUT2-deficient O
hepatocytes, O
however, O
a O
fraction O
of O
newly O
synthesized O
glucose B-Chemical
accumulated O
intracellularly. O
The O
linear O
accumulation O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
in O
the O
medium O
was O
inhibited O
in O
mutant, O
but O
not O
in O
control, O
hepatocytes O
by O
progesterone B-Chemical
and O
low O
temperature, O
as O
previously O
reported, O
but, O
importantly, O
also O
by O
microtubule O
disruption. O
The O
intracellular O
pool O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
was O
shown O
to O
be O
present O
in O
the O
cytosol, O
and, O
in O
pulse-chase O
experiments, O
it O
was O
shown O
to O
be O
released O
at O
a O
relatively O
slow O
rate. O
Release O
was O
not O
inhibited O
by O
S-4048 B-Chemical
(an O
inhibitor O
of O
glucose-6-phosphate B-Gene
translocase), I-Gene
cytochalasin B-Chemical
B, I-Chemical
or O
progesterone. B-Chemical
It O
was O
inhibited O
by O
phloretin, B-Chemical
carbonyl B-Chemical
cyanide I-Chemical
p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, I-Chemical
and O
low O
temperature. O
We O
conclude O
that O
the O
major O
release O
pathway O
segregates O
glucose B-Chemical
away O
from O
the O
cytosol O
by O
use O
of O
a O
membrane O
traffic-based, O
microtubule-dependent O
mechanism O
and O
that O
the O
release O
of O
the O
cytosolic O
pool O
of O
newly O
synthesized O
glucose, B-Chemical
through O
an O
as O
yet O
unidentified O
plasma O
membrane O
transport O
system, O
cannot O
account O
for O
the O
bulk O
of O
glucose B-Chemical
release. O
